NAFLD,1ogk2ec,How did this happen?,"24 yr old; F; 5'7"" 165 pounds. High alkaline phosphatase (144) led to an ultrasound which diagnosed me with NAFL. I'm 6 months postpartum, and during my last blood test and ultrasound when I was pregnant my liver was completely normal. I also passed the 1 hr glucose test which checks for gestational diabetes. The doctor who quickly diagnosed me with NAFL last week told me to see my primary dr to test for type 2 diabetes as l am really not THAT over weight and don't drink. Here's the kicker - my diet is awful. I live off of sugars, carbs, and processed foods. Is it possible I just developed NAFL in the last 6 months purely because of my diet?
I'll go through with getting tested for diabetes but this time last year I passed a glucose test and really don't have any symptoms of diabetes?

NAFLD,1nvq5tr,Please help. I need some info.,"Hi guys,

I'm reall concerned here. Please go through this.

I’ve had tinea barbae for about 18 months. It’s localized but hasn’t cleared despite 5 months of topical antifungals (miconazole and ketoconazole). From what I’ve read, oral antifungals are usually required, so I’m considering terbinafine.

Here’s my situation:

Back in July, my ALT was 111, which normalized to 28 within a month and has stayed normal.

No known chronic liver disease.

I’m concerned about terbinafine’s potential effect on the liver.

Transferrin levels recently improved (went from <2 to 2.2 g/L). I’m not sure if this is relevant, but I’m just adding it for context.


Questions:

1. With normal liver function tests now, is it generally safe to start terbinafine?



2. If terbinafine (or any othe oral fungal medication) affects my liver in any way, will it almost always return to normal after stopping? Do I need to worry about serious or life-threatening damage?


3. If I don’t go on oral medication, and topical treatments aren’t helping, what alternatives exist? Is there any realistic way to clear tinea barbae without oral antifungals?

4. How much risk do I have of developing jaundice while on terbinafine, and what precautions or warning signs should I monitor to prevent it?


5. Will it casue death ? I've heard something about it affecting hormones and other things in the body some way. Please let me know I'm really concerned. Should i skip it ? How else do i cure this fungal infection ?

Thanks in advance for any guidance or personal experiences.",0.0,https://i.redd.it/3h4lrtvyllsf1.jpeg,Important-Pen3248,2025-10-01 18:06:39,0.0,post,,,

NAFLD,1my7dix,What does onset timeframe typically look like?,"I’m a 32 year old female dealing with a host of health issues, including something autoimmune that’s being investigated but not yet treated. 

My ALT has been elevated off and on for a few years now, but the highest reading was mid 60’s and no doctor was even mildly concerned. My AST was always within a normal range. 

My ALT and AST looked good this spring and then I had a CMP done on 7/22 that showed both labs were in the mid 20’s, which is the best I’d seen them in a long while! However, I had another CMP done ordered through my dermatologist so that we could trial Humira for my HS and (potentially) RA. My ALT came back in the 120’s and AST was in the 70’s. I’d been having pain in my stomach, back, and right side, but that wasn’t super out of the ordinary for me with all the symptoms I’ve suffered from for the last several years. I asked my primary care and she said that it fluctuates sometimes and it probably didn’t mean anything. I asked if I could have an ultrasound of my liver. I just got those results in the patient portal and it was pretty unremarkable except a mild fatty liver (in more medical terms). 

Is it common for that rapid of a spike even with just “mild” fatty liver? I do not drink alcohol, but my regular supplements include magnesium citrate and/or taurate daily, vitamin D 10000 iu maybe twice per week to help maintain after overcoming a deficiency, a half of a dose of methylated b complex daily, and I had started taking krill oil to help with my inflammation, though I’ve held off just in case that is an unexpected contributor. I also had an iron infusion the Friday before these test results, but my doctor told me it’s unrelated.

	•	CAP (Controlled Attenuation Parameter): 234 dB/m
→ This measures fat in the liver (steatosis).
	•	< 238 dB/m = S0 (no steatosis)
	•	238–259 = S1 (mild steatosis)
	•	260–290 = S2 (moderate steatosis)
	•	290 = S3 (severe steatosis)
👉 Your result (234) is below 238, so no or minimal fatty change.
	•	Liver stiffness (E Median): 13.8 kPa
→ This measures fibrosis/scarring.
	•	< 7.0 = F0–F1 (none to mild fibrosis)
	•	7.0–9.5 = F2 (moderate fibrosis)
	•	9.5–12.5 = F3 (advanced fibrosis)
	•	12.5 = F4 (cirrhosis)
👉 Your result (13.8 kPa) is above 12.5, consistent with F4 (cirrhosis level stiffness).

NAFLD,1msd9ee,Help with next steps,"Hi,
Late in 2024, they suspected a NAHFD via an ultrasound. Immediately, I changed my diet, removing sugars, processed foods, and bringing down carbs. I increased my exercise and activity level in general. All blood tests have come back okay, except ALT that has fluctuated slightly above the max. Fibroscan came back negative, and I have no diagnosis. I lost a few pounds, but I wasn’t terribly obese, so my results seemed to be accurate. 

Fast forward to today, my lab came back with my ALT a slightly higher than before but also another marker (MCHC) is slightly low. 

I understand that many of us have perfect blood tests but have been diagnosed. My question may be more for those in a similar situation like mine. Has anyone has faced the same results? Has somethingb come up at a later time? What would you recommend that I should do?

Good luck to all. ",2.0,https://i.redd.it/6qnrw3zu9hjf1.jpeg,limitless0512,2025-08-16 17:54:26,1.0,post,,,

They're not extreme at all. They are mildly elevated. Some PCPs wouldn't even mention them.

The official scale has an upper limit of about 50 BUT consensus is that those scales are wrong.. because huge numbers of people with NAFLD have influenced the so-called “normal limit.” In the NHS, here in the U.K., the on-line fibrosis predictor accepts anything north of 35 for ALT as evidence of NAFLD and, thus, potential risk of fibrosis.

I always wondered why the elevated liver enzymes and low platelets were not investigated earlier, considering that both of those things can happen as a result of cirrhosis of the liver.

Instead, my mother continued for years with these numbers just a little off until the liver disease advanced to the point of ascites, which landed her in the ER. On that first ER visit, they removed 14 liters of fluid from her abdomen. She was also type 2 diabetic, so she saw her dr every 3 months for management of that condition, and at no point did anyone say, hey you’ve got signs of worsening liver damage and you’re headed towards cirrhosis.

CAP [dB/m] median is 348/400. 
E [kPa] median is 5.8. Vs [m/s] median is 1.39. 

Cool. Great. Love that. Thankfully no scarring!! But because of that I do not qualify for Rezdiffra. I have PCOS at 205lbs and 5’6 height. I walk everyday, and hike on average 2x a week. I feel my diet is good other than an I occasionally binge during my cycle changes. I’ve already cut out alcohol and I am eating largely a Mediterranean diet. I guess my PCOS is that bad, that a GLP1 may be my only option. It’s been mentioned to me by every doctor I have that’s involved in knowing my fatty liver diagnosis. However, I’m the person who gets the rare and really bad side effects from almost any medication. I’m worried the side effects, both short term and long term, from a GLP-1 will be worse than me trying to do it a natural way by being stricter with my diet and exercise. 

I guess I’m just posting for support or advice. I’m kind of at a loss.  I would love to hear of your experience with a GPL-1 and which one it is you’re taking. I would also be happy to look at any social media content or other resources you recommend.

Constipation can be dealt with (magnesium, miralax). Heartburn and reflux can be dealt with (omeprazole, pepsid, tums, reflux raft, diet). Injection site irritation can be dealt with (warm shot to room temp, use benadryl cream). Even the nausea if you have it can be dealt with. Start on the low dose, go up as prescribed. Don't stuff yourself. Don't eat crap. Get protein. Use shakes if you have to.

In the ten years I have developed diabetes and high cholesterol. (Note that many times this comes before a NASH diagnosis). On meds for both and keep them in check with good blood test numbers. 

Lots of people weighing in with drugs to take, but you can improve your diet and improve your numbers. Take vitamin E, ten years ago my liver doc said this was all he could tell me to do. BTW a few years later when I did a follow up with him when my numbers spiked, he was rude and said “I already told you what to do, there is nothing else, do it or don’t, but I can’t help you”. Obviously, I never went back to him!

In addition, there are several drugs in phase 3 trials, and they are looking for people to join those. Oh, and importantly, we must manage our sugar and even access to grains. Grains turn into sugar, so they are part of the problem. And many doctors also include saturated fat in that list of things to limit. There are a few great YouTube channels that post videos often on how to keep our blood sugar lower.

Yeah, I've had a problem with sugar my whole adult life. Definitely trying to cut back, but I have a major sweet tooth, and specifically been craving cakey-type things. That sort of spongey texture. No idea why.

I've definitely been trying to add more protein and fiber to my diet. I take clear protein almost every day, especially when I go to the gym, and have been trying to find high-protein meals. I also take a multivitamin every day, and have these men's health supplement packs with stuff like omega 3 fatty acid, zinc and selenium which it says are good for liver health that I got from a local nutrition shop that I trust, but I keep neglecting to take them because it's like 5 pills and every time I take one my stomach lurches lol 

I have a meal subscription service that I won't name for fear of it being considered advertising or something lol, but I tend to look for the carb smart and high protein meals there. Not sure how much longer I'll be able to afford it tho.

Recently, I've been following this one creator on YouTube called Liam who does a lot of nutrition and health stuff. Gotten a couple really good recipes from him. Recently tried a recipe he reviewed of tortilla pizza wraps with Caesar salad, and they were SO good. I used a high fiber, high protein tortilla, which was amazing to find out existed lol

I'm still not sure at what stage I'm at with my fatty liver, so I don't know what medications or anything I'd even qualify for. I guess we'll find out after I see the specialist and probably have to go for an ultrasound.

6'0 male 222 lbs, came down from 246 so far. Have started cleaning up my diet, exercising but still dealing with some symptoms. 

So my story is I originally thought I was having gallstones and was dealing with indigestion, low energy, nausea that comes and goes, I also have this achy feeling in my mid right side back, also feel discomfort in my upper right back in the scapula I guess it would be. I also get a burning sensation that lasts a few seconds in the right abdomen and sometimes in the left stomach area.

But anyways blood work was clear, then finally decided to do a abominal ultrasound and we found out I had a fatty liver. (NAFLD) Glad we found that cause I thought I was going crazy. 

Does anyone get those symptoms above that I listed as well? I notice the symptoms all come and go. Days I feel alright and there are some that I don't feel the greatest. I don't know if me cheating on the diet a bit is what causes it to come back.

NAFLD,1lbes80,Possibly benign lesion and enlarged liver found during ultrasound.,"



35F uk. Hi, I've been struggling with abdominal pain for 4 weeks now, it started on the right like a wave like pain and then gradually became a widespread pain across the abdomen and sometimes radiating to the back. The one thing that bothers me the most is the bloating and fullness feeling I have all day like something is inflamed. At first they thought it was UTI/kidney stones due to microscopic blood in urine but ct was clear. 

Pain is ongoing and getting worse (uncomfortable specially after dinner!)  so I booked a private ultrasound. Ultrasound found liver lesion and enlargement. 

Here are the findings:

""Liver is enlarged in size and shows diffusely increased echogenecity, consistent with fatty infiltration. 

A well defined hypechoic lesion is identified showing internal vascularity in colour Doppler imaging. The lesion appears solid and circumscribed, with mo associated billiard dilatation or evidence of ascites measuring 14 x 12 x 14. 

Sonographic features are suggestive of a benign hepatic lesion, most likely focal nodular hypoplasia or a hepatic adenoma.""

For those who have this lesion and enlargement of the liver, could you please share the following:

Your symptoms
What helped you and how to manage it
Further investigations 

When I search it on Google it says lesions are normally asymptomatic so not sure why I'm in a lot of discomfort 😭. I had transvaginal, abdominal and pelvic scan so everything was normal except for my liver. 

Please could someone shed a light? Thank you ",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nafld/comments/1lbes80/possibly_benign_lesion_and_enlarged_liver_found/,Mrsdarcy2828,2025-06-14 10:56:46,9.0,post,,,

I don't drink but my diet wasn't great so I guess that caused my fatty liver. I do wonder as well if my endo affects my liver, sometimes it plays in my mind. Nhs is frustratingly so slow though. I've been referred to a liver sprcialist, ultrasound and Gyno and not heard anything at all.

Yes mines the same.. my pain started as contraction like pain on my right side (arou d ovulation).. then it went after 3-4 days then the pain came back but slightly different.. more like intense cramping pain before my period. I didn't link it to my period/cycle at the time. Genuinely thought i had kidney/bladder issues as they kept finding microscopic bloods in my urine but lab results confirmed no uti. Ended up in a&e too (this was a day before my period.. still didnt think it was my period lol) and i thought it was kidney stones, but ct scan was clear. It was only really after 2 months when I started noticing a pattern. Then had painful bowel movement during my previous period too so that's the first time my gp suspected its probably endo.

(NAFLD = Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) A simple, no-nonsense guide to understand what’s going wrong — and how to fix it with real food, fasting, and daily habits.

⸻

❓ What Is Fatty Liver (NAFLD)?

Fatty liver means there is too much fat stored inside your liver cells. This can slow down your liver’s work, affect your energy, digestion, and even your blood sugar. You may feel fine now — but if left untreated, fatty liver can become dangerous (inflammation, scarring, even liver failure).

⸻

⚠️ Why Does It Happen?

The main cause is insulin resistance.

Here’s what that means in simple terms: 1.	You eat too often — especially carbs and sugary foods. 2.	Your body makes insulin to handle the sugar. 3.	But over time, your body stops listening to insulin. 4.	So your body makes even more insulin. 5.	This causes sugar to turn into fat — and a lot of that fat ends up in the liver. 6.	High insulin also prevents the liver from burning fat.

💡 So it’s not fat that causes fatty liver — it’s too much insulin, caused by too much sugar, too many carbs, and too frequent meals.

⸻

✅ How To Fix It (Naturally and Safely)

⸻

🔁 Step 1: Start Intermittent Fasting

Fasting means taking a break from eating so your body has time to burn stored fat — including the fat in your liver.

Start like this: •	Try 12:12 (eat during 12 hours, fast for 12) •	Move to 16:8 (eat within 8 hours, fast for 16 — for example, eat from 1pm–9pm) •	Once your body is used to it, try 20:4 or even 24-hour fasts sometimes

✅ Fasting lowers insulin, gives your liver rest, and helps it clear out the fat.

🎥 Watch this fun video to learn more: https://youtu.be/3zczNctdKXs?si=SN3UGwmjUC_6rhM6

⸻

🥑 Step 2: Eat a Low-Carb, High-Fat (Keto-style) Diet

The goal is to stop feeding your body sugar and carbs, so it switches to burning fat — and that includes liver fat.

What to eat: •	✅ Meat, fish, chicken, eggs •	✅ Green leafy vegetables •	✅ Butter, ghee, coconut oil, beef or chicken fat •	✅ Herbs and spices

What to avoid: •	❌ Sugar, rice, bread, noodles, cakes •	❌ Processed foods and snacks •	❌ All seed oils (canola, corn, sunflower, soybean) •	❌ Sugary or diet drinks

✅ Stick to 2 meals a day, no snacks. If you’re ready, try OMAD (One Meal A Day).

⸻

💡 What Happens to Your Liver When You Do This?

This lifestyle helps your liver in many ways:

🔹 Fat inside the liver starts to shrink — your body uses it as fuel when you fast and eat low-carb 🔹 Liver enzymes improve — blood tests show lower ALT and AST (a sign your liver is healing) 🔹 Bile flow improves — better digestion and fat breakdown 🔹 Inflammation goes down — liver cells become healthier and less stressed 🔹 Energy goes up — as your liver gets healthier, your body works more efficiently 🔹 Blood sugar and insulin get better — less insulin needed, more stable sugar levels 🔹 The liver begins to regenerate — yes, the liver can heal itself when given the right support!

Your liver is like a hardworking engine — once the fat is cleared and the pressure is off, it can function better, detox better, and help your whole body feel better.

⸻

🌿 Step 3: Support Your Liver with Natural Supplements (Optional)

Some herbs may help support liver repair: •	Milk Thistle – protects liver cells •	Dandelion Root – helps with bile and detox •	Artichoke Leaf – helps with digestion and liver function

📝 Take these from good-quality brands. Ask your doctor first, especially if you’re on medication.

⸻

💧 Step 4: Drink Water and Add Natural Salt •	🥤 Drink at least 2 liters of water daily (mineral water is best) •	🧂 Add a pinch of sea salt — it helps with energy, focus, and prevents cramps on low-carb •	❌ Avoid sugary drinks or “zero calorie” sodas

⸻

🧘‍♂️ Final Tips for Better Liver Health •	😴 Get 6–8 hours of sleep every night •	🚶 Move daily — even a simple walk helps •	😌 Manage stress — breathing, prayer, or relaxing activities •	📆 Be consistent — healing takes time, but it works!

⸻

🎯 Summary:

Fatty Liver = Too Much Insulin Fix Insulin → Liver Fat Goes Down → Liver Works Better

✅ Intermittent Fasting ✅ Low-Carb, High-Fat Diet ✅ Water & Salt ✅ Optional Liver Supplements ✅ Daily movement + sleep

⸻

Your liver is amazing — it can heal and regenerate when you stop overworking it. Just give it the right tools, and let it do its job. You’ll feel more energy, lose weight, and get healthier over time. Be patient and keep going. You’ve got this! 💪

Even losing 5-10% body weight has been shown to have beneficial effects on the liver. The best diet is the one that you can stick with and lose weight. The Mediterranean Diet is a good starting point, has been studied for NAFLD and has many other benefits, and isn’t too extreme, so easier to stick with it. Don’t lose weight too quickly; this can exacerbate fatty liver and can lead to gallstone formation. 

Cut out the “low hanging fruit” first: simple carbs, added sugar, soda, overly processed food, fast food, fried food. Replace with whole grains, lean protein, healthy fats like nuts, vegetables, low glycemic index / low sugar fruit like berries, and fiber. Fiber is very important and overlooked imo (I’m not a doctor). Will help maintain blood sugar levels, lower cholesterol, and will keep you feeling full and satiated. Increase water intake, especially as you add fiber. 

Also recommend starting a walking regimen. Low impact “zone 2” exercise can help burn fat but also has many other health benefits. Taking a walk after a meal helps lower blood sugar spikes. Exercise doesn’t have to be complicated or intense; walking, biking, swimming are all good activities. 

Also recommend strength training. Building muscle is good for our metabolic health. Fatty liver is a metabolic disorder, similar to diabetes. 

People will fatty liver are at risk for diabetes and heart disease, so keep up with regular blood work. 

I can’t speak to your test results, but in general, fatty liver is reversible with diet changes and weight loss. Focus on making changes you can stick with; this is a marathon, not a sprint, so take it slow. You’re making lifestyle change, and it’s hard but worth it. Meditation might be helpful for health anxiety. You got this. 👍",3.0

NAFLD,1k8g8bl,Is losing weight/portioning enough?,"A lengthy read but I could really use some opinions and help! 

Male, 28, I weighed 300 pounds in December. I didn't start taking dieting and food intake seriously until late February. Early March I had a fibroscan done and showed 400 cap, 11.1 median, and 11.8 KPA. I will add to that my liver enzymes were all high but have all returned to ""normal ranges"" even though a few are still at the cusp of being considered too high. I still have daily pain in my liver area that sometimes eases off and sometimes is pretty rough. I had my gallbladder out in 2021 so it isn't my gallbladder causing pain. Feels dull yet sharp and ""ballooney"".

Fast forward a month after and no calls from the GI at all except when we called and their nurse said ""yeah, you might be right before cirrhosis, maybe not. All depends. Lose weight and come back in six months"". They absolutely refuse to do anything else for me and I'm looking to be referred to another GI but they're going to be 2-3 hours away because where I live there's nobody else to see. I've been absolutely brushed off and in the dark. I asked about Rezdiffra since I'm so far into this from the fibroscan and they said they won't prescribe it whatsoever, just lose weight. I also try to walk half an hour to a full hour a day and during my 12 hour work shifts, I am constantly on my feet walking. I've also heard fibroscans can be wrong in obese person, but I am very tender in the area which worries me that it's right. My GI also told me that gallbladder removal had nothing to do with weight gain and I just ate too much in my life and didn't need to ""sit down and eat a family sized pizza to myself every day"". His words. I was never told to take GI supplements or ox bile after my gallbladder surgery in 2021, just to eat whatever I wanted. I'm worried that is what led me to this. 

From December to April (today) I have lost 30 pounds, down to 270.3 from 300.8. I've been a picky eater all of my life and hate fish and I find grilled chicken very bland. 

My diet now consists of boiled eggs, veggies of all kinds, oranges, grapes, apples, (all fresh fruit, not canned or cups of fruit as they have lots of sugar). bowl of bran/corn flakes or cheerios, and one time a day I'll have a small burger or something else very small that would also be considered ""bad"" like homemade pasta or a slice of pizza and lots of water to tide me over. 

I know this isn't ideal food to eat at all. But I've still dropped 30 pounds by cutting bad stuff out and eating actual portion sizes and measuring stuff like milk and cereal (no sugary cereal, just bran/corn/cheerios)

I've cut ALL sodas out and ALL snack food/chocolates out. I drink water and eat the above 


Does anyone know if by eating portion sizes, eliminating all sodas and junk food, can I still cure NAFLD? Or is my one slide of pizza/burger ruining it? Does anyone else have any experience?

NAFLD,1jwgb4a,"27M | Elevated LFTs, Fibroscan shows mild fibrosis but no fatty liver—what does it mean?","Hi all, I’m a 27 y/o male, and I’ve been dealing with consistently elevated liver enzymes since my first adult bloodwork in early 2023 (yes, I know that's late). I feel totally healthy and fitter than I’ve ever been (BMI is 21.3, I do HIIT exercise 30 min/day), but my labs and imaging have taken me on a really frustrating journey, and I’m trying to figure out what to make of it now that I finally have some answers from a hepatologist. I’d really appreciate any perspective from folks who’ve been through something similar—or know more than I do about how concerned I should be at this stage.

# My labs (consistently elevated for 2 years):

* **ALT:** Average 88 (most recent: 81)
* **AST:** Average 36 (most recent: 38)
* **ALP:** Average 120 (most recent: 147)
* **GGT:** Average 111 (most recent: 103)
* **Cholesterol:** Borderline at 208 (LDL 122)

My first PCP didn't do anything about this, but my PCP referred me to a gastroenterologist and hepatologist (this took so long to get an appointment, so I saw general GI first). From all those appointments, these have been the results:

* **Ultrasound last year:** Normal liver size and texture; they found a 3–4mm gallbladder polyp which I'm told not to worry about
* **MRI in January:** 3mm gallbladder polyp confirmed and a small 3x4mm hepatic hemangioma, but no real concerns from this
* **Additional bloodwork:**
   * Normal iron, bilirubin, metabolic panel
   * Negative for viral hepatitis, mono, autoimmune markers (ANA, AMA, M2, LKM)
* **Fibroscan recently showed:**
   * Fat score just below the threshold for fatty liver (\~236 dB/m)
   * Hepatologist said there is mild fibrosis, but no cirrhosis
   * He also said there is no clearly identifiable cause of the elevated ALT
* **Thyroid, STI, and additional autoimmune tests** also normal

# My lifestyle for the last 3 years has consistently been:

* **Diet:**
   * I almost never eat breakfast
   * Meal prep healthy lunches (broccoli, rice, chickpeas, sweet potatoes, ground chicken, etc.
   * I eat HelloFresh for dinner 3x/week
   * I go on and off with snacking on processed and sugary foods, this is definitely a weakness of mine
* **Exercise:**
   * 30 mins daily, mostly cardio (Peloton, mountain bike)
   * Occasional strength training
   * Lost 25 lbs post-COVID and have maintained since
* **Alcohol:** Rarely (1–2 drinks/month) but now completely abstinent since Sept 2024 while investigating the liver issues
* **Cannabis:** Longtime daily user. I take breaks every few years. I'm conscious this could play a role in my condition but every doctor has told me it's not a direct cause like alcohol can be.

# My family history:

* **Dad** has fatty liver (NASH), high cholesterol, and multiple sclerosis.
* **Paternal aunt** has primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and some related issues like granuloma tissue development.
* **Maternal grandmother:** Died of pancreatic cancer in mid-80s.

After having the Fibroscan, the hepatologist has advised I re-test in 6 months and if the ALT remains high and Fibroscan doesn't improve, then to consider a biopsy. I REALLY do not want to get a biopsy if it's not necessary. What do you think could be the underlying cause of this based on my profile?",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nafld/comments/1jwgb4a/27m_elevated_lfts_fibroscan_shows_mild_fibrosis/,tibblez_,2025-04-10 20:17:42,1.0,post,,,

NAFLD,1jqx968,Should I be worried?,"Hi everyone,
I’m not sure if I have NAFLD but I’ve been quite nervous about it for a little over a year and I feel like either my anxiety is getting to me thinking doctors are missing something or maybe the doctors aren’t concerned for a reason.

Anyway, my alt/ast was always in the normal range (usually high teens to low twenty’s) and alt was always lower than ast.

Back in December of 2023, I had a blood test that showed my alt at 90 and ast at 45. Totally random, very odd and never was high before. I went for a few blood tests after that to follow up and the numbers came down within a month or so to ALT 32 and AST 25. 

Ever since then, they’ve been around that same range. Never back to low 20’s or high teens.
My ALT is now always a few points higher than my AST (last blood test was yesterday and my ALT was 31 and AST 27.)

I’m 27 y/o female, in shape, bmi is 21, and I eat incredibly healthy. I do have PCOS and my glucose/LDL are always in normal range but borderline. 

I read online (I know I shouldn’t) that liver cancer can have numbers similar to mine and I’m just freaking out a little thinking doctors are dismissing me.
So asking if you guys think it’s something I should push them to look into more or if it’s just me getting myself all riled up for nothing.
 Would also love to hear if anyone has any knowledge from doctors that they’ve heard or anything like that on the matter. Kind of scared over here.

Test results for reference: 

March (2025) ALT: 31, AST: 27
June (2024) ALT: 25, AST: 24
February (2024) ALT: 32, AST: 28
January (2024) ALT: 34*, AST: 26
December (2023) ALT: 90*, AST: 45
June (2023) ALT: 19, AST: 21

* indicates out of range high (range went up to 32)

Bilirubin is always around .3 and albumin was 4.6 on this last one.

I'm not villanizing fruit, far from it - the balance of components within it actually tells an incredible story that validates what I'm talking about.  Unripe, Fibrous, sour fruit are often fat-burning.  This is nearly opposite to ripe, Fructose heavy, juiced or even dried fruits.  In fact this actually mirrors the ripening process and simultaneously matches the preferences of both animal and plant.

What would you consider a ‘good’ macro balance. Or let me simplify that. How many grams of carbs would you stick to on average, or keep as a minimum, whatever? Take any bodyweight for example (if you want) and I’ll do the math.

I know this is a big topic but people rarely talk about it. 

I have multiple digestive issues, also thyroid and some intolerances (eggs/nuts/dairy)so I am struggling atm to make my diet work.

My current diet is worsening my RUQ pain. I blame the saturated fats from 3 meals of (mostly animal source) protein rich foods. Also I think I am too low on carbs. For reference I weigh <210pounds/<95kg. And carb intake is about 80g a day.

Pain could also indicate bile or pancreatic enzyme insufficiency, because I also struggle to metabolize fats (stool). Might consider supplementing. Last option would be Gallstones, but I have no idea if they can form rapidly. My ultrasound in January showed clean Gallbladder.",1.0

Tjankfully my pancreas was fine but my liver isnt. My liver enzymes are normal. I'm much older than you & a Mom. I had my gallbladder removed in 2014 & after that I had recurring pain in the area. For yrs it would come & go & I was told it was a result of the gallbladder removal & not having enough bile to properly digest food. Last yr the pain worsened, so I returned to my gastroenterologist. I also had a deep concern about pancreatic cancer since my father died from it, so I asked for an U/S. My pancreas was fine but diffuse liver steatosis was an accidental finding. I don't drink & never have but I did gain a lot of weight after my husband passed in 2017 & we had a myriad of other issues surrounding that tragic life event. That'll do it. My life completely changed & my daughter & I went from one trauma to the next. I became an emitional eater fir the very first time in my life & gained 50lbs which my body couldnt handle. After the U/S, my Dr ordered an MRI to confirm the U/S diagnosis. It did. Now she is having me do a Fibroscan (liver elastography U/S - different from a regular U/S) to see if/how much scarring, fibrosis there is. Perhaps this was the U/S you had, since your Dr was sure there's just a little bit of fat & it's mostly gone? That's a strong possibility. You shoukd ask your Dr bc that's really significant. 


 I, too, am panic stricken bc I have a hard time losing weight.  I was always healthy & thin my whole life, so my type are the worst dieters since we never had to.it's rough. Even after an 11lb loss, the liver stenosis was there. I do eat very healthy but occasionally crave a snack or two. The one thing I am lacking is physical activity. I fell 9yrs ago & have three torn meniscii in my knees, so I do gentle exercise like yoga & Tai Chi. You're young & have a 90%+ chance of keeping this insidious disease at bay. Watch your diet & dont drink a lot or it coukd turn into alcohol fatty liver disease. Even children as young as eight can get non-alcohilic fatty liver disease from poor diet.

The last couple of years have also been riddled with extreme levels of stress. My sister recently passed away and the first signs of what happened to her was cirrhosis of the liver. 
I felt something was wrong with me mid last year and finally got my doctor to do some blood work. My liver levels and cholesterol were off. 
He informed me that I have the beginning stages of NAFLD and to work on eating healthy and exercising. 
I’ve gotten back into the groove of both. I’m eating multiple greens, healthy fats, lean proteins and hardly any carbs. The carbs i do eat, are more “ancient grain” or sweet potatoes. 

But I’m not losing any weight. I’ve “lost” maybe 1lb and then I’m back up 2lbs. I’m eating significantly less than I was previously and have more exercise in my life. All of my fitness knowledge seems to be going out the window with this diagnosis because nothing seems to be helping me. 
I’ve been told I should try to detox my liver with castor oil packs because my liver may be too angry to process any weight loss? 

Any thoughts/suggestions are appreciated. I’m definitely becoming frustrated and not happy with the amount of effort having a lack of impact. 

Since I can’t seem to edit the top of my post, I’m 31F, 5’11” and sitting at 235lbs. I did a lot of power/weightlifting in the past and for bodybuilding the lowest weight I got to was 160lbs. My body tends to sit around the 180-200lb mark so I’m looking to drop anywhere from 20-35lbs.

He did ask if diabetes runs in my family and it does, on my father’s side. Still no mention of genetic testing and didn’t even test me for diabetes either. 

Then again, I am from the UK (Wales) and my doctor outright told me that the NHS is limiting certain tests because they are so expensive, so maybe that could be why I haven’t been tested.

It's taken a while to adjust to the lack of salt, but I guess I crave salt less now that I've practically removed lots of foods with added salt from my diet (and from my cooking too). Cutting processed meat and fatty cheese was a big help. Essentially once I removed options like that, I found other options to use instead, like heaps of tinned tuna for example (in springwater, not oil).

I still crave those salty foods sometimes of course, but I guess I've learned to do without.

OP, it's generally good to avoid processed foods as much as possible. I might cave and have the occasional bag of crisps, but overall I don't really have packaged savory snacks anymore. To make it easy, I just avoid that entire aisle in the supermarket. I'm sorry I don't have any recomendations because I just don't eat those foods anymore.

It is hard to make a diet change, but from experience I can reassure you that once you start introducing new foods or cuisines or snacks then over time you'll just crave the other ones less because not only will your habits adjust but your tastebuds will also.

NAFLD,1ian9su,Weight Gain,"I have had liver issues for about the past 3 1/2 years now stemming from drinking and eating terribly, and its been an up and down time to say the least. Most of my scans and test have come back as normal or slightly above blood markers with a mild fatty liver in scans. Except for last year around this time where I had an ultrasound scan come back as severe fatty liver with advanced fibrosis, however the scan was right after the holidays in which I had binge drunk and ate whatever I felt like, and my doctors said that my high scan was due to  binging as well as having it done at a newish clinic that he felt hadn't mastered their equipment yet. I had a fibrosis scan later in the summer and It came back as 5.3 KPA or some such to confirm at least the damage was not there. I am about to do another round of scans and tests and I'm nervous, the fibroscan wasn't the kind that showed how fatty the liver was so I haven't had a scan to determine the amount of fat I have on my liver in about a year. For those first few months after the ultrasound scan I was incredibly strict however after the fibroscan I have been slacking A bit. At the very start of of all this I was around 6'2"" 270 plus lbs and since then have gotten as low as 168lbs, when I had the fibroscan done In early June I was approx 175-180lb and am now currently at about 205-210lbs,  a good portion of that gain is muscle but I certainly have gained some fat. My diet is still good compared to the average persons (although I'm eating treats like dark chocolate or frozen yogurt sometimes and too many carbs about 150-200gs/day mostly from cheerios, oatmeal, all-bran the rest fruit and veggies) and I lift 5 days a week and do cardio the other two, but I'm still fretting about stuff. Even though I've asked my doctors, (GP and liver specialist) for example taking creatine and protein powder both said it wouldn't hurt, and I showed them both my nail beds which are fairly white and they both said it wasn't my liver even though it looks similar to terrys nails. My liver doc told me as long as I refrain from drinking ( I haven't since last new years) that I wont need to see him again, however my gain in weight (especially over the holidays my resolve was slipping and I was eating more sugary stuff which i usually try not to)  and nail beds being as white or even whiter are making me nervous that I am screwing up. Do you guys think I am over reacting or what, obviously you can't know/say for sure and only the scans and tests will tell, but based on experience do y'all have any opinions or insight?

MASH,1okros1,Margaret and Frank’s affair,"I grew up watching the series, after having seen the movie and I subsequently read the first book. I don’t remember any TV show airing prior to M*A*S*H that was as open about adultery as M*A*S*H was. I think we fans all take for granted Margaret and Frank’s affair. It’s talked about openly on the show, flaunted for everyone to see, and while the characters make jokes about it, everyone just accepts it as part of the camp’s daily life.  Television in the 1970’s was vastly different from what was shown in the previous decades. The first two and a half decades (commercial TV broadcasts began in 1946) were more conservative and censored. They couldn’t even say the word “pregnant” on I Love Lucy. Rob and Laura Petrie slept in separate beds. Mary Richards couldn’t be divorced; she had to have a broken engagement. A lot of that changed in the 1970’s, with M*A*S*H helping to break new ground. So the fact that two main characters on a show that premiered just two years after The Mary Tyler Moore Show began are shown committing adultery for THE FIRST FOUR SEASONS is actually pretty significant. 

So I was wondering if M*A*S*H was the first TV show to show adultery as merely a font of jokes every week and not something that was cautiously, shamefully whispered about in the shadows, or were there other shows that came before M*A*S*H that were that casual about adultery?  I don’t think even the previous military comedies (The Phil Silvers Show, McHale’s Navy, Gomer Pyle, F Troop* and Hogan’s Heroes) flaunted adultery in the same way that M*A*S*H did. What about the other sitcoms? 

*Jane and Wilton were supposed to be a hands-on couple, but when Ken Berry learned that Melody Patterson was underage (I think she was just 15 when she was cast; she claimed to be 18), he practiced a hands-off approach in every episode. He never touched her and the characters never insinuated that they spent any intimate time together. This was typical of the 1960’s.

MASH,1okros1,Margaret and Frank’s affair,,,,AisalsoCorrect,2025-10-31 06:04:53,,comment,nmd4gw8,"Mash is weird cause it’s a show set both in a very specific time period (the 50’s) and about a very different very specific time period (the 70’s). It’s also a show that starts out based on a movie, based on a book and then grows into its own thing. 

Initially, yes the affair is treated as a joke, but you misunderstand the joke. The joke is not that they’re having an affair. Plenty of characters engage in that. The joke is that they’re both uptight “silent majority” macarthy-ites who are engaging in a pretty open affair, which they nevertheless feel the need to deny. The joke is the hypocrisy. 

This is clear from even their first scene where they’re playing footsie while Frank reads the literal bible. (Funnily enough in that same scene Henry is opening a bottle of champagne with a nurse, this is never addressed again.) 

The way Margaret’s character is treated in the beginning is very much based on the joke of a conservative woman who sleeps around. Later as the show becomes more about the 70’s and 80’s that joke wears out because of changing attitudes and the shows switch to more dramatic themes. Margaret’s character becomes more about the knock on effects of women’s liberation and more generally just a well rounded character.",51.0

Henry slept around. Trapper slept around. Hawkeye, though not an adulterer in the technical sense, definitely got around. But Frank and Margaret were exclusive in their infidelity. Which is what made Margaret’s sudden engagement so devastating. 
As for other shows where adultery is featured, pretty sure Soap did it. Archie Bunker had a fling, though it wasn’t played for laughs.

MASH,1okros1,Margaret and Frank’s affair,,,,elegant-deer19,2025-10-31 06:18:40,,comment,nmd6xrz,"Extramarital affairs in the context of war were often talked about: 

there was a very popular song during WWII “Don’t Sit Under the Apple Tree”, which cautioned girlfriends of soldiers to not play around until “I come marching home.” 

Similarly, WWI had the popular song “the Mademoiselle of Armentieres” about a famous “experienced” woman/prostitute from that French town. Edited to add that this song is quite funny. It’s meant to be funny, not cautionary. 

Soldiers in both wars were cautioned to wear condoms to protect against VD/STDS. It was a huge concern in the army. 

There’s lots of other examples too. 


I think that Margaret and Frank’s affair was meant to highlight their hypocrisy. Frank breaks his marriage vows to Louise repeatedly. But he still maintains that he is morally superior to Trapper and Henry, yet they are on the same playing field. Likewise Margaret thinks she is virtuous yet sleeps with every general that glances in her direction.",9.0

The Burns/Hot Lips relationship (notable that they are both anagonists) breaks up, which leads to Margaret's face turn. There's even a reference early on to Hawkeye being married, which is quickly forgotten. By the time Charles joins the cast the issue of cheating is only raise when it is going to be taken seriously and treated as a very bad thing.

Remember, it wasn't just Frank who was stepping out on his wife - Henry and Trapper were routinely shown as dating various nurses; there was that whole episode in season 2 called Henry in Love, where he becomes infatuated with a girl who is, let's face it, almost young enough to be his daughter. He's obviously banging her, though they didn't actually show that in the episode.

Side note - it's been a very long time since I saw an episode of F-Troop, so I looked it up on IMDB, and holy carp, Ken Berry was 32 in 1965, so even if Melody Patterson had been 18 as she claimed, that's a ridiculous age gap by today's standards.",9.0

There's several episodes of kids coming to the camp. That Kim episode you mentioned, The Chosen People, it seemed every Christmas episode either had an orphanage coming to camp or already there. But I don't think this line from Radar was referring to anything seen previously.

Yes, the tone is quite different, especially compared to the latter seasons of the series. Although set in Korea, the movie was made at the height of the unpopularity of the Vietnam War and that is reflected in the feel of it. 

Trapper, Hawkeye and Duke are not that likable and their treatment of Margaret is pretty schoolyard bully. 

Robert Duval’s Frank Burns is great, a much darker and formidable character than the show’s Frank. 

The film is closer to the novel, although author Richard Hornberger was never a big fan of either the movie or the series. 

Robert Altman had a unique filmmaking style, such as his trademark technique of multiple characters talking at once. He was part of the wave of “New Hollywood” directors in the 60s and 70s who were given greater latitude by studios to make grittier, more subversive movies. MASH to me represents the huge cultural shift of the 1960s as it is a film that was very popular in 1970 that wouldn’t have been made in 1960.

The movie has it's moments, and so does the book even, but the TV show is really where M\*A\*S\*H hit the sweet spot.",2.0
MASH,1ojtjqj,Movie,,,,4personal2,2025-10-30 10:31:39,,comment,nm86r69,"Mistake 1 - Watching the 
movie or reading the book 'Last' : 

Hard to do ,given how much this series plays everywhere. When I started watching in 1978, ironically enough, the movie was shown one evening (during summer break from school). 

I was a touch confused on the more adult things but I got the humor.(Astoundingly they didn't cut the ""shower tent drop ""AT ALL! 😳 

I read the book in my very early teens , before the series reached its end.  It was like I was reading the film's script 'almost'.  

Mistake 2 - Assuming the book or movie would be , in spirit, anything like the series.  

The book came out in1968, the movie in 1970 during the heat of Vietnam, Vietnam protests, other political and civil rights protests and so many more things going on in America. 

The movie , to me, reflects that
era despite being set in 1950 or so.  

When CBS decided to green light a TV series, typical of the times, the 'suits' assumed they'd get a funny but touching ""service comedy"" . 

True that sitcoms by Norman Lear and the people at MTM were changing sitcoms for the good, censors kept a pretty tight reign on what was acceptable.  

MASH ""had to"" be listed as a sitcom,because the term ""dramady"" didn't exist yet. So, in the first 3 seasons, that's what we mostly got and it was done very well. 

Later tough, it had to distance itself from the book and Movie, to be it's own series.",2.0

My wife and I are watching the series from start to finish again. To make it more interesting, we decided to have a scavenger hunt for phrases and idioms that were used in MASH that sound dirty/kinky/risqué today. 

We’ve found a bunch already, but this is one I had to share. It’s from the first episode of season 9, “Best of Enemies.” Winchester tells Col. Potter what he will do after winning the bridge match, and it’s even more disturbing than dancing on someone’s grave.

There are a lot of inconsistencies.  The first time Potter mentions his home, he says it's Nebraska.

Henry's wife was originally named Mildred, then later it was changed to Lorraine.

Sidney was originally called Milton,

Margaret said her father was dead early in the series, but later he stops by for a visit.

Potter's age doesn't make any sense.  At one point he says that he is in his 60s.  But if that were true, then he would have no need to lie about his age to enlist in WW1.

Potter also seems to go from having a son to having a daughter.

In the reunion episode, Klinger reveals that his mother doesn't know he's in Korea.  But up until that point, it seemed pretty clear that she did.

Klinger's family is all kinds of weird, but we can probably write off those inconsistencies as him making things up as part of a scheme to try and get sent home,

This topic alone, Hawkeye has mentioned Maine, Vermont, and even Detroit. 

At one point he lived in Vermont. Then it became that Maine was where the family had a summer home at Crabapple Cove (which implies the family had enough money to do that- later he implies that the family did not). Then he was raised there.  At another episode it is implied he and his father live together. 

At the beginning, he lives with his mother, father, and sister (a sister that later never existed as he was an only child, and a mother who died when he was a child) . Then it’s just his father. He’s mentioned having a practice, but also that he came straight from residency. Residency was said to be in Boston, and another time implied that it was New York. If that’s the case, then where did he live? Surely not in Maine, hours away.

MASH,1oiv6ls,Continuity Error...COL Potter's age.,"I was watching several episodes of M\*A\*S\*H today and came across yet another continuity error from the creators.  It involves COL Potter's age...

At the beginning of Season 4 in Episode 2 (set in 1952) COL Potter joins the 4077th permanently as its CO.  As Radar is helping COL Potter unbox his things in his office, they come across the Good Conduct Medal w/Clasp COL Potter received during WWI.  He states (paraphrased), ""I was 15...lied about my age...had big thighs.""

Later on in the series, there's an episode where COL Potter gets shaky hands because Pierce had to operate on one of COL Potter's patients to remove additional shrapnel.  Sidney Freedman is a central character in this episode, and when he talks to Potter about the issue, he asks the COL how old he is.  COL Potter emphatically states, ""62"".  Let's assume this episode (S10.E15) is set in 1953...Korean war was 1950-1953.

OK...let's do some math!!!

If COL Potter was 15 years old right when America joined the war in 1917, that would mean COL Potter was born in 1902.  If we fast forward to the episode above that takes place in 1953, there is no way COL Potter should have stated he was 62.

1953 - 1902 = 51

Harry Morgan was in fact 67 at the time this episode was originally aired, as he was born in 1915.

As I watch this series over and over and over, I just shake my head at the GLARING continuity errors the creators of the show left in without ZERO attention to detail.  Yeah...it's nit-picking, but c'mon!

Love the series regardless...TIMELESS comedy! :-)",21.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mash/comments/1oiv6ls/continuity_errorcol_potters_age/,SavingsPirate4495,2025-10-28 21:22:07,43.0,post,,,

You’re definitely right, Potter’s age is all over the place, ranging from early 50s to mid 60s depending on the episode. 

There are bigger timeline continuity errors in the series such as the Season Four episode “Deluge” in which it’s announced the Chinese just crossed the border with 300,000 troops officially entering the war on the side of North Korea. That is a real event that occurred in October of 1950, only three months after the war began. By that episode Col. Potter has already taken command which was supposed to have happened in September of 1952. 

I just chalk it up to the writers interjecting a significant real world event to add tension and drama to the show and I let go of the continuity logic.",37.0

The only time they cared about something that happened in the past is if it was important to that weeks story.

And they could get away with it.   The only time we could ever watch a show in order in the 70's and early 80's was when it first ran.   Reruns were played randomly.

It wasn't till cable became widespread and small cable channels played reruns like their main programming that they started showing programs in order on a daily basis.

Take for example, “A War for All Seasons”, which has Potter as the CO in December 1950, nearly two years before he supposedly showed up to take command. I love the episode and it’s pretty obvious that someone wanted to work the Giants coming from behind to win the NL pennant on October 3, 1951 into the series, and didn’t care that it messed with the “official” timeline. So I don’t care, either. I just enjoy the episode. 

I like the suggestion from someone that the series can be viewed as an elderly Hawkeye’s recollections of his time serving in Korea, and because he’s gotten older, his memory isn’t as good as it used to be, so he mixes up some of the people and events of that time in his life. This would explain all the mistakes and the fact that we see the same people play different characters. In his mind, he might remember a certain person but not exactly how they looked, so he substitutes someone else for that person. He also relies on the memories of some of the people he served with to fill in some of the gaps, since he wasn’t there for absolutely everything that happened.",5.0

MASH,1ogxzu4,Thinking about…,,,,Imaginary_Floor6432,2025-10-26 15:54:44,,comment,nlk3pug,"There use to be a magazine called TV Guide.  Much like the guide channel, it had the listing of the shows on TV for the week, and some sort of synopsis of what the episode was about.  Much like what we see in streaming service today.  Sometimes it was a sentence or two.  If the show would do a big “very special” episode/season premiere, there could be a whole article with interviews.  
In its initial run, M*A*S*H (I believe - some one will correct me if I’m wrong) ran after 8 o’clock.  That time slot was for “serious TV” cause the children would be in bed.  So they could do more adult comedy and such.  Dinner time (like 5-6) was for the family friendly/light hearted shows (like Happy Days).
So, definitely still a chance of someone hoping for comedy but getting drama, but also that’s life?  And to me, that’s kind of the point.",8.0

MASH,1ofz24w,"Thoughts about Goodbye, Farewell and Amen","I just finished re-watching all of MASH on Hulu.  (They have (IMO) a very impressive wide-screen conversion of the show.)

Throughout my re-watch, I was surprised by the number of episodes I do NOT recall seeing before - back in the day, I watched so many MASH re-runs on our local UHF station, I was sure I must have seen them all.  The final episode hit me just as hard as when it originally aired, particularly the last 10 minutes or so as everyone is saying their last goodbyes.   I also liked this symmetry: every episode begins (i.e. the opening titles) with choppers coming in for a landing; and the very LAST shot of the whole series is of a chopper flying away, taking Hawkeye home.  

What follows below is not meant as criticism, just an oddity I noticed.   (Just in case anyone’s reading who hasn’t seen the finale - spoilers ahead.).  

The ep starts at a mental clinic where we find Hawkeye an involuntary patient.  (A brief digression: the FIRST time I watched the finale those initial scenes briefly made me think we had jumped forward in time, and that we were seeing a ***post-war*** **Hawkeye** committed to a **state-side** mental hospital.  I thought perhaps Pierce had some kind of mental breakdown **after** being sent home - from PTSD maybe.  That COULD have worked - we could have seen the final days of the 4077th in a series of flashbacks as Hawkeye described them to Sidney - but I was kind of relieved when that wasn’t it.  Anyway...)

In a small room, Sidney prompts Hawkeye: “Yesterday you were going to tell me about that day at the beach.”   A little reluctantly, Hawkeye describes the beach outing, and in flashbacks we see Mulcahey, Hunnicut, Klinger, Soon Lee, nurse Kellye and others enjoying themselves.  

Next, Sidney asks Hawkeye about the ride back to camp, bringing us the first ""party-bus"" version of the ride home.  (We also see that Margaret is among the partygoers, though I don’t recall seeing her in the beach sequence).

**This is important**:  *everything that REALLY happened on that bus was witnessed by* ***a couple of dozen people***, including most of the show’s core characters.

At the clinic, Sidney and Hawkeye are interrupted when a phone call comes in for Hawkeye.  Potter, Hunnicut, Mulcahey, Klinger and Houlihan, all take the phone and awkwardly wish him well.  Hawkeye irritably demands they get him released, and while his colleagues are sympathetic , they are obviously not planning to get him an immediate release.  They seem baffled and worried by Hawkeye’s predicament, yet hopeful that Sidney can help him.  **It’s the “baffled” part that struck me as odd**.   Moving on…

Sidney eventually helps Hawkeye remember the terrible truth about that night;  that the bus picked up some Korean refugees, plus a group of American GIs, including some injured - and that the they had to hide the whole bus from an enemy patrol, staying silent to avoid detection.   To his horror, Hawkeye remembers the awful moment he’d suppressed:  a Korean woman on the bus had suffocated her own baby after Hawkeye hissed at her to keep him quiet, lest they all be discovered.  

Sidney brought Hawkeye to this moment in his usual, breadcrumb-following way: he pays close attention to Hawkeye’s word-choices, what things he seems purposefully vague about, and what mundane questions provoke his anger.  

My point here is:  Sidney ***could*** have been far more direct **if he’d known in advance** what was probably bothering Hawkeye.  It seems clear to me that **Sidney DID NOT know about what happened on the bus UNTIL he finally got it out of Hawkeye.**   

And that, I think, is the odd thing:   **WHY?**

Try to imagine Potter calling Sidney and saying “Sidney, I think Pierce needs your help.  He’s acting very strangely - yes, more than usual…”.   Yet **NOT** adding:  “He hasn’t been the same since a trip to the beach a couple of weeks ago.  You see, there was a really terrible incident on the ride home….”  and filling in the details.  

I really feel like **somebody** \- if not Potter, one of the others - would TELL Sidney about the bus incident when they first reached out to him regarding Hawkeye’s erratic behavior.  It’s exactly the kind of shocking, sickening moment that would haunt ANYONE for a long time -  particularly in the days and weeks right after it happened.  

Indeed, it’s arguably a *little* strange that, for the entire rest of the episode, nobody else even mentions the bus incident.  Granted, it’s not the kind of thing they would want to reminisce about, but considering Hawkeye’s difficulties it’s hard to believe none would ever suspect a connection.   Heck, if I were Sidney, whenever (and however) I heard about the bus incident, I would be concerned about the possibility that the OTHERS on that bus might also be struggling to come to terms with it.

Again though, **my fondness for MASH and the finale in particular are in no way diminished by these observations**, I’ll give it a complete pass.   Still it’s something that occurred to me on a second viewing (separated from my first viewing by 40 years…)",34.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mash/comments/1ofz24w/thoughts_about_goodbye_farewell_and_amen/,Beady_El,2025-10-25 11:35:58,33.0,post,,,

They've all seen death, live with it, eat waiting for it, sleep dreading it. For Pierce, he feels directly responsible. For Margaret? It was awful. Pierce doesn't break down over the dog she was secretly feeding, for example. For Potter? It was a Korean doing what she needed to survive; he's seen enough desperation in times of war to know it's a terrible business and his out is like BJ's; his wife.

I watch MASH as the story of Hawkeye gradually losing his mind; he fights against it, tries to retain his humanity, but the final is the culmination point for him. He feels like he's killed. Not the war, not the woman, that baby's life was his and he ended it to save everyone else.",18.0

I think that's why it was presented as it was - in flashback with a ""chicken"" instead of in real time. I think that may be why they wouldn't have others discuss it on-screen - anything that was said would tend to focus attention on Hawkeye's behavior, and they didn't want that.

MASH,1ofiyp9,Couple of familiar faces spotted in the wild,"I recently bought Kolchak: The Night Stalker (a one-and-done series from the 1974-75 TV season about a journalist in Chicago who investigates strange, oftem supernatural/paranormal cases) on DVD and recognized a couple of guest stars from the 4077. Jamie Farr appeared in episode 13 (out of 20) as a high school biology teacher who provides insight on a case involving a reanimated prehistoric creatire and Larry Linville showed up a couple episodes later as a newly-promoted police captain who is overseeing the investigation of bikers who are being murdered by a ghostly former member of their gang. Both episodes aired in January of 1975.

The producers of MASH knew of Bill Christopher, and thought he'd be good to replace George Morgan Not that the producers disliked George. They just wanted more 'natural accentricity', as Larry Gelbart said it, later. But when they called Bill in, he totally ab-libbed his audition. It's known that Gelbart hated improv over what was scripted, and actors always stuck to the written words on MASH. 

So Bill went home, and somebody (Burt Metcalfe, maybe) got hold of Bill's agent and said, uhh, your client pretty much blew it. But tell him if he comes back and Sticks To The Script, we'll have him back. Bill came back and re-auditioned, and the rest is history!",9.0

MASH,1oeclpv,Should BJ have told his wife?,"I think Hawkeye did the right thing, throwing that letter in the stove. Honesty is important in a marriage, but there's also tact. You don't say everything out loud, just because it's honest, when it's only going to cause problems. Adultery can lead to divorce, and BJ is a good person; he doesn't deserve to have that happen to him. And more than that, his wife doesn't deserve what he's going to put her through. However much anguish he's feeling over the adultery is nothing compared to what she will go through, as she agonizes over the decision to leave him or not. And things will never be the same between them. It can't even be called an affair, as that implies an extended on-going sexual liaison. Of course, some people here seem to think he's feeling guilty over just a kiss on the lips.

MASH,1oeclpv,Should BJ have told his wife?,,,,OldTell311,2025-10-23 13:07:37,,comment,nl0mdig,"Yes I remember thinking Hawkeye was being a good friend there. BJ clearly loved Peg madly and he was torturing himself for betraying her. So much so he wasn’t thinking clearly. He wanted to absolve his conscience by coming clean but he wasn’t thinking how that would mean Peg would now have to bear the burden of his failure as well. 

BJ wasn’t Henry Blake or Trapper or Frank who happily carried on affairs with no real remorse or desire to repent. Hawkeye knew BJ wouldn’t become a serial philanderer and would never want to feel that guilt again. We see this later when Maggie O’Shea presents BJ with a very tempting offer of a love affair and this time his loyalty to Peg and his family reasserts itself. He learned his lesson and stayed true to his resolve to never do it again. 

The later seasons show the consequences of the infidelity that was treated lightheartedly early on. We see BJ’s guilt and torment, and we see the perspective of the nurse whom he spent the night with and how she was impacted too. In the end Hawkeye was not telling BJ that his slip was OK, but that he’s still a good man, husband and father and not to also punish Peg and Erin for a one-time mistake that he clearly regrets.",24.0

Ozempic,1oksdvj,What is considered a plateau?,"I started on Ozempic 11 weeks ago at 78,8 kg (29,7 BMI), I’m a type 1 diabetic and wanted more control over my BG (it helped a lot for that) and to lose weight and could never manage to lose weight long term because I was literally ALWAYS hungry. I did 4 weeks of 0,25 and have been on 0,50 for the last 7 weeks. After some really fast weight loss the first weeks it slowed down to 200-300 grams a week which is fine by me (I’m at 72,6 kg now). However I do notice a bit more hunger / food noise the last two weeks and I actually gained a little bit last week (and I know this could also be natural weight fluctuations) but it is the first time in 11 weeks my weight wasn’t down a little bit and the week before that I was down only 100 grams. Is this considered a plateau or do I need to be the same weight/gaining for a longer period of time? And is is maybe time to up my dose? I have to pay for it myself so I don’t want to up my dose if I don’t have to. But the gaining combined with a slight increase in hunger might be a sign. 

Extra information: I’m fairly active (walking, biking) and I eat healthy most of the time (much easier now I don’t suddenly feel the urge to binge). 

Do I need to up my dose next week or wait a bit? And if I need to up it is it a good idea to not go from 0,5 to 1 but maybe a smaller increase?

Ozempic,1oksdvj,What is considered a plateau?,,,,cleverfox2001,2025-10-31 11:42:16,,comment,nmezay7,"0.25 and 0.5 are introductory doses.  Most need to move up in dose in order to continue losing weight.   The key weight reduction doses are 1.0 and higher.  Many consider a plateau as 4 to 6 weeks with no losses while at 1.0 or higher.

If you want to go up slower, you may find that 0.75 might work for a few weeks.  Then you need to move to 1.0.",2.0

Your brain does need carbs to function. So if you are completely cutting them out ur brain might be saying hey I need some carbs to function properly give me sugar bc that is what it associates it with. Same as when a woman menstruates and craves chocolates . It’s ur brain telling u your body needs folic acid and it associates it with chocolates.

\-in what ways has your face changed? **it has definitely thinned out in a good way!**

\-has losing weight helped with depression/anxiety? **Not the Ozempic directly but exercising more has definitely helped.  I am also on a healthy dose of Wellbutrin for the winter scaries.**

\-do you REALLY feel better about yourself? **1000000% I feel better and look better (I am down 50lbs)**

\-what are you doing to get rid of loose skin? **I didn't have too many issues with this as I wasn't super overweight.  Exercise and eating well helps for sure. I've been doing pilates/walking but should be adding weight training.**

\-what was your starting weight and your weight now? 200lbs ish and now I am at 149

\-if you have thicker thighs and a big butt, do they sag? Or breasts, do they become smaller or sag? If so what have you done to fix/help it? **This question is where my only negatives come in.  I didn't do as much weight lifting as I should have and now my butt is flat.  My boobs are also a lot less full (I am also 40 so expected).  To be honest though, I would 100% do this again knowing my outcomes. Being a healthy weight has changed everything for me.  I would highly recommend ensuring you track your calories, eat a ton of protein and weight lift often to slow down some of the negatives.  Good luck!**",2.0

The doctor thinks it's caused by my PCOS as to why it took so long for it to work for me.

Also my wife is on it too but at .25 mg and has lost so much weight too 25 pounds and has only been on it for 5 weeks. But she has always had and easier time losing than I have.

My hard work at creating exercise routine and taking care of our nutrition and teaching us both moderation is really paying off.

I am nervous about what I'll look like after I lose more weight. Not because I'm insecure about my looks but because I don't know what I look like with out a round face and double chin. Will it be like looking at a stranger in the mirror? Will it take awhile to adjust to my true facial features?

Health care professionals around here say the safe max amount for a person closer to normal BMI is around 9lbs per month. Instead of gaining more steam it should slow down a bit to keep it safe and not lose all your muscle tissue and risk all the other complications that come with very rapid weight loss.

Think of it in this way: the higher amount you need to lose the longer you need to run, not faster. Just keep at it and you'll get there. 

On when you start noticing weight loss in the mirror - my personal guesstimation is that until you're under 30 BMI you need to lose about 10% of your body weight from your chosen comparison point to see clear change in the mirror. Clothes are much more sensitive indicator fortunately :)",3.0

As you get closer to 100s, you'll also gain some inches in height! That happens to most people that are extremely overweight, all the extra weight pushes you down, without it you'll get a few inches back in height

My weight has been pretty much the same from start to now. However, my body comp has changed. 

I have been doing HIIT, MMA, and weightlifting for now.. 15 years? So, my overall bodyweight tends to stay the same while my body comp shifts to be leaner especially when I'm in a ""cutting"" phase. 

Ended up on blood pressure meds about 4 years ago. 

Started Ozempic (due to diabetes) a year after that. 

A1C went from 6.9 to 5.6 while on Ozempic plus metformin. Mounjaro dropped it to 5.1 and off my blood pressure meds and off metformin. 

I found it easier to lean out while on a GLP than without. 

Cutting additional fat beyond my current body fat percentage of 28% requires me to be extra strict. However, I'm happy where I am because I perform better in the gym. 

Total pounds lost? Like 8lbs lol. But, my body fat went from 36% to 28%. I'll happily take my shots to manage my A1C as that was always the goal for me to avoid other health issues.",2.0

Ozempic,1ok0he4,"First four weeks down, not feeling side effects ?","Morning everyone, 

I just had my fifth dose, increased to 0.5. 

The first shot - had very mild side effects the day after the first dose.

Felt super full at dinner time so I was oh, this is how it works and assumed it would heighten as my dosage increased. 

The feeling full went away after 2 weeks, and third week, felt like I wasn’t even taking the shot. 

I just started the 0.5 dose and feel the exact same. No side effects, not even on day two.  Feel kind of full, but not really. 

No weightloss yet. No weight gain either 

Has the food noise decreased: 1000% 

I’m insulin resistant, and a lot of foods make me feel bloated and inflamed and I’m shocked that I’ve been able to have pasta and not feel like shit.  The shot has 1000% helped with the inflammation from IR and in these few short weeks, made me feel human again.  

I eat fairly well. 90% is just meat, veggies and fruit cooked from fresh.  Pasta, Rice, bread - only 2-3x a month or less.  

But everyone talks about the feeling full, being nauseous, all the time.  Maybe I will feel like eventually? I just thought the 0.5 dose would change that.  It’s not that I want to feel like crap, I’m just curious to why I don’t. 

I also don’t keep my pen in the fridge after the first dose….  I’m still working off the first pen and have one more dose left before I have to get a refill.   They say this is okay, but I’m wondering if it’s not and ruined the dosage since I’m not feeling it. 

But maybe some of you had similar experience.

1: Zero appetite at all
2: Easily nauseous ( you can’t eat chips without wanting to throw it up)

Ozempic,1ojnc63,Ozempic and Medicare?,"For anyone on Medicare, did you have to jump through any special hoops to get it covered? 

I know that it isn't covered for weight management, but as I joke, I had the foresight to develop type 2 diabetes a few years ago, which was why it was such a good choice for me (100 pounds lost, A1C from 6.8 to 5.3).  

I'll likely be on Medicare in about a year, and will need to pick a drug plan carefully. So far, looking at the Medicare site, all the plans available to me appear to cover it (but most do NOT cover some fairly cheap generic meds I take, which is odd). What they do NOT indicate is whether any kind of authorization is required, or how much they might stonewall me. And of course I worry that someone might look at my A1C and say I didn't need it (it's that low BECAUSE of the Ozempic, dumbass!!).  

Also, with the weight loss, it's possible my A1C would be good even if I stopped the Ozempic - though I'm one of those who would almost certainly regain when I stop, as I have not been able to make the lifestyle changes for a number of reasons.

He didn't have to do anything special to get it, but you do need to pick the right Part D plan. So he's on a plan that has a pricier premium, about $93 a month, but after the deductible (a few hundred if I remember correctly), it is completely covered. Compare that to a $0 premium plan I have, because I don't have a pricey medication. Note also that part D plans change every year. The best thing you can do is find yourself an insurance agent who will help you with this. They get paid from the health insurance companies. You pay them nothing. You should start getting solicitations from them when you turn 63 or 64, things in the mail, invitations to presentations etc. You will meet with them, give them your list of medications and they will magically find the best plan for you. Doing the math, paying $93 a month plus whatever that deductible totaled for the year was far cheaper for us than going to some lower premium plans that would require a high copay for Ozempic. But you'll likely have to change plans every year to chase the best deal. 

Also note that once you're diabetic, the medical community considers you diabetic forever, regardless of what your current low A1C is. Like you said that's the point! Smart of you to think ahead. The only thing you need to do now is wait for the invitations to come in and find yourself a local reputable health insurance agent who will walk you through this.",3.0

No matter how much I eat I stay hungry, even when my stomach is full and I'm getting bumps.  The hunger feeling never ever goes away at all. When I'm eating, after I've eaten. It's been constant 100% of the time. Its driving me nuts. 
The first week I still was a bit hungry but my cravings were all gone and I lost a few pounds. Since a few days and now after the second dose im ravenous all the time. I've never been this hungry in my life and I've got to force myself to overeat what i feel like eating and then still it's not enough. I'm also taking extra protein in low sugar no fat protein shakes. I'm eating whole weat everything, protein, fiber, vegetables and drinking plenty of water. But I'm just getting hungrier and hungrier. Normally I would be a bit hungry sometimes but the issue was sugar cravings and binge eating. That's gone so I dont do that anymore but it's been replaced by a never ending hunger.

Or starting to digest shortly after a meal reads as hunger to me (bc again, I go from super full to... normal). But I just have to ride it out.

Also needing to switch from regular meals (3x a day or whatever) to super frequent snacking is totally normal on Ozempic.

That being said, if you've just started the medication, you're going to go through a lot of changes and different feelings. You're on a starting dose so ride it out and talk to your doctor.

Ozempic,1ojsc7a,Vent/Help perhaps ?,"So I have been taking ozempic for a few months. Since mid/end ish July. I started at 260 now I am at 235. Still not my goal weight but I’m working on it. I been eating less and eating healthier I would say, as for exercise my schedule is horrid so I fear I barely have enough time but I have to make it work eventually.

Anywho…I’m taking 2 mg, I been taking 2 mg for a few weeks. No side effects I believe except the usual nausea and appetite loss. (Also idk wtf happened last week but when I ate a meal it literally made me puke it out the NEXT day family guy style it was honestly traumatizing—not to mention the diarrhea 😭😭)

I have for the past week noticed that my shoulders, sides and chest hurt. Not sure if it’s lack of exercise or if it’s ozempic related but it triggers my anxiety a bit. I’ve also noticed that sometimes one of my ears would suddenly muffle for a second or two. Also being tongue tied more often, but tbf as yall can see I am a yapper.
My blood sugar levels are seemingly normal to the point where I genuinely don’t believe I’m diabetic (but we will find out soon and if I’m no longer diabetic then goodbye ozempic) but these feelings concern me. I was wondering if anyone here has had a similar experience or know if it has anything to do with the medication.

I will consult my doctor tomorrow this is kinda like a late night vent/question because why not

Ozempic,1oicxgs,free Ozempic tracker for daily use,"There are dozens of Ozempic or Wegovy apps out there that were built by tech folks who've never actually been on the GLP-1. They see what's working well, like Shotsy, copy features and rush to reddit hoping to make quick money.

This app is built in our free time by two users (yep, both of us on the meds!) who love creating useful tools. We believe everyone should have a free app to track GLP-1 basics.

Glapp tracker is 100% free and community-driven. What does it mean? You can use the tracker completely free and suggest features you personally miss. When a request comes up multiple times, we develop and add it to the app. This approach is simple and incredibly powerful.

For example, one of the most requested features was a weekly recap that actually analyzes what worked and what didn't - not just weight changes, but patterns like when side effects appear or how your progress compares to others who started at a similar point. The report is already live and 98% of users love it.

Why am I writing this post?

\* We’d love your input on what to build next.  
\* The more people log, the smarter it gets like better pattern insights and better comparisons.  
\* We built the tracker for real people on GLP-1 so dive in and enjoy the app!

you can try it out here: [glapp.io](http://glapp.io/)

Everything you see now will stay free forever. If we add premium features down the road to cover server costs, the core tracking you rely on won't change. 

Glapp is also webapp, which keeps things simple - you can use it on your desktop, Iphone or Android. You can add it to your screen and use it like regular app. 

Try it, see what feels useful and drop your thoughts in the comments. Thanks!",49.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oicxgs,FormerlyObeseJ,2025-10-28 08:46:24,9.0,post,,,

Ozempic,1oii7cd,Cheating,"Hey and lol sorry, the title might seem like a rage bait.

I am still in pretty much the beginning of my journey as I have been on 1mg just for couple of weeks.

I started with 0.25mg about 8 weeks ago and I have lost 6kg (13lbs.)

I never thought I would try ozempic but after struggling with infertility for some years I thought before going to any type of treatments I want to get my BMI from obese to normal weight. I am now down to being ”just”overweight, yay.

Anyway. I thought I would lose weight much faster. I thought by this time I wouldve lost at least 20lbs. I thought I wouldn’t ever be hungry and that I would need to remind myself to eat. None of that is true for me lol.

For me to lose weight on ozempic, I still require a lot of disclipine. I still track my calories and there are days I could easily eat up to my maintenance (or way more even.) Somedays are easier some days are harder.

I guess what I am trying to say is that once I do reach my goal, I can imagine some people viewing it only due to ozempic and that I cheated, even though I have put exactly the same type of effort as I have in my previous weightloss journeys.

The only difference with ozempic is that it clearly normalizes my blood sugar but also it prevents me from having a disorder rlship with food. Before on my weightloss journeys I would lose weight only if I was obsessed by losing weight. I would walk 15-20k steps a day and might even do one more walk if I ”overate” few hundred calories. I would go to sleep early STARVING just so I can wake up early to eat. Food was in my mind 24/7. Thats the only way I could do it. That led me to over do it and the minute I stopped obsessing I would gain weight.

Now, I can do it with a healthy mindset. I dont have rigid step goals. I think about food and get hungry but I am not obsessed by food. I lose weight slowly but steady.

If everything goes according to plan I will still use three pens after this one is finished. After that I will do a reverse diet and body recomp. I am so excited about everything that is ahead as this year I had to stop going to the gym because it made me over eat and struggled with losing weight. I know gym is good no matter what but for me its important to get my bmi to healthy. Now I have reintroduced that again in my life also thanks to ozempic.

But yes, other can view this as cheating but I dont care. I have put in a lot of work to this process. 🥰",13.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1oii7cd/cheating/,Mitapskaaa,2025-10-28 12:01:44,20.0,post,,,

The first 4 weeks were great I noticed changes quite quickly and lost a bit of weight but now I feel like my body isn’t progressing as quickly as I thought it would. I keep looking in the mirror and seeing the same size and it gets me really discouraged. Has anyone else been through this? Someone said I just have to be patient and keep taking the doses so I’m trying to not let it bother me. I’d appreciate any answers or encouragement, thank you :) ",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1oiu0nv/feeling_a_plateau_on_my_journey_with_ozempic/,CommunicationMuch962,2025-10-28 20:20:08,2.0,post,,,

If you're not comfortable with a scale, you can always use measurements to track progress. Losing .5 to 1 lbs per week is still great progress! Also, you're not on the max dose yet. You can always titrate up if you've truly stalled.",4.0

Are you tracking calories, exercise? It's not a magical drug, you still need to work for it. Use it as an opportunity to create a healthy lifestyle, and the weight will follow.",2.0
Ozempic,1oiecqy,I just need to rant,"I just want to preface by saying ozempic is doing its job. I have been on it for 3 months and it's been night and day in terms of food noise - I used to think about food CONSTANTLY and it was ruining my mental health. Since then, I barely think about food. So that in and of itself has been so nice its pretty much *almost* worth it. 

However, the weight loss has been pretty abysmal despite me barely eating, especially over the last 2 weeks. I've lost less than 10lbs total and have teetered between 179 and 184 for the last 2 months. I haven't been tracking my calories, because in the past that has always put me back into binge eating disorder, but I think I might have to start to really see what's going on. Last week there was a period of 48 hours I went without eating (not trying to restrict, just genuinely was not hungry and couldn't get myself to eat). Yesterday, I didn't eat all day except for a Danish I had at 10pm (I know not a healthy choice but calories wise still very low for an entire day). Most days I eat 2-3 small meals (a sandwich, a bowl of soup, etc) and i havent felt hungry in a very long time. This morning I woke up and I'm back to 182. 

It's driving me literally insane. I pay $274/month since it's not covered, and while the absence of food noise has been absolutely incredible, I feel like I'm not paying this much to see no results either. I don't even know what to do because I've tried basically everything in the past - I tried eating more, eating less, working out more etc. The math isn't mathing. Also, I really don't think I'm in ""starvation mode"" as it takes a very long prolonged period (and lower body fat% to get there). The problem isn't the ozempic or any other reason aside from my body is being a f*cking ahole. 

So yeah, I'm going to have to start watching extremely closely and tracking calories because this just doesn't make sense, it is literally defying physics. I think this just goes to prove that weight loss is a lot more complicated than just CICO. While CICO is the most important factor, it's clearly not the only factor AND it's not an exact science like so many want to believe.

Studies show that you will eat less and lose more on these doses.  In fact, most of the weight lost is at doses 1.0 and higher.

You seem to have made an assumption that Ozempic will not work for you.  However, you are not following the standard dosing schedule.  And, most users do better with a high protein diet with low carbs and sugar.  I found that carbs and sugar were my Kryptonite.  I cut those and a year later down 50 pounds.  Also, exercise is good.  Even walking helps.  Some strength training is great as it will help preserve/increase muscle mass.

I work in construction (office only since 2017), and before that my diet was insane. I was eating 4-5 meals a day, working double shifts 7 AM to 1 AM, and I think it may have contributed to basically my inner system being nuked.

I eat a lot less since 2017, only 3 meals a day, timed at 8-10 AM for breakfast 1-2 PM for lunch, and 7-8 PM for dinner. I have to eat in this time frame otherwise I begin to get shaky and get headaches. 

I had my primary doctor check my diabetes and the thing came back not diabetic (i forget the test name and numbers). I went from medium shirt to now XL and my stomach has ballooned. Also, since then I have been losing an insane amount of body hair. I suspect my testosterone levels are down and an in-depth test is pending. My last few tests show normal everything.

I am petrified. I told my doctor I want to get ozempic to control this weight gain. I am 5’11 280 pounds now. I have sleep apnea because my esophagus is literally pinched due to neck fat. I lost all of my confidence. 

I tore my Achilles tendon in 2018 and had surgery in May of 2025. I suffered a lot because i thought feet pain was a result of my fat. I am an idiot i know.

I see success stories here and I wonder, if I get my weight to 180-200/220 - can I stop? I plan on working out - already eat healthierish, and plan on going health crazy. I need to discipline myself.

It will reduce your hunger and you feel fuller quicker but if you get shaky after not eating for a while, that probably won't matter. It will likely change what you eat, for example if you eat high fat foods, you will probably have a bad time. It doesn't make you burn extra calories. To be successful in keeping the weight down and off, you have to modify what and how you eat, even after you stop taking it. You have to change your lifestyle permanently and Ozempic will help you do that but you have to put in some effort also. Eating ""healtherish"" means different things to different people. Like I said you will feel fuller quicker so you need to stop thinking of food as a way to not feel hungry and look at it as nutrition. Find the foods that will give you the most nutrition in the smallest amounts and not empty calories that don't benefit your health. Pretty much if it comes in a box or a can, it probably isn't good for you. Also, the Doctor will probably ask if you have a goal weight and it is Okay to have one but just tell them you don't, you just want to get healthy. A lot of Doctors won't prescribe it if they think you are taking it for vanity or are just looking for a no effort way to lose weight.

With the other health benefits from it, my fairly simple plan is to stay on it at a reasonably low dose, until new things come along.

One easy way to justify the cost is the savings in food. Not only do I just eat the cost of oz less, but I also tend to not buy the more expensive junky things.

More fruit, oatmeal, basic meats, etc. 

Way fewer restaurants.

As a Canadian, you can now get wagovy. It costs twice as much per pen, but you get a bit more than twice as much of the drug.",6.0

Ozempic,1oidi5m,Why do you track your GLP-1 journey? Curious about your motivation!,"Hey everyone! 👋

I’ve been thinking about why many GLP-1 users track their treatment — for example, logging shots, injection sites and there are quite lots of discussion and posts about different tools, methods and features :) 

It’s easy to assume we track just because the app/tool exists, but I’m genuinely curious about your motivation behind tracking.

I’d love to hear from you all:

* What motivated you to start tracking?
* At what point did you start looking for a tracking tool?
* How do you use your tracking data — to make decisions, stay motivated, or something else?

I daily track my weight every morning because it’s a nice reminder that weight fluctuates depending on where I am in my cycle and also if I eat “too much” then I can see that the scale isn’t a bad thing the next day.

Congratulations on taking this big first step!
Remember that this whole process is a marathon and not a sprint. 

I'll offer some advice to help you on your journey that I've given countless people in my time in this group and my time on ozempic/wegovy. 

First of all, don't expect miracle results overnight. Not everyone has the same timeline of results. Some people see results ""overnight"" with .25, some people don't see results until 1.0 or higher. 

Next, the recommended dosing guidelines for ozempic are a minimum of 4 weeks at each dose of .25, .5, 1.0, and 2.0 according to the official ozempic website and information. I *strongly* recommend you only increase by .25 at a time (.25, .5, .75, 1.0, 1.25, etc), you can find click charts online for your specific pen size to customize the dose (for example, each increment of .25 on a 1.0 dosing pen is 18 clicks). Stay on each dose a *MINIMUM* of 4 weeks. If the dose is still giving you good results after 4 weeks, stay on the dose. Filling those two guidelines will maximize the overall effectiveness of ozempic over time as well as minimize any potential for side effects. Only increase to the next dose when the current one loses effectiveness.

You need to follow the titration schedule or you risk more serious side effects, that's why the schedule exists in the first place. 

Also when doing your injection (usually belly, but some people do thigh), make sure your pinching the skin a good amount of the 'fatty' tissue and injecting into that area, and holding the needle there after your injection finishes clicking down for an extra count of at least 5 seconds (to make sure all of the medication was dispensed)

Thirdly: figure out your BMR and TDEE, you can Google a calculator to do that online and it will give you that right amount of calories to safely consume in order to lose weight while still getting adequate nutrition and the calories needed to survive. 

Also, you need to track your food and keep count of the calories of what you eat to stay in that range. I recommend finding a good app that you like. Personally, my favorite is loseit, but there are many great options out there. Tracking your food and staying in the calorie deficit is a key to success.

Try to prioritize protein and fiber as much as you can within your meals. There are a lot of great and creative ways to add them into your diet. When you don't feel like eating a protein shake is a great way to get some calories and protein in. There are always powders, and for premades, I find fairlife and Premier protein to be the best. As far as powders, i find the best thing is to get the trial size ones and figure out what ones you like and don't like, better than buying a whole bag. 

*Drink. Lots. Of. Water.* I can't emphasize this enough. You need to drink as much as you reasonably can. Ozempic will dehydrate you,  and water is essential for weight loss. Excretion is how the fat leaves your body. 

Remember that adding things like crystal lite, mio, lemon, or whatever else you need to in order to make your water easier to drink doesn't make it count any less as water. It all counts. Also, buying a water bottle you absolutely love helps. Tricks your brain into wanting it more.

Do your body measurements now. There will be times it feels like the scale isn't moving at all, but the measuring tape will, and you will be grateful that you did. 

Also, take ""Before"" pictures! It's something I didn't do but I wish that I had. You might hate the look of them now, but you'll be so happy to have something to compare to later.

The number one side effect people have is constipation, diarrhea is less common. Increasing your fiber intake helps with this significantly. (Personally, I really enjoy all bran with some milk and honey in the morning), but if it gets out of hand, remedies like restorlax, etc, will help. If you do end up with diarrhea, something like imodium should help, (but for me some of my other meditations can cause diarrhea, and they've been canceling each offer out lately). Another big side effect is nausea, ginger chews, tea, and supplements help, peppermint tea,  having protein and fiber before bed to give your stomach something to ""chew"" on for the night,  gravol (dramamine),  if it gets really bad some doctors will prescribe hefty anti nausea meds like zofran.

Another common side effect is hair loss.  It happens because of decreased nutritional intake as well as rapid weight loss.  Increasing your protein intake as well as some supplemental help can help nip that in the bud. What worked for me was increasing my protein and adding in biotin supplements and (*yes, it sounds crazy*) prenatal vitamins. It works.  My hair is almost back to normal, and I'm still losing. 

I probably missed something. If I did, I'll add it with an edit line. Feel free to ask if you have any questions! I've been on ozempic/wegovy for 2 years. I'll drop my stats underneath! Welcome! And congratulations again!

I wasn't over weight at the time (BMI wise I was, but in actual fat % no where close I was at 25% body fat and was an active mostly healthy Paralympian. Yet still the doctors in charge or such surgery refused based on BMI being to high (going private wasn't a option for various other medical reasons). 

Fast-forwards to 2003 when I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and my endocrinologist said that I needed to go onto insulin sensitivity medications to help make my body sensitive to insulin. Over the next 3 years I'd put on a solid 50lbs as I tried different insulin sensitivity medications and my insulin needs increased as did my a1c since I wasn't able to get my glucose under 10 (180) despite being very active, eating as I should things where working against me. 

In 2005, I was put on Byretta and within the month my glucose levels started to come down, end of the year my a1c was starting to come back down and the 50 that I'd gained 3 years before had started to lesson, by 2010 I was back to pre-Insulin Resistance weight and a little less to boot. Then it stopped helping and a1c started to go back up, as did the insulin - weight didn't shift in either direction. Was switched over to Victoza and nothing, no lowering of glucose levels, no lowering of a1c and no reduction in insulin needs regardless of the dosage, weight remained steady. Then in 2016 was moved to Trulicity and instead of things staying the same or getting better my insulin needs increased till I was needing 500U of U200 Humalog and 350u of u200 Tresiba, no improvement in a1c, it also continued to increase. No change in weight eight, was still the same as I had been in 2010. 

Then in 2018 I was switched over to Oz and at first it was no change, but when I started 0.5 that's when things started to shift in the right direction. A1c started to lower, active insulin dropped down to 100u a day and then evened out at 50u a day, but background insulin needs remained unchanged. for 6 years I stated at 0.5 because it got my a1c down to 5.5 and due to the continued shortages that kept me from getting a reliable and steady supply for way to long - I did louse ground when I was forced off one to many times, but always regained once I had a stable dosage long enough. 

Fat loss did happen, but I put on more muscle so it offset what the scale was showing, I went from 40% body fat down to 30% and when I moved up to 1mg last year I finally hit the 25% mark (though for a short time was at 22% - but that wasn't sustainable for medical reasons) and have stayed around there. Background insulin needs after 6 months went down to 200u of u200 Tresiba but there is no chance of it going lower as I can't increase from 1mg due to it being to dangerous due to my already low a1c. So I'm currently stuck at 1mg until another GLP-1 is approved that works as well or better then Oz (though I fear with the introduction of generics it will actually work worse and I'll see things climb once again and all the progress that was made since 2018 will be undone - due to my bad track record with generics/biosimilars'). 

So in short for me there has been nothing to get discourage about, a1c is in non-diabetic range and holding steady which was the goal of being on a glp-1 in the first place, any other positive side effects are a bonus in my books, including any fat reduction that's happened.",1.0

Focusing on whether something is ""natural"" is a choice. But it suggests interest in root causes. Calorie dense foods is just one factor, though thinking about the environment is on the right track.


Poor nutrition education and the societal disconnection from agriculture and understanding the food supply. Sedentary environments, tvs, computers, suburbs, cars, and desk jobs. Awareness of public health guidelines and the economic and location accessibility of produce. 


Recent weight loss approvals for GLP-1 medications can feel like a solution. But they don't solve much; I think they're only the next step. Treatments rather than a cure. They are expensive, have some side effect risks, and aren't fully accessible.",7.0

I firmly believe that most people who are currently overweight would be a healthy BMI if they only consumed foods that existed 100+ years ago.

The biggest help to me is to stop thinking of food as a way to only get rid of hunger. You have to think of it as nutrition. I make better food choices knowing something is giving me nutrients that my body needs vs empty calories. I prioritize protein and whole pure foods. If I have to eat something that came in a box or can, I look for the ones with the fewest ingredients and preservatives. They don't add sugars to food because you need carbs, they add it because their food tastes like crap without it.

When I would grocery shop in the past, I would have a cart full of breads, boxed and canned stuff. I would look at what others were buying, and just like my fat ass, all the overweight people had the same stuff piled high. The people who were fit looking had a small cart with fresh fruits, vegetables and unprocessed meats. I used to kind of chuckle and think they don't really enjoy food because who would eat that stuff? What joy is there in a salad? I'll stick with my cheap box of Mac and Cheese and case of Mountain Dew. My body and health has paid the price for that. Now I make nutrient dense meals and the flavors are incredible. Everything I put in my mouth, I consider the nutritional value of it. Btw, I love a good salad now. 

I am T2 but now off Metformin and my A1c is 5.1. Someday I will probably be off Ozempic but breaking old habits and learning a healthier way to eat is undoubtedly going to be the key to success. I know what got me to the overweight T2 me. I don't want to go back to that.",4.0

Sulphur burps are caused by food sitting and literally releasing sulphur. You’ll have to experiment a bit and see what foods don’t work for you. A lot of people get issues with things like cruciferous vegetables, legumes, some people struggle with raw vegetables. Also, lots of people go all out on “healthy” supplements - for example protein shakes and bars  - when they start the medication, and those types of foods often contain multiple ingredients that can cause digestive issues. Keep an eye out for things like carrageenan, sugar alcohol sweeteners, and artificial sweeteners. Any one of those could be the culprit, as could the protein source itself (people are quick to blame lactose when it comes to dairy, but there are other potential issues - I can have whey but not casein, for example, so I can’t get any protein drinks that have casein in the ingredients or aren’t 100% hydrolyzed whey).

I personally found digesting enzymes were a quick cure to sulphur burps. Stopped them within the same day. Now sometimes I take them preemptively if I’m going to eat something that could be challenging (like Brussel sprouts and steak), or I’ll take them at the first sign of indigestion if something just feels like it isn’t sitting right. All in all I use them probably once a month or so, and haven’t had sulphur burps since I started.",2.0

For other's the 0.25 is the only level that they ever need to reach a healthy A1C and if needing to louse weight start that process (others need a higher dosage to see weight change, but the higher dosage might bring glucose issues such as hypoglycaemia - so that also has to be factored into the mix, and yes a non-diabetic can still experience hypoglycemia episodes when taking a GLP-1. 

Which means for some people staying on 0.25 for years isn't uncommon before they see the need to increase to 0.5, just like there are those who see/feel nothing on 0.25 yet at  0.5 that's where for them things start to happen (positive and maybe negative). And again staying at 0.5 isn't uncommon for extended periods of time until it is deemed a higher dosage is needed for whatever medical person. 

I personally spent 6 years at 0.5 because at the dosage it was working as designed, a1c went into non-diabetic range and stayed there, active insulin lowered and over all things where very stable. For myself I only increased to 1mg because my background insulin wasn't going down, so I wanted to see if the higher dosage would lower my background insulin needs (it did, but it took 6 months before it started to happen, which was most annoying as the first reducing in active insulin happened within hours of my first injection of 0.5 - but that was far from the case with 1mg). 

1mg lowered by a1c even further, which means my endocrinologist will not increase any higher because the risk of hypoglycemia is just to great of a chance, so the background reduction I was hoping for is a dream it will not be lower then it is now because i'm maxed out at the dosage that is safe for me to take as things currently stand.",3.0

What are your experiences?,,,,Echoicembers,2025-10-27 16:59:52,,comment,nlqnk2x,"First off, as someone else said, ozempic and wegovy are exactly the same medication. Ozempic is just labeled for diabetes, and wegovy for weight loss. 

Secondly, for weight loss medications in Canada, it's generally blanket approvals. You're approved for semiglutide AND liraglutide (wegovy and saxenda), for example. 

I am through desjardins, and my husband is through bluecross/medavie. We have both been approved through both insurance companies, but you need to file preauthorization paperwork that you and your doctor fill out for all insurance companies, and they have to approve it. I know with bluecross the initial approval lasted 6 months, then it had to be resubmitted, and it was permanently approved after that. With desjardins, it's yearly.

ETA: however I will add, any employer insurance plan will be specific to your employer. I suggest searching the medication on your drug coverage on the app and seeing what it says. If its vague, or saying it needs authorization, it just means it needs preauthorization paperwork filed before its approved.",5.0
Ozempic,1ohrzwh,My doctor suggested switching from Ozempic to Wegovy to possibly get it covered by insurance for weight loss. What are your experiences?,,,,TheNyxks,2025-10-27 15:45:03,,comment,nlqa4b8,"All Canadian Insurance companies cover all GLP-1s and GLP-1/GIPs ... it is your specific plan that you have through your employer or have gotten yourself that will say what is and isn't covered. 

You can often get a run down of what is covered though HR, or by pulling up the plan you have and doing a search for a specific medication if the insurances formulary. However, most basic plans that companies tend to have for their staff doesn't cover GLP-1s unless you are diabetic, a few might if they have something like a health and wellness plan (I know the banks have such a extended plan that can be op-ed into), but sadly due to the cost many plans that do cover wagovy only cover up to a certain amount each year - often its around 5k worth of medication, which is only a couple months worth of pens and then you reach the max that is covered. 

So you also have to look into that aspect of things, if it is covered, because many people have be over joyed to find it covered only to learn that once they have been on it for 9 months (or less) that when they go to refill the script that they are paying full price as they reached the max for the year of it being covered, or in some cases life time coverage. 

If you know that you will likely need to pay out of pocket, wait. In 2026 three generic semaglutide biosimilars are going to be coming to market (once Health Canada approves them - the day the patent runs out the three makers are going to submit their deals and from there 3 to 6 months down the line we should start seeing them approved to market) as the patent that Nova has runs on in January 2026. It is being reported that the generic will cost upwards of 60 to 70% less then what the set price that the government has set for it to be sold at. So in some cases that could well be 40.00 to 50.00 per pen on average (in most cases under 100.00 is the consensus). Which means more plans might well open up to cover them since the cost will be less of a hit to their bottom line (but it also makes it more affordable for those who don't have coverage or who's plans just will not cover regardless.",4.0

Ozempic,1ohcerd,Having a positive experience so far and just want to share good vibes on this thread!!,"I did my first shot at .25 last week on Thursday. Traditionally for me, my overeating happens mainly on the weekends when I don't have the structure of the work day. On top of that, I had an 8 hour road trip planned for this past weekend. Another occasion where I would normally snack the whole damn drive and use it as an excuse to eat fast food. In addition to everything mentioned above, I am a coffee addict, love some weed, love a good glass of wine or cocktail, and nicotine. Current nicotine vessel is vaping (i know, none of these habits are great). HOWEVER. 

I was absolutely shocked at the immediate positive impact this has had on me. I had one coffee for the entire 4 hour one way drive (this would easily be a 2-3 coffee situation for me prior). Packed a protein shake, an apple, and some cheese sticks for the drive. More than enough to keep me satisfied. Barely used my vape, which I would normally be hauling on for a long solo drive. And normally would be croaking for a J on this drive, but I was not. 

Got to my hotel at my destination. Ordered a glass of wine. Took over an hour to drink it. Ordered some steak bites for an app. Stuffed half way through. Its like a whole new world.

Only side effect is a mild headache but I always dealt with mild headaches prior to this (probably from excessive coffee drinking LOL). 

All that to say, I feel motivated to quit all of my vices and actually feel like I can.. am I ... about to become an entirely new person?

LOL I know it is still early in the game. And who knows, maybe its just a placebo effect and the power of positive thinking.

For example, if you are 200lbs then 10% of that is 180 (which is under 2lbs a month loss - which isn't much by most peoples thinking). If you are 250lbs then 10% of that is 225lbs. It's slow, but it also varies based on level of insulin resistance, age, activity levels, and how your body actually responds to the GLP-1 medication, over all. 

Remember if your calories intake it too low, your body may burn muscle before fat. That's why dietitian's recommend no more than a 500-calorie deficit from your maintenance level, and not dropping below 1500 calories/day to avoid nutrient deficiencies. 

To know your numbers if is best to see a registered diabetic dietitian and work with them to figure out the right amount for your specific needs/lifestyle, etc. However, a general TDEE can give you a generic starting point, but your needs will shift every 20lbs that is lost. 

Ultimately weight loss isn't about the scale, it is about preserving muscle, improving glucose control and building sustainable long term habits. GLP-1s can support the process, but they are not magic. Their role is to help regulate how your body uses insulin, the rest is about how you fuel and move your body.",3.0

Ozempic,1oht2bz,Two Shots of 0.5mg Same As 1.0?,"My doctor gave me a 0.25-0.5 mg dose Ozempic pen. When it was done he gave me another and I am about half way through and not really feeling the effects any longer. This is when I would normally be dosed up to 1 mg so far as I can tell so was wondering if anyone has ever used a 0.5mg pen to take two shots to equal up to 1 mg. Logically it would seem the same as 1 shot from a 1mg dose pen but reading online it seems it can be a little more complex than that. 

So I’m wondering if anyone has ever done this or if there’s any advice about why this would be a bad or good idea?

Ozempic,1ogz8qj,"2 Years on Ozempic — Strict, Disciplined, and Still Stuck at the Same Weight. Scared to Stop Because the Food Noise Comes Back.","Hey everyone,

I’ve been on Ozempic for almost 2 years, now on Wegovy 2.4 mg, and I’m honestly at a loss. I’ve been trying to lose weight for 3 years straight and despite doing everything right, the scale hasn’t really moved.

I also take Metformin 500 mg, blood pressure meds, cholesterol meds, and Vyvanse 10 mg.

About 3 weeks ago I started doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and have stuck to it almost perfectly (just one 16:8 day). Before OMAD, I wasn’t a big eater either — I usually skipped breakfast and only ate lunch and dinner. I don’t drink any calorie beverages either, other than alcohol once a week.

Here’s what I’ve been doing consistently: High-protein, low-carb meals Calorie intake under 1,800/day Lifting 2–3x a week Walking/golf daily 2–3L of water + electrolytes 7+ hours of sleep with CPAP (sleep apnea managed)

Despite all that — I started at 273 lbs, dropped to 267 lbs the first week of OMAD, and now I’m right back at 273 lbs again. It’s like my body just refuses to let go of weight no matter how much I dial in my diet or exercise.

The most frustrating part? I actually feel healthier — my resting heart rate is down, energy is better, and I don’t feel sluggish anymore. But seeing zero movement on the scale after years of trying is disheartening.

And honestly, I’m terrified to stop Ozempic. The food noise — that constant mental chatter around food — was brutal before I started. It’s the one thing Ozempic completely silenced, and I’m scared it would all come back if I stopped.

Has anyone else hit this kind of long-term plateau where everything looks perfect on paper but your body just won’t budge? What finally worked for you — if anything? Did anyone switch medications or tweak something that finally moved the needle?

⸻

TL;DR: 2 years on Ozempic/Wegovy + Metformin, clean diet, fasting, workouts, no calorie drinks, and still the same weight. Feel better but can’t lose a pound.

But particularly for you, read through my dosing guidelines. But there might be other things that help you as well 😊


This is a general comment for first-time users/starters or people looking for advice 😊, I hope it helps!

Congratulations on taking this big first step!
Remember that this whole process is a marathon and not a sprint. 

I'll offer some advice to help you on your journey that I've given countless people in my time in this group and my time on ozempic/wegovy. 

First of all, don't expect miracle results overnight. Not everyone has the same timeline of results. Some people see results ""overnight"" with .25, some people don't see results until 1.0 or higher. 

Next, the recommended dosing guidelines for ozempic are a minimum of 4 weeks at each dose of .25, .5, 1.0, and 2.0 according to the official ozempic website and information. I *strongly* recommend you only increase by .25 at a time (.25, .5, .75, 1.0, 1.25, etc), you can find click charts online for your specific pen size to customize the dose (for example, each increment of .25 on a 1.0 dosing pen is 18 clicks). Stay on each dose a *MINIMUM* of 4 weeks. If the dose is still giving you good results after 4 weeks, stay on the dose. Filling those two guidelines will maximize the overall effectiveness of ozempic over time as well as minimize any potential for side effects. Only increase to the next dose when the current one loses effectiveness.

You need to follow the titration schedule or you risk more serious side effects, that's why the schedule exists in the first place. 

Also when doing your injection (usually belly, but some people do thigh), make sure your pinching the skin a good amount of the 'fatty' tissue and injecting into that area, and holding the needle there after your injection finishes clicking down for an extra count of at least 5 seconds (to make sure all of the medication was dispensed)

Thirdly: figure out your BMR and TDEE, you can Google a calculator to do that online and it will give you that right amount of calories to safely consume in order to lose weight while still getting adequate nutrition and the calories needed to survive. 

Also, you need to track your food and keep count of the calories of what you eat to stay in that range. I recommend finding a good app that you like. Personally, my favorite is loseit, but there are many great options out there. Tracking your food and staying in the calorie deficit is a key to success.

Try to prioritize protein and fiber as much as you can within your meals. There are a lot of great and creative ways to add them into your diet. When you don't feel like eating a protein shake is a great way to get some calories and protein in. There are always powders, and for premades, I find fairlife and Premier protein to be the best. As far as powders, i find the best thing is to get the trial size ones and figure out what ones you like and don't like, better than buying a whole bag. 

*Drink. Lots. Of. Water.* I can't emphasize this enough. You need to drink as much as you reasonably can. Ozempic will dehydrate you,  and water is essential for weight loss. Excretion is how the fat leaves your body. 

Remember that adding things like crystal lite, mio, lemon, or whatever else you need to in order to make your water easier to drink doesn't make it count any less as water. It all counts. Also, buying a water bottle you absolutely love helps. Tricks your brain into wanting it more.

Do your body measurements now. There will be times it feels like the scale isn't moving at all, but the measuring tape will, and you will be grateful that you did. 

Also, take ""Before"" pictures! It's something I didn't do but I wish that I had. You might hate the look of them now, but you'll be so happy to have something to compare to later.

The number one side effect people have is constipation, diarrhea is less common. Increasing your fiber intake helps with this significantly. (Personally, I really enjoy all bran with some milk and honey in the morning), but if it gets out of hand, remedies like restorlax, etc, will help. If you do end up with diarrhea, something like imodium should help, (but for me some of my other meditations can cause diarrhea, and they've been canceling each offer out lately). Another big side effect is nausea, ginger chews, tea, and supplements help, peppermint tea,  having protein and fiber before bed to give your stomach something to ""chew"" on for the night,  gravol (dramamine),  if it gets really bad some doctors will prescribe hefty anti nausea meds like zofran.

Another common side effect is hair loss.  It happens because of decreased nutritional intake as well as rapid weight loss.  Increasing your protein intake as well as some supplemental help can help nip that in the bud. What worked for me was increasing my protein and adding in biotin supplements and (*yes, it sounds crazy*) prenatal vitamins. It works.  My hair is almost back to normal, and I'm still losing. 

I probably missed something. If I did, I'll add it with an edit line. Feel free to ask if you have any questions! I've been on ozempic/wegovy for 2 years. I'll drop my stats underneath! Welcome! And congratulations again!

Ozempic,1oh2ldn,Hypoglycemia & neuroglycopenia while on OZ?,"So, i’ve been on and off of Ozempic for like over a year

This last time I was off of it for two or three weeks because of insurance issues

I just took my dose Tuesday, 0.25

I started having these strong reactions whenever my blood sugar would start to fall

The reaction was to the blood sugar falling, not the number itself

For example, I would go from 130 all the way down to 80 in the span of one hour

And I’m not gorging myself with empty sugar calories or high carbs or anything like that. 

I’ve kept a very strict food diary since restarting Ozempic.

The only time I have any “strong sugar” is when I have to treat a rapid fall that accompanies a bunch of really scary symptoms. 

Has anyone out there had anything like this after being on Ozempic?

I sent my doctor a message because today was just hell for me. 


The fast rate falling symptoms, especially the ones that are neuroglycopenia in nature : non painful pressure/congestion feeling in head that only goes away as blood sugar gets stabilized. 

Is honestly making me scared to drive, shower, get up and walk around, live a normal life.

I put in a phone call to my doctor and also sent a very urgent message through the messaging portal and I will be calling first thing tomorrow to follow up for an immediate appointment

But have any of you ever experienced “reactive hypoglycemia” while on Ozempic? 

Thank you 😊

Ozempic,1ogl924,Costco Pricing in Canada,,,,Allimack,2025-10-26 12:09:09,,comment,nliw39r,"The red box pens include 2 mg of Semaglutide in 3mL of solution. The initial prescription is usually for 2 red boxes. The red box pens allow the 0.25 and 0.50 dosage. The starting dosage is usually 4 weeks x 0.25 and then two weeks of 0.5. So the first red box pen lasts for 6 weeks. The second red box pen allows for 2 more weeks at 0.5 and then 1 week at 1.0. Or 4 weeks at 0.5mg.

At that point you would be moved over to the blue box pen. The blue box pen contains 4mg of Semaglutide and the only setting on the pen is the 1.0 dose.

When I started Ozempic in February (in Ontario) the red box was about $240 and when I moved up to the blue box (which contains twice as much medicine) the cost went up by about $10, currently it is $252.

The blue box is a much better deal per mg, but the lower dosages aren't marked on it, and the blue box pen only comes with 4 needles (the red box comes with 6). 

I think the $482 price you are looking at is the cost of 2 red box pens. Each one on its own is ~$241. You potentially save on one of the $4.99 dispensing fees by having both dispensed at once. If you can't afford to pick up both red boxes at once, then just tell them you want one. It's better not to buy both, anyway, since you don't yet know how well you will tolerate it.

Edited to add: I was really happy getting my prescription from Costco. At the first prescription pick up the pharmacist walked me through the initial testing of each pen (where you place a needle on it and turn it just to the first notch and test that the pen works; you only do this once, at the first dose of each new pen). I had watched a video in advance, but it was helpful to have it explained in person. The pharmacist also gave me a free ""sharps"" container for the needles. And during the summer months they always offered a cold pack with my prescription (which I never needed as I always had my own cooler bag with ice packs in the car).",3.0

For me, during the first month I was on 0.5 mg, and now I’m on 1.0 mg in my second month. But honestly, I don’t really feel a big difference in my appetite. I’m still quite the foodie — I still crave chips, and sometimes I even feel like cooking instant noodles late at night.

Ozempic,1og69kx,New food sensitivity after a year? Sweet Tea is now an enemy 🤢,"​Hey everyone,
​I've been on Ozempic for about a year now and it's been mostly great! good weight loss, side effects have been minimal and predictable, mostly just mild nausea/fullness when I overdo it.
​But recently, I've had a couple of really rough, and honestly, kind of bizarre reactions to food that I never had before on the medication.
​The biggest culprit, and the reason for this post, is sweet tea.
​I've had it occasionally over the last year without issue. However, I've now had two separate situations in the last week where I had sweet tea and within an hour or so, I started lurching/gagging/near-vomiting. It's that awful feeling where you can tell your stomach is just NOT having it. After I puked I was fine both times. 
​Has anyone else this far out (a year+ in) developed a new, intense sensitivity to a specific food or drink that you were fine with previously?
​It's weird that I'm only having this extreme reaction now. Is it possible that the delayed gastric emptying has slowly made certain foods intolerable over time, even if I was okay with them initially?
​Just wondering if I'm alone in this or if my body is just officially filing an injunction against sweet tea.


​TL;DR: Been on Ozempic for a year, just recently started having vomiting reactions to sweet tea, even though I was fine with it before. Did anyone else develop a weird, new food sensitivity this far into their journey?",5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1og69kx/new_food_sensitivity_after_a_year_sweet_tea_is/,Flat-Sprinkles-2367,2025-10-25 16:49:44,11.0,post,,,

I recommend losing between 1.5 and 2kg a week to help your skin and not lose muscle.

Also I don't think you should stay on 0.25 longer because you don't have any bad side effects and smaller doses stop wroking pretty fast. 

Faster weight loss usually goes for 4-8 weeks for most people, so don't worry about speed fr now as long as you feel fine. Starting from 3rd month, you should aim to lose no more than 1% of your body weight per week. At 170kg it would be 1.7 kg per week.

Wegovy,1okmcn9,Need a pep talk during a 2-month plateau after switching from Zepbound.,"I switched from Zepbound to Wegovy 2 months ago and have completely stalled out. 
I responded really well to Zepbound, and lost ~40lbs in 4 months (and was up to 7.5mg dose)
My dr put me on .5mg of Wegovy for the first month, and now I’m on the 1mg — this was to be cautious about any side effects.
So, on the one hand, not gaining weight after dropping to such a low dosage is good. But after seeing such drastic change to nothing is frustrating. I’m just anxious that Wegovy won’t do anything for me.
So! In an effort to bring my logical brain back to the party, I’m curious what a good baseline is. 
For folks who also had to switch, have you had a similar experience? How long did it take you to start seeing progress after the switch? ",3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wegovy/comments/1okmcn9/need_a_pep_talk_during_a_2month_plateau_after/,claireify12,2025-10-30 22:27:41,5.0,post,,,

I was on Zepbound from February through July and lost close to 50 lbs. I’ve lost another 10 or so on Wegovy, from August until today. 

I titrated up every month on Zepbound so ended on 15mg but had only been on that dose for a month. My doctor switched me straight to 2.4 Wegovy (I switched because of an insurance formulary change, CVS).

I think you’ll see better results if and when you up your dose. Compared to Zepbound, Wegovy has been a lot easier on me aside from occasional constipation. I wish I was still losing as quickly as I was on Zepbound but I feel a lot stronger and am exercising a lot more regularly on Wegovy, and part of that is because Zepbound left me with zero appetite so I felt weak and lightheaded a lot of the time. I also use a wearable that tracks my heart rate, sleep, etc and according to that my body is a lot happier on Wegovy. In the end everyone is different but I think you’ll be fine moving up on dosage.

Does anyone else get extreme pain when injecting their dose? I’ve never felt a pain like it. It’s honestly 10/10 pain. 

I have had needles hundreds of times and I have never experienced pain like that before. I switch injection sites each week, ensuring to avoid muscle, and I leave it out in room temperature a few hours before I take it.

Wegovy,1ok8hf9,Would love feedback from people who’ve been on this product for a year or more. Even better if 3+ years.,"I’ve been taking Wegovy for maybe 13-14 months. I’ve had great success. I have tolerated it very well (although with some constipation from time to time) and have lost about 45 lbs. I’m currently at the highest available dose. I’m really not losing any more, as I’ve been at this weight for probably six months, and I don’t care to lose anymore, so all is good. My concern: what’s the end game? I have zero confidence I won’t just start eating more once I stop using it. (I have begun slowing doses to every ten days but am afraid to spread it out further as maybe it’ll affect tolerability). Have people gone off, then on? Have people had success with other strategies? My doctor is just a GP, and I don’t think he has much experience with this. Probably nobody does as it’s pretty news.

Wegovy,1ojj6mn,Wegovy after failed Zepbound,"Hi friend. Title covers it. I took Zepbound for 8 months, including titrating up to 10mg and staying on that dose for 2-3 months. I do not have diabetes but I do have PCOS. I was the opposite of a super responder; I barely lost 6% of my body weight. 

I recently filled a script for WeGovy. I’m hopeful but not optimistic. I’m concerned that I might just not respond to GLP-1s. 

Has anyone switched off of Zepbound for lack of weight loss and been successful on WeGovy? If so, what percent of your weight did it take off?

I lost no weight the first month and had no side effects but she refused to move my dose even though the manufacturer recommends moving monthly. I could understand if I lost a lot or if I was ill but neither of those things occurred. Now I need to find a new Telehealth vendor.

Check w your doctor, but I take generic unisom (doxylamine succinate) and it makes the nausea manageable.  I did the same when I had hideous morning sickness with my pregnancies.  Oddly it doesn't make me any more tired. 


I've read that some get an Rx for zofran for nausea, but I didn't bother b/c it didn't work for me for morning sickness.  


I know it's hard to eat or drink when you feel awful, but I keep telling myself I'll feel worse if I don't at least drink and eat something small every few hours.  Oatmeal or yogurt is easiest for me.


Good luck & hope you find relief!",2.0

You should also consider staying at the lower dose for longer as others have said. 

Talk with your doc about nausea. You need to eat more because not eating also contributes to nausea. Your blood sugar is probably suffering too.

Wegovy,1oh7a8q,"0.25 MG Wegovy, I loved you but I must move on to 0.50 .","I am extremely proud of myself ! It definitely hasn't been easy, but I have so much more energy now . I'm more confident. I'm also only taking 1 blood pressure medication ! Where as before ( just 4 weeks and 1 day ago ! ) , when I was 271.9, I had to take 3 different blood pressure medications a day, and now I only take 1 Blood Pressure Medication a day ! Bonus, all my labs look great, and my A1.C is now looking beautiful! 

So, I want to be completely transparent and honest. I was/am/always have been a HUGE BINGER/BINGE EATER !
It was so bad on/to me in numerous ways, including but not limited to , mentally,  spiritually,  emotionally,  and financially. As in while eating 1 meal, I would already be eagerly anticipating my next meal and/or snack. 

Especially at night, after I put my youngin to bed. I would just eat and eat and eat . To the point that my stomach would be in so much pain , and most nights I would throw up ( Not on purpose, definitely not bulimia, instead i would throw up because I had over stuffed my stomach because I obviously ate way too much ) even still I would continue to eat. I wouldn't eat out for real , actual hunger , but because food helped me feel better and mask/hide my emotions from everything I had gone through.  

I've noticed that I'm much more patient, empathetic, and compassionate, and I also give myself more grace , not just with my toddler but also with complete strangers! I smile all the time, and folks reciprocate with smiles and small talk !

 Most importantly ( at least, to me ) is that I'm a much better and healthier mother to my very strong-willed ,very loved, very much always wanted, very active, 3 year old toddler, lol . Now, I can actively play with him ! Including chasing him, hide and seek, running up and down, and all over playgrounds with him, going all over the zoo, etc . All things I couldn't hardly be active for more than 10 minutes ! 

 Honestly, I think several different things/lifestyle changes/ daily exercise/meal planning , loghing , charting, and tracking everything in MyNetDiary APP.  As well as meal prep/plus my Miraculous , Glorious, Wegovy - I did 0.25 MG for 4 weeks , 

The last 7-10 days on the 0.25 mg were the absolute hardest because the ""food noise "" started to creep back in , which also coincided with my ovulation. 

I did have a follow up with my PCP Dr , She's amazing and we discussed any/all side effects and i let her know that,  while yes I lost weight,  my "" food noise "" was coming back with a vengeance.  So I agreed to go up to the next dose. Which is 0.50 1X a week . So far, it's been nothing short of a miracle gor me ! I have another follow-up with my PCP Dr on 12/22/2025. And I'm determined to lose another at least 25-40lbs a month before I see her 

All combined are the reason why I'm happier, healthier and why I have more patience now as a woman and a SMBC ( SOLO MOTHER BY CHOICE) who in just 4 weeks 1 day has lost a total of 31.3 lbs !!! 

Started- 

September 27th, 2026, 271.9 lbs

Now-

10/26/2025-  240.3 lbs !!! 

That's  a total of 31.3 lbs in 4 weeks, 1 day !

As a huge added bonus , I'm not in as much pain , so that makes me feel tremendously better (even though it's only 31.3 lbs so far ) versus before when I was even 271.9 ! 

 I take my 3 year old on 30-minute walks 2X a day. I also take him to the park and actively play with him the entire time . While as before, I could only play a few minutes at the park with him before I had to sit down and typically sat on my phone for the rest of the time we were at the park. 

Also , even though I've lost 31.3 lbs , I don't see much of a change physically.  I'm still wearing the same clothes from 31.3 lbs ago. But , i physically feel BETTER and have more energy and more stamina!
 
I'm kinder to myself and try to remind myself that I didn't gain all this weight instantly or overnight, but it took years to get to 271.9 lbs  . So , down to 240.3 in just 4 weeks and 1 day or 29 days total ! Is AMAZING to me because I honestly never thought I would get here ! 

 I try to always have an Attitude of Gratitude because, Just like my toddler isn't going to just magically be able to control their emotions/outbursts and tantrums immediately! It takes patience,  compassion, empathy/understanding, and the ability to recognize that, unfortunately, sometimes life just isn't fair.  

For Example- 
While Betty Jo down the street eats ginormous , ungodly amounts of food ( at least when you see her ), and yet she still weighs the same as she did in high school! Ugh , that can be so triggering and devastating!  I caution you from these thoughts,  because all you have to do is remind yourself,  YOU are NOT HER ! YOU have zero clue what goes on behind closed doors ! Maybe she's depressed.  Maybe she's in an extremely abusive relationship,  or 
Maybe she has a medical condition and wishes she could GAIN weight! Maybe she's on drugs and burns through all the extra calories and then some.  Maybe she's bulimic? Maybe she had/has plastic surgery? Or on the other hand. Maybe she only eats OMAD, so it's a huge portion with a full day of calories, and you just happen to see her then . Maybe she's also on a GLP-1S. Regardless of her reasons, Please try and remind yourself that HER Journey,  HER life , Her Decision, HER LIFESTYLE, and HER CHOICE(S) and everything she chooses to consume or do is NONE of your business.  IT has NOTHING to do with you! REMEMBER IT IS NEVER OKAY TO COMMENT ON ANOTHER WOMAN'S BODY ! UNLESS/UNTILL , YOU'VE WALKED A MILE IN HER SHOES, YOU NEED TO MIND YOUR OWN BISCUITS AND YOUR LIFE WILL BE GRAVY ! 

STOP COMPARING YOURSELF/LIFE/JOURNEY to others ! We are all beautifully, uniquely ourselves 💖

COMPARISON IS THIEF OF JOY 💖

So, instead of sitting/laying around bemoaning my wasted life , I'm now ACTIVELY Participating IN MY LIFE ! I am no longer just a spectator in mine and my 3 year olds' lives ! Instead, I'm now an active and willing participant in mine, and my toddlers lives 💙

I do track and log over EVERYTHING,  including water in the MyNetDiary APP. I use the free version.  It's awesome, and I can also enter food(s) , meals, and/or drinks before I eat/drink them . That way, I'm able to stick to less than 1200 calories a day, and I can add or remove BEFORE consuming so that I don't go over ! It also has a bar code scanner that you can use ( also free) to easily see all nutrient facts, including serving size, etc .

You can also add steps per day and exercise, sleep,  medications, etc ! All free , that's why I'm not going to bother to pay 9$ a month when the free version works just as well !

WE HOT THIS! WE ARE STRONG, BEAUTIFUL, BRAVE WEIGHT LOSS WARRIOR QUEENS 💖💋💕

As always, anyone feel free to message me anytime. Y'all want to chat/vent/rage/need a shoulder to cry on or to celebrate a win ! I'm here for Y'all 💕

Wegovy,1ohqhc0,Just starting!,,,,squatsandthoughts,2025-10-27 14:48:25,,comment,nlpzzqa,"Acid reflux is common because of the slowed digestion. There are various methods to address it such as taking an acid reducer like famotidine (more effective than tums), Prilosec (even more effective for the longer term but you may still need famotidine or tums). Check with your doc on these. 

Adjusting how you eat or drink such as:

- Less foods that elicit more acid response such as chocolate, things with tomatoes, spicy food, carbonated beverages, etc (you can google for a full list but you don't need to cut, just lower the volume of these foods)

- Smaller meal volume when eating

- Drinking more fluids like flat water 

- Space meals out especially before laying down

Also know that stomach acid can cause nausea, which is also a common complaint with these meds. Address the nausea with an acid reducer first and if that doesn't help them go to something like Zofran if needed (talk with your doc, obviously). 

It should get better over time!",2.0

Wegovy,1ohjw6c,3 Tiny Pulmonary Embolisms + Unexplained Heart Issues. Anyone else?? Is Wegovy the cause?!,"*Posting in case this helps someone else going through something similar — and to hear from others who’ve had a comparable experience.*

I’m a 36F. Started Wegovy in June 2025 at 175 lbs, now down to 148 lbs.

At the end of August, I went to the ER for what I thought might be kidney stones (not in severe pain, just wanted imaging sooner). During the workup, my D-dimer came back elevated, which can indicate a blood clot. That prompted a CT scan, which showed a tiny pulmonary embolism (PE) in my left lung. They also did leg ultrasounds—no other clots found. I was started on blood thinners immediately and referred to a hematologist.

The hematologist thought the PE was likely from a recent 7-hour flight and wasn’t overly worried. He planned for 3 months of blood thinners but scheduled a follow-up CT after one month. The original clot had resolved, but two new, very small clots were seen in my right lung. He wasn’t sure if they were new or missed initially (they were tiny). Either way, he extended treatment to 6 months.

Around that time, I started the highest Wegovy dose. Within a couple of weeks, I noticed shortness of breath, nausea, and headaches every hour or so, but brushed it off. After about five days, I was lying in bed one evening when my vision went woozy and started fading — I felt like I was about to faint. My husband helped me up, and my chest tightened while both calves cramped like charley horses. We called 911.

Paramedics said my vitals were mostly fine — slightly high BP and elevated pulse. They took me to the ER. EKG was clear. A third CT scan showed all previous PEs were gone. I was discharged and told to follow up with my primary care doctor.

My primary referred me to a cardiologist and ordered a brain MRI — both came back clear. My heart looked strong on the echocardiogram. But I still didn’t feel right.

Before starting Wegovy, my resting heart rate was in the 50s. It gradually increased (60s → 70s → and now in upper 80s/low 90s). After that fainting episode my pulse sometimes jumps to 110–115 while sitting. Light walking pushes it into the 120s. That's what my pulse rate would be after HIIT workout classes!! I now wake up every morning with my heart pounding and i think its generally impacting my sleep/restfuless (as confirmed by my oura ring). I constantly feel fluttering, or my heart racing, or a blood draining from my head feeling.

I’m currently wearing a Holter monitor for rhythm testing, but all other results have been “normal.” My oxygen and BP are fine, but when my heart rate spikes and then drops, I get severe headaches and nausea. My Oura ring flags “elevated resting heart rate” every day, and my Apple Watch has repeatedly alerted my husband (my emergency contact) that my ""heart rate is high while inactive for 10 + minutes"".

I just don’t feel like myself these last few weeks. The timing of the newest symptoms definitely align with starting the highest dose of wegovy - constant pounding heart, fatigue, and dizziness... but all the tests to check whats wrong keep coming back “normal.” I am also convinced that the PE's were caused by the wegovy as well and have read some similar stories on here.  Yet no doctors believe what I am going through is because of Wegovy.

Wegovy,1ohbg4k,On wegovy after being on mounjaro!,Hello!  So this time last year I was pushing 13 stone. I started on mounjaro with amazing success losing over 4 stone ending up at 8 stone 6. I then stopped mounjaro due to the price and put on a stone in a couple of months. I then started on wegovy last month after about 2 months off mounjaro and on Friday I went up to 0.5ml in wegovy. The issue is nothing is happening. I’m not losing weight and I still have a lot of food noise. I do have a lot of nausea in the morning which I didnt get on mounjaro. So my question is will it start working when I’m on a higher dose or is it not worth it? Being on mounjaro helped me in so many ways including completely clearing up my severe psoriasis.

Wegovy,1oeunp2,WEGOBY changed my life,"I'm so happy! Because for the first time in a long time I not only lose weight, but I want and need to move.
I tell you, I am 45 years old and I have been on a diet since I was 13. I did many diets in my life, achieving a maximum weight of 118 and a minimum of 69 in all this time. 
I started when I was 13 years old and 106 kilos (I was already a fully developed girl at that age, 170 cm tall), in 6 months I lost 37 kilos, staying at 69 kg, a weight at which I was beginning to be very thin, since my doctor at that time asked me not to go below 70.
The fact is that I went up to 75 and stayed there for many years... but then life, pregnancies and my metabolism made me reach 118 kilos at the age of 45 (with a million various fluctuations over the years, 3 or 4 more diets with great weight loss, Mediterranean diet, Keto, pills... but always starting over) 
And here I am, with WEGOBY, a year ago I started with 118 kilos and I am currently at 72... it has been slow and easy, but the best thing is that it was the only descent in which my body asked me to move, first the walks, then using stairs instead of the elevator, every day more and more, I felt my body more agile and stronger and I wanted and needed to move it, then the gym came, feeling sore, feeling strength, seeing how my swollen and sore feet began to reduce inflammation and move faster, 2 days of gym a week, after 2 months go up to 3 days a week, complement it with an elliptical at home... I couldn't believe it, for the first time in my life I loved moving my body, every day I wanted more, and I felt all of this reflected on the scale and in the mirror.
Today I weigh 72, I go to the gym 3 days a week to strengthen and I eat slowly with the elliptical 2 days at home for 45 minutes. On Saturdays and Sundays I walk as much as I can and it's not just about having lost kilos, it's about feeling my body strong, connecting with it, loving it and taking care of it.

Wegovy,1oec5di,I think I did 4 doses as my first..,"I was prescribed WeGovy and to start at .25mg

The pharmacists showed me the window and how to do the dial to .25 and to click it and wait for the click sound and it’ll click again, said the window will fill with a yellow thing and then said “watch a YouTube video to see how exactly”

So I came home and did that. Cleaned the site and put a needle on, set it to .25 and put it to my abdomen and clicked. The dial went down but it didn’t make a second click and the yellow thing never showed up in the window so I did it again. 

Finally a grey thing showed up in the window. I caped the needle and put it in the sharps box but now the grey part won’t go back down. 

Did I just give myself the whole pen? I got 1 pen and 4 needles. Now the dial won’t turn. 

Do I need to go to the doctor? What do I do in the case I may have injected 1.5mg instead of .25mg. ",14.0,https://i.redd.it/yc79lfa2uwwf1.jpeg,1finewire5,2025-10-23 12:08:09,34.0,post,,,

It doesn't matter is the needle on top of the pen or not, it depends just on the med leftover. In this case instead of one 0.25mg dose you took all 4 x 0.25mg doses, that means you injected 1mg in total and now your pen is empty, although it should last a month: 4 needles = 4 weeks.

Wegovy,1oec5di,I think I did 4 doses as my first..,,,,Hot-Bird2840,2025-10-23 13:14:32,,comment,nl0nt4v,"It sounds like the pharmacist may have watched a video for the single dose pens. The multidose pens don’t have a yellow thing. You just wind up to the dose, inject it, then push and hold the button until it winds back down to zero. If you didn’t wind it up again after it got back to zero, you won’t have accidentally given extra doses. I’m not sure why the dial won’t turn, but maybe you need to have a needle on it, or maybe you’re trying to turn it the wrong way. You shouldn’t be winding it up until you’re ready to give your second dose next week. So, my suggestion would be to wait until then, and then carefully follow the instructions again - making sure they’re your own instructions, not something that came off the internet and could be for the wrong type of pen. (There’s no second click for multidose pens, and the grey thing isn’t supposed to go back down.)

ETA: I just read more carefully, and saw that you said you “did it again” after not seeing a yellow thing in the window. If by “did it again” you mean that you wound it up to .25 again and repeated the injection process, then in that case, you will have given yourself however many doses you did repeat injections for. The full .25 mg pen has four doses, which is 1.0 mg in total, if you gave all four doses at once. That’s not technically an overdose, as Wegovy can be prescribed up to a weekly dose of 2.4mg. However, you’re more likely to have side effects if you start on a higher dose. It won’t hurt you, but it may be unpleasant.",10.0

Wegovy,1oe2ztm,3week check'in,"week1 and 2 was great! very little hunger noise on week 1. a little more on week 2, but it disappeared again now week 3. So I wonder if I messed up the injection on wk2 maybe. No real side-effects so far.   
  
I a bit more tired this week, but I have not been great at eating well either.   
On tuesday I demolished 2 packs of chocolate (so about 500gram in total), and then one apple. And yesterday I ate a good meal (salmon with lots of veggies), as well as fruits. so I guess it makes sense that I lack energy as I have not eaten a lot at all. I am also on week 5 without a job, so I am getting lazier and lazier. I got a job interview tomorrow and I hope I get that one, as being at home all day does not help lol. 

So far 4kg (8lb) down. It was 3kg (6lb) first week, it was pretty stable the 2nd, and then 1kg this week (2lb). So I am very much still at the start of the journey.   
Already had 3 different fruits today. and I am so full lol. But going to take a small walk (20min) to the store to get dinner instead of driving, I think today is a meatballs day. 

If it's still as effective on week 4. I will ask the doc if I should increase or just stay on the 0.25g so far. I am supposed to go over to 0.5 now on week 5, but unsure if I should wait until week 9 for that instead.

Wegovy,1odeuy9,My story; 4 weeks in and going strong,"As I’ve used a.o. This subreddit heavily in my decision process to start with Wegovy, I think it’s only fair if I report back to you guys as well. I’m a 54 yr, male, located in Sweden and 2 months back I’ve told by my doctor that I had to make some radical changes and loose weight as soon as possible. I will not go into the medical reasons too much,  except that he decided to support to prescribe medication. At that time my weight was around 122,5 kgs (270 lbs) with a BMI of over 40. My goal is too loose 10 kgs (22 lbs) by Xmas and 30 kgs (66 lbs) by Midsummer 2026

I took 2 weeks to reflect and analyse on which medication I wanted to take, obviously I landed on Wegovy. Mainly because of it’s ease of use, affordable pricing (Wegovy is not covered by the Swedish health insurance) and high efficacy\*\*:\*\* It prediction to be very effective for significant and sustained weight loss. next to that Systemic benefits where of consideration: Beyond weight the potential improvement of cardiovascular risk factors and may help to manage my blood pressure. 

However, what I also did in those weeks was:

* Started up a high protein, no carb, no sugar, diet supported by counting calories to make sure I would land on approx 1200-1500 Kcal per day, which I know is acceptable for me and on it’s own creates the right circumstances to loose weight. My partner is a food nutrition and she was great help in making a breakfast/lunch/dinner plan. We’re going in together on this, which helps.
* I make sure to drink; my goal is 2,5 liter per day and I keep track of both my food and water intake through the Lifesum app, which works really well together with Apple Health. 
* I stopped drinking alcohol completely, and i will do until Xmas at minimum. Most probably I’ll have a few glasses of very nice wine around the holidays and then stop again. I was a moderate but regular consumer of wine (one bottle a week)
* I started exercising at least 3 times per week. A good program set up by a former PT I still had on file, also directed to weight loss.
* I’ve started to be rigid on my sleep regime. No late night binge watching anymore. I make sure I get 7,5-8 hours sleep every night. 

In the first 2,5 weeks I lost about 4 kgs (9lbs) and then I started on Wegovy 0.25. So far so good, I’m very happy with it.  During these first 2 weeks it was managable, driven by motivation, but I had continuous food and snack cravings. Wegovy has taken that away, almost completely. Although to the end of the 7 day period the effect is decreasing, but easy to manage. I have very little cravings, and need for bigger portions. I stop eating when my body says so, even if that means food waiste. It is was it is. 

Yes I’ve had the nausea and headaches, especially on the days after I’ve injected. I manage that by injecting on Friday nights, as my Saturdays are generally for recovery anyhow. I do notice I’m a bit lower on energy, but generally I feel better. Fatty food is a problem for me, I get sick more or less directly. I had an Indian curry 2 weeks ago and that didn’t go down very well. Reflux is a bit more troublesome then before, especially at night I find myself needing to take a Gaviscon tablet, other stomach protectors don’t really do anything for me. I do allow myself my guilty pleasure (licorice, lakrits) but max 2 pieces a day, a not a full bag.

What I accomplished so far (about 6 weeks in, including. 4 Wegovy 0.25 mg injections)

* I lost in total 7.1 kgs (15.6 lbs) and my BMW is down to 37
* My blood pressure is slowly improving (I’ve got hypertensia), 
* so is my digestion and my stool
* I fart much less.
* I sleep like a baby, with much little days of elevated apnea risk
* I’m down one size in clothing, my pointy beer belly is slowly decreasing.

I feel much better in general and people around me start to spot the difference, which is rewarding. This Friday I’ll start with 0,5 mg, I’

I’m comfortable with this approach and I’m very motivated to make a change. I find it easier to keep up with Wegovy, and (so far) little risk on fall backs.  With a regular diet I would make it about this time in and that it would start to slide. I‘m pretty sure that it’s the combination of factors which make me loose about 1,2 kg per week.

This is my story, I wanted to share it as a tribute to all of you sharing. I’m happy to take questions, and will report back in a couple of weeks after the 0.5mg series.

For wegovy the quickpen can be used more often. You can count clicks to divide your dose and get more out of one pen. For example you can use a 1mg pen for 4x0.25mg, 4x0.5mg and 1x1mg and get your first 9 dosages from one pen. Just make sure to keep the pen refrigerated and use a fresh needle every time.

Europe and Australia has multi dose Wegovy pens, that means you can buy higher dose pen and count clicks, like use just a half dose instead of full dose, and the pen will last twice longer, just keep it in the fridge and use with a new needle each time. The pen will work as long as there's some liquid left inside its built-in vial. The dial goes backward without injection, so google Wegovy click tables for your dose pen and then count the number of clicks that you need from ""0"" mark.

Wegovy,1ocqljj,Swapping from Wegovy to Mounjaro - thoughts??,"Looking for some advice/feedback! I was on Wegovy for 10 weeks and saw really great progress - lost 15 pounds, felt like I was getting back into a healthy lifestyle, felt more like myself. However, on weeks 9 and 10, I swapped to the mid-tier dosage and all of a sudden experienced intense increases in my anxiety and depression. Due to my history and struggle with both, my doctor decided to stop the Wegovy while we looked into a solution. Her idea was to try Zepbound, but my insurance suddenly isn’t approving Zepbound, regardless of the risks with Wegovy. 

Instead, they’re sending over a form for my doctor to fill out for Mounjaro. I’ll be completely honest in saying I have a negative association with Mounjaro for reasons I don’t know - I’m not sure if it’s because I heard something or read something negative, but I can’t shake the feeling that this isn’t the right drug for me. My issue is I have nothing to back that up. The Wegovy was prescribed for a) weight loss to help with a former knee and leg injury, and b) due to concerns of a binge eating disorder. My concern I think is stemming from Mounjaro being used for diabetic patients, which I have been screened for and do not have any indicators in even at risk (my mom is diabetic so there were initial concerns there as well).

If anyone has experience either swapping from Wegovy or even other drugs to Mounjaro, or even just advice from people who have solely been on Mounjaro, please share your experiences with me.

Wegovy,1obo7bz,Ten months! 224 to 157. My(30s f) BMI is finally “normal”!,"Just here to say this stuff rocks. I’m a woman, early 30’s, 5’7. Aside from my butt being a little deflated these days, I couldn’t be happier with the results so far. I’m aiming for 140lbs, but might go smaller if I feel like I want to. My target was to hit that by 6/2026 as you can see on the screenshot, but it looks like I’ll hit it in early January! I’ve tried to focus on protein and healthy food, but I admit that I’m not always perfect. I eat about one meal a day— not because i necessarily want to, that’s just all my stomach seems to have room for now. My blood pressure is quite low and sometimes I get a little faint when I stand up after being down for a while, but that’s how I was as a teenager too and my doc isn’t worried. 

The weight loss is awesome and I’m so stoked to be under 160! But what I really care about is the fact that I’m within a “normal” bmi range. That was my goal post these last ten months. Now I’m here and can start focusing on building a buffer zone of weight fluctuation (and there are a lot thanks to my cycle)!

I can’t wait to have these last 17pounds gone, move to a maintenance dose, and hopefully get a little of my butt back, haha. I have PCOS and did everything right re: health, and still couldn’t lose weight. This stuff was a miracle for me. I have regular periods now. I physically feel younger. So many aches and pains are just gone. I’m not ashamed to be seen by old friends or be in family pics like I was before. I’m so thankful.

I had it right through the first eight weeks (four weeks at .25 and four weeks at .5). However, I stayed on .5 and didn’t go up to 1mg, and it went away around week 8 or 9. It has come back now that I’m stepping up the dose again. However, I’m sure everyone is different, so my experience may not be the same as yours!",4.0

I’ve lost another 18lbs since then, though things have slowed in the last few weeks. I’ve got about 15-20lbs left before I hit my goal, and I’ll likely talk to my provider about a dose increase at my next check-in.

I'm 5'1.5"", 56 years old, currently on 2.4 mg semaglutide per week. I eat reasonably, get good sleep, weight train 5 days per week and get over 10K steps per day.  Super happy with my progress so far!   I have 40.5 pounds to go to get to the top of my normal weight range, but honestly if i didn't lose another pound from where i am right now, i'd still be really really happy. I lost weight rapidly at first (LOTs of water weight/inflammation) and am now losing about a pound per week.

I started my journey with diet change (focus on whole food) and walking, and have gradually increased my activity as weight loss has allowed me.   I feel amazing!!  Couldn't walk for 15 minutes in 90 degree heat when i started and now can go hiking, get up off the ground without effort, can easily climb onto a chair to get things from the top shelves of my cabinets. Life is good!!

semaglutide,1oldzhs,Some dieting tips & guidelines I have found useful in my SG weight loss journey,"These are some takeaways, tips, and observations I have found useful for my SG weight loss journey. I'm currently down 50 lbs in 7.5 months. These might not coordinate with everyone's observations, but they have been useful for me in losing weight and staying on track.

1: First, as an obese tending person, you need to realize that you are a different bird. Your hunger levels, metabolism, and appetite-satisfaction feedback systems differ from those of non-obese people. Weight management is physiologically a calorie energy in and calorie energy out equation, and that’s a hard fact. That's why SGs and related pharmaceutical solutions are (to me) such a Godsend. They shut up the brain chemicals generating ""food noise"", and let you stay on track without hunger pressing on you all the time.

2: Doing meal prep for lunch and dinner meals. Having tasty, nutritious meals ready to be heated up in the home or work fridge **AT HAND** when you are hungry is half the battle in controlling intake. If you have to rely on fast food or restaurants for lunch and dinner, you will always be forced to make expensive, bad decisions. Small, stand-alone freezers aren't wildly expensive and can be hugely helpful in meal planning.

3: Exercise is great for you, but you cannot out-exercise overeating. Controlling intake is 90%+ of the battle in losing weight.

4: Don't overestimate what your caloric burn rate is in determining a reasonable calorie deficit intake level. If you are genetically and naturally obese-tending, your caloric maintenance burn rate for a given weight is likely to be in the range of 9-11 calories per lb of body weight, per day, not 12-15 calories as some online calculators would have you believe.

5: Don't try to be a calorie-deficit hero and go super low on a calorie intake level to try to shed weight quickly. Extreme starvation intake levels across more than a day or so will mess with both your body and your mental acuity and can be quite dangerous. Your body will also ramp up trying to sabotage your starvation-level diet plan because it thinks you are dying, and will flood your brain with hunger-inducing chemicals. This extreme starvation state also negatively affects your ability to pay attention and can make you a danger to yourself and others. A sustainable loss level is around 1-2 lbs per week for most people. Sustainability is the key.

6: Don't get depressed or offended because no one is complimenting you on losing what you think is a good chunk of weight. People don't pay nearly as much attention to you as you might think. People have a sort of mental template image in their mind's eye as to what you look like. They are only going to notice weight loss if it's substantial enough to dramatically challenge that template. This could be a required loss of 30-70 lbs, depending on your initial body size.

7: The time to really buckle up and stop eating is after 8 PM. Use miso soup, diet soda, a few hard candies, tea, a bag of broccoli, or whatever tricks you need to get to bed without doing an evening pig out. Sleep will collapse your hunger, and you will wake the next morning not feeling bloated and awful, or hungry.

8: Fat in food is not your enemy. Eating fat and protein is actually more satisfying and provides satiety for longer periods of time than eating carbohydrates. Fat in reasonable amounts is a perfectly healthy part of a balanced diet. Eating high glycemic carbs in foods with flour or sugar is actually more of a risk, as it’s a big appetite driver and leads directly to overeating. Breads, pastas, and other flour-based foods are delicious, but they are dangerous appetite stimulants for people who have hunger issues.

9: Be wary in going to parties. Alcohol, while dieting is not your buddy, and combined with rich, high-calorie-density party foods, can make staying on track very difficult. Eating a moderate, low-calorie,  filling snack before going can help you stay in check.

10: If you fall off the wagon and have an over-the-top calorie blowout, don't succumb to the temptation to try and starve yourself the next day to make up for it. It will only make things worse. Take the hit, pick yourself back up, and return to your normal moderate deficit daily intake. One or two blowout days will make little difference over the long run of a diet. Starving yourself will only make you depressed and angry, and throw you into the ditch where you will give up. Moderation and sustainability are the key.

11: I'm not a big fan of ""cheat days"". Throwing all those calories into your system resets your appetite to want to overeat. It also stretches your stomach out and makes you doubly hungry when you restrict the calories back down, and that expanded stomach wants to be filled up to maximum capacity again. This makes the struggle to control your appetite all the more difficult when you restrict your calories back to a deficit level.",58.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1oldzhs/some_dieting_tips_guidelines_i_have_found_useful/,Nanny_Ogg1000,2025-10-31 20:27:16,7.0,post,,,

I increased to 1.5mg for 2 months, which helped a bit, but it still wasn’t as effective as the initial experience. 

I decided to try taking a break for a couple months to see if it would help reset my tolerance, but at 6 weeks I realized that the contrast between less effective and completely unmedicated was quite substantial, so I started back at .5mg two weeks ago. 

I’m still way more interested in carbs (bread and chocolate lol) than I was for the first 16 months, and possibly even more than before starting semaglutide—I was more of a salt and fat snacker before, but it seems to have completely shifted. It’s very strange. 

I don’t think my tolerance fully reset, but maybe the combination of a bit of a reset along with experiencing such a drastic difference in and off has made 0.5mg effective enough that I’m going to stay here for a while and accept that I need to put a little more effort into eating mindfully, so I have more room to dose up later if tolerance builds back. 

Interestingly, the break also revealed that the semaglutide was substantially helping reduce my arthritis pain, so going back on was an extra relief.",1.0

i will admit that i've gone more than a bit sugar-monster lately, and i'm thinking that the re-introduction of processed sugar has messed up something in the metabolic balance i'd created, creating the need for a higher dose.

semaglutide,1oks5bj,One Day At A Time - 28lbs Down,"SW: 254lbs CW: 226lbs GW: 180
July 2025 to October 2025

I already did a lot of food fasting prior to the semaglutide shots but started looking at the little things I was eating that would have been contributing to weight gain. I found out a large iced coffee 5 to 6 times a week was really setting my sugar levels 3 to 4x the amount an average women was supposed to have in a week. So I stopped completely and will have a small ice coffee here and there as a treat but a basic coffee not the fancy sugary ones 😊.

Had my 3rd daughter Jan. 2025 and couldn't stand seeing my belly with high waist pants as I looked like a snowman 😂. I drink way more water and carry a big tumbler with me to avoid quick store drinks. More chicken and less packaged food.

You would think after losing almost 30lbs my clothes would be baggy but it made me realize I was tricking myself into a certain size for awhile. Hence the feeling like a snowman ⛄. 


I went through goodlifemeds for compound semaglutide and first payment was $197 then second vial at $299. I just started on the second vial and will be on my 4 month next Wednesday.

I will say I'm doing this mostly to get my belly back to its form but I'm not really going for a weight number.

semaglutide,1olkhhj,Anyone else struggling to keep up with intense workouts on Wegovy? Nausea kills me halfway through,"Hey everyone!  

I've been on semaglutide and similar for a while now. I started with Saxenda, and now I’m on Wegovy (to help me feel full) plus Mysimba (to curb my sweet tooth). This month I went up from 1 to 1.7 Wegovy (second week on this dose). It’s amazing for appetite control as I feel full all the time - well, sometimes even to the point when I feel nauseous even after having one sandwich. 

The problem is, I’ve been playing squash for about 10 years at a pretty intense level, and since I increased the Wegovy dose, things got tough. After about 35–40 minutes of play, I hit a wall and feel like I might throw up if I keep going.  

I’m trying to figure out if it’s because I constantly feel full or because I eat too little and don’t have enough energy. The issue is, I can’t eat more without getting even more nauseous — it’s a vicious cycle.  

Has anyone else experienced this? How do you deal with nausea or low energy when doing high-intensity sports while on Wegovy or similar meds?  

**tl;dr** I'm on Wegovy and can’t handle a full hour of intense cardio training like I used to due to nausea. How do you guys manage this?",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1olkhhj/anyone_else_struggling_to_keep_up_with_intense/,Espressobytom,2025-11-01 03:29:08,5.0,post,,,

Just enough without making me too full and fights off the hungry nausea. Ginger chews can help. Sometimes even just a cracker.

I’m a few weeks into using Wegovy (GLP-1) and honestly feeling pretty positive so far. The appetite changes have helped loads, and now I’m trying to sort out the lifestyle habits side of things ,eating better, moving more, and just staying consistent.


Lately I’ve been looking for diet ideas that actually work while on GLP-1.

Did you find high-protein helpful? Smaller meals? Certain foods that made the side effects easier? I’m still figuring out what my body prefers, especially on days when the nausea sneaks in.


I’ve been reading some blogs on my provider’s page (shemed) just to get a sense of what others do , nothing promotional, just browsing through different perspectives. But I’d really love to hear from real people actually living this day-to-day.

Any tips, routines, meal ideas, or things you wish you knew earlier would be super appreciated. 😊

⸻

🧠 Human Starvation Timeline

Timeframe	Primary Energy Source	Body Processes & Changes	Common Symptoms
0 – 24 hours	Glucose → Glycogen (from liver & muscles)	Body uses stored glycogen for quick energy. Blood sugar drops as glycogen depletes.	Hunger, weakness, irritability, lightheadedness, fatigue.
1 – 3 days	Transition to Fat	Liver converts fat to ketones for brain/muscle fuel. Early muscle breakdown for glucose.	Intense hunger, headaches, dizziness, dehydration risk if fluids are low.
4 – 10 days	Fat (Ketosis phase)	Fat becomes main energy source; metabolism slows to conserve energy. Protein breakdown minimal but increasing.	Hunger often fades, breath smells “fruity” (ketones), energy low, body temp drops.
11 – 20 days	Fat + Muscle (Protein catabolism begins)	Muscle tissue broken down to make glucose. Immune system weakens; organ stress begins.	Extreme fatigue, weakness, apathy, irritability, difficulty concentrating.
21 – 40 days	Fat stores nearly gone → Protein (organs, heart, immune cells)	Severe loss of lean mass. Organ shrinkage. Immune collapse.	Dizziness, confusion, swelling (edema), infections, heart irregularities.
40 – 70+ days	Protein (vital organs)	Heart, liver, and kidneys fail; electrolyte imbalance leads to cardiac arrest.	Hallucinations, inability to stand, severe dehydration, coma, death.


⸻

💧 If no water
	•	3–7 days survival typical.
	•	Kidneys fail first; blood pressure drops rapidly; death often from circulatory collapse.

⸻

⚕️ Summary
	•	With water only: roughly 45–70 days of survival in ideal conditions.
	•	Without water: usually under a week.
	•	Death comes not just from lack of calories, but from electrolyte imbalance and organ failure.

I have Hashimotos, Tachycardia and have gained 100 pounds over the course of 20 yrs due to metabolism woes. I take 2 medications for my heart. One to lower my heart rate and another to lower the HBP the other HBP medicine gives me. Yes, you read that correctly.  

I have been pre-diabetic for 15 yrs. Due to the fact that I am not officially diabetic, I had to jump significant hoops to get approved for Wegovy. I will continue to jump hoops every month to prove myself worthy. I have taken 2 shots. I have not lost weight. I expected this. 


Why am I angry? My heart rate is perfection now. Almost too low. My HRV is in the 100s from being in the 50s two weeks ago. My Dr/PCP yesterday told me, she would monitor me bcz I may need to lower my heart meds and maybe my Thyroid dose bcz it seems the Wegovy is allowing my body to slow the absorption of the meds. Yes, wonderful news. She even mentioned I may be able to get off of the heart meds in the future if this continues.

The problem is insurance refusing to pay for a medication that clearly can help with things other than diabetes. Why? Because we are getting healthier and in doing so pharmaceuticals are profiting less from our illnesses.

semaglutide,1ol6ju0,Belly,,,,No-Manufacturer-2425,2025-10-31 23:18:49,,comment,nmhubpk,"Look into yohimbine and the a2 receptor. The hormone resistant fat in the belly is the last to go because it has special receptors that store fat under stress even if you are starving. The yohimbine (WHEN FASTED!!!) will unlock this fat and you will burn it at the same rate as your regular hormone sensitive fat. In this way you can *technically* spot reduce fat but its not what you think it is. You are still burning it normally, but its not shut off and locked away from access by adrenaline.

The purpose of this hormone resistant fat is to supply a reserve so when we are starving to death and under great stress, we can still maintain fat even when in deep ketosis. Obviously, this mechanism is irrelevant in a first world country with modern agriculture.

If you want to tighten up your stomach, work your obliques (twist crunch), transverse abdominus (stomach vacuum), and quadratus lumborum (side bends). These will add lateral bulk to your waist stretching out your stomach flat and rotat your pelvis so your hip flanges don't stick out and draw attention.

At the end of the day loose skin is paper thin, so if you have thick folds, you still have fat to burn and when it is nolonger weighting down the skin, it will tighten up. I lost 120 lbs, and the skin does tighten if you support your collagen health to the maximum. **It just takes longer for collagen to remodel than it does to lose fat.**  I'm talking full supplement, lifestyle, and care regiments, you will see improvement. After that look into nonsurgical skin tightening such as red light and rf radioablation therapies. Worst case scenario, a BBL can work wonders especially if you have odd fat deposits from being overweight. The non surgical and lifestyle options can get you a 20 percent reduction and if you don't have large sheets of skin hanging, a 20% improvement can be the difference between feeling self conscious and self confident.",4.0

semaglutide,1oksego,Alcohol Consumption - Monthly stats this month,"I know I've ranted about this before but I just find it so fascinating.

So, this month, October 2025, I had 4 days where I had alcohol.  3 of those days I had 1 glass of wine (one), one of those days we went to a wedding and I had 2 beers (two).

Normally, before I was on semaglutide I would drink roughly 15 days a month.  I know this as I've kept records of my alcohol intake for years.  I would rarely if ever drink more than 15 days.  I would typically have one bottle of red wine as my drink of choice.

It is nothing short of amazing to me that I simply have no desire for it, or relatively no desire for it.  

Anyway, I just thought I'd mention it, again.  It is amazing to experience.  I would have never believed it if I hadn't experienced it myself.

I really think you have to stay focused on the prize, that prize being the weight loss.  Hopefully, that motivates you to continue on.  

My recommendations, start eating protein bars.  I eat Kirkland protein bars as they are low in sugar and fairly cheap.  I would make sure you eat something every 2-3 hours, not a lot but something.  Walk, get out and walk as often as you can.  Keep sugar in all its forms away.  Sugar will make you nauseous on this drug.  Keep sugar away in all its forms.

I'm not sure if you have been very focused on your health before as I know many have not.  I would stay focused on the goal of being healthier and happier in ways that you are unaware of today.

If they are not shipping to Ohio, it’s because Ohio is cracking down on making sure the c..pound pharmacies are sticking to the rules of 503a and 503b. If it isn’t in shortage status (currently the favorite GLP1 meds are not), the pharmacy is risking state licensure issues if they ship there.  Modifying dose or adding b12 is still essentially a copy.

Once you lose the first 10% or 15%, your biology enacts several mechanisms to ensure you don’t die from starvation. Because that’s what your body is designed to do by evolution, to survive frequent bouts of starvation.

Your metabolism slows, burning less calories at rest. Building muscle and growing also stops, because those activities burns too many calories.

Hormones for hunger increase dramatically, signaling to your brain to try much MUCH harder to find a source of food. And your exercise becomes much more efficient, burning less calories than before, despite moving the same amount.

This can go on for 3 weeks or 3 months. But it lasts however long your body is programmed to decide if you are in fact dying from a famine. Once your hormones determine there is no threat, then things go back to normal, until it senses the next significant drop in weight. Hence the process starts over again. 

Losing very slowly can help trick your body into not panicking as much from the weight loss.",2.0

semaglutide,1okrp39,Connection between allodynia and having less loose skin,"Hello! 
Like many people here, I too have felt that burning feeling on my skin during weight loss. 
Many people say that it’s just Ozempic side effect that only does bad stuff – makes you feel some pain.

However, I’ve noticed that for me that burning feeling occurred *only* where I would have loose skin, and I have none even though I’ve lost 30 lbs!(225 lbs -> 195 lbs)

Also most people I saw complaining about it usually mentioned exact locations where you would get loose skin after weight loss - arms tricep, bottom of belly, thighs, etc

So my theory is this: in most cases it’s just your body burning all the loose skin that otherwise would be hanging all over your body. 

Could you please fill this simple poll so we could see if there is correlation between allodynia and having less loose skin in this sub? Thanks!

semaglutide,1okbfnb,Improved Mental Health…but why??,"I’ve been taking a low dose of .25 the past few months. I had realized it has tremendously helped with my anxiety, which most times expresses itself as extreme irritability/feelings of rage. I went two weeks without an injection a couple of times and could feel myself going back to how I felt before semaglutide. The day after I take a dose, all those feelings go away. I can’t find much info on why this is. My mood is so stabilized on this drug. I no longer have constant racing thoughts. I’ve had the nervous habit of chewing the side of my mouth since I was a little girl. Since taking this drug the side of my mouth has completely healed and I don’t chew on it anymore…a habit I never thought I could break. I’m a single mom and my high energy 5 year old would trigger me nonstop and now I’m not triggered at all by him and I’m able to be a better mom. I don’t want to be on semagultide for forever so I’m trying to figure out exactly what’s happening so I can mimic what this drug goes/find other ways of helping my mental health.

semaglutide,1ok0xaw,Eating or not?,,,,WorkingChoice2252,2025-10-30 07:32:56,,comment,nm75gkx,"Little trick, you can get better results by thinking about what releases insulin rather than calories. Complex carbohydrates and fiber rich fruit and vegetables will cause much less weight gain than candy. Protein in the absence of carbs should not be restricted as it has far less effect on fat mass than carbs. Fats may be calorie dense, but they are satiating, take a long time to digest, and release no insulin.

If you lower your need for insulin in your diet you will not only have less signal to store energy as fat, you will also improve ypur insulin sensitivity and reduce your cravings for carbohydrates. This is the basis for why keto diets reduce appetite. At the same time, spending some time in low insulin states will train your body to go into mild ketosis more easily when fasting to burn fats.

You don't even need to adopt a restrictive keto diet to benefit from this advice, just don't feel bad eating healthy fats, proteins, and vegetibles to a reasonable amount as they will help you lose weight without sacrificing proper nutrition or your own sanity. It is much easier to focus on what foods you eat rather than how much you eat, and these whole foods will be so satiating your body can more easily learn how much it needs to eat.",4.0

I’m asking because I’m starting to lose hope with my semaglutide journey! I’m on week 14 and I’ve only lost 3 pounds. For context, I do have PCOS and insulin resistance. I’m currently taking the 1.25 mg dose and will be going up to the 2.0 mg soon. The NP with the company I get my medication from says that at this point, she suggests I switch from semaglutide to tirzepatide. I just really can not afford to make this switch right now. 

I have my 2.0 mg doses here already so I’m just going to finish out my 1.25, then switch to the 2.0 and see what happens. I’m really hoping the highest doses will be the breaking point for me to finally start losing. Did this happen to anyone else with the high doses? I just really need some optimism that it could still work for me, thank you!!

semaglutide,1okjy3w,Checked in With My Doctor Today,"I've been prescribed .5 mg of Zepbound.  I've taken three doses.  I started seeing this doctor specifically to get a prescription, but had not seen her before then.

This was our first check-in since I started.  I told her I'd had no effects.  I told her my appetite had been \*ravenous\*, and I hadn't weighed myself all month but from noticing the changes in my body and taking into account how many calories I've been eating (and not burning) I had gained significant weight this month.

She said that I might be frustrated on Zepbound because her other patients reported to her that the appetite suppressing effect came and went.  She said Zepbound's main purpose was to help regulate your weight by helping your blood sugar levels, not to suppress your appetite.  I said the appetite suppressing effect was really what I needed because I am never not hungry, and it's been that way my whole life.  I asked if a different semaglutide would help suppress my appetite more.  She kind of shrugged it off and said I should stick with Zepbound.  She asked if I had tried a healthier diet.  I've been trying healthier diets my whole life, I get too hungry to stick to them.  She said she was upping my dose to 5 mg starting the week after next.

I found this discouraging, a) because I'm fatter than ever, b) what she said about Zepbound not suppressing appetite that much, c) I didn't even know there was a 5 mg option.  I thought the next dose up was 7 mg.  I'm scared that dose is too small to do anything and before I know it I'll be up another 50 lbs. d) including this month's and next month's dose I'll have spend close to $ 1k out of pocket \*hyperventilate\*.  Half the cost is coming out of my savings.  The other half is coming out budgeting my money differently. e) what if she never ups my dose again and I never get any benefit from Zepbound?

semaglutide,1okjy3w,Checked in With My Doctor Today,,,,Vegetable-Onion-2759,2025-10-30 20:51:09,,comment,nmbc6si,"I'm a prescriber.  First, go to the Zepbound website and learn what the doses are for this drug.  There are some services, like RO, that sell microdose versions of this drug, but if you are taking name-brand Zepbound, there is no .5 dose.  There is also no 7 mg dose. It's really important that you relay doses and the diet you are following accurately, otherwise no one can offer any suggestions for you without it being a complete guess.

It is likely, if your doctor is reputable, that you were prescribed the starting dose of 2.5 mg.  A lot of people don't lose weight on this dose.  It is considered non-therapeutic.  Also, this drug is a GLP-1 drug but it is not semaglutide.  Semaglutide is Wegovy and Ozempic.  Zepbound (and Mounjaro) are tirzepative.

You also didn't provide any starting weight or current weight information, so none of can understand what you consider significant weight gain.

If you are taking the drug correctly and are following a diet that produces a calorie deficit of at least 500 calories per day, and getting regular exercise that is challenging at least three times a week, you will lose weight.  This drug (if you are indeed taking Zepbound) does not cause weight gain.  Eating too many calories causes weight gain. You are the only person that can control how many calories you eat every day.  And while the 2.5 mg dose may not deliver a lot of appetite suppression for a very few, it would be extremely unusual for you not to experience appetite suppression on the next dose up, which is 5 mg.

Ask your doctor for a referral to a dietician or nutritionist and get a solid eating plan together that you follow every day.  Start tracking calories so that you can stop eating before you spur weight gain.  Ask if there are programs you can join at your local gym, or a walking group you can join, or a friend who can be a walking buddy, so that you are committed to regular exercise.

The drug will not lose weight for you, but you need to get things in order and follow a plan if you expect to see any weight loss.  When you are paying out of pocket, it just makes no sense to leave these things to chance.",41.0

I am so proud of myself. I couldn’t believe it once I stepped on the scale. 🤩🤩 my weight is finally going down. The thing is I have to be patient. I increase my semaglutide dose every month. Hopefully by December I’ll be on 1 mg I won’t give up I’m gonna continue to do what I do. I now realize all of our bodies are different and we all won’t lose weight the same.  Several factors like height, age, weight, how much you exercise, and eating habits determines how much weight you lose. When I decided to go on this journey I wanted my journey to be slow and steady. 

One thing I noticed about my body is that my thighs are getting slimmer my thigh fat isn’t rubbing against each other chaffing, I notice my arms are getting slimmer. My stomach is very stubborn I’m gonna have to do standing abs workouts which works the full body but engages the core. I tried to do a workout yesterday but had to stop at the ten minutes mark because I was super exhausted and tired. Winter season is coming up so I probably wont be able to walk for an hour and a half anymore. I’ll stick to indoor workouts which is easy. It’s been really windy here in Texas and a little cool in the morning and evenings. 

But yes I’m losing weight yay! 😀  76 more pounds to go! 😊 ",31.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1ojklch,TBrown_25,2025-10-29 16:47:42,13.0,post,,,

semaglutide,1okd9tl,Ok it's been 4 wks and I've already plateaued (if not gained a little weight),"Edit: forgot to mention it's 300g gained over four days, I think I'm being a little neurotic about it  

I'm on a starter dose of 0.5 mg. 

I lost a few at first, my food drive is substantively lower, etc. It's good. 

That said, over a week or 2 I've gained a  little weight. 

One explanation is that I'm very uh ""slowed down"" in terms of how long things take to go through my GI, such that there is maybe a bit of water weight going on. I had a rare binge yesterday and had 4 meals, so all that weight is still amidst me lol. 

Another is that, while my food drive is continuously lower (which is nice in itself because I don't get fat guy anxiety anymore lol), I've been eating too much. That's less plausible than it sounds because I'm on next to zero fast food, HOWEVER I have been having full sugar cola + a lot of bread. Now my food drive is pretty well managed but I do think I'm getting hungrier again.  

It's probably a combination of things but I'm going to log what I'm eating, with rough estimates at least. I'm for sure gonna push myself there.",0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1okd9tl/ok_its_been_4_wks_and_ive_already_plateaued_if/,sneakysnek20r,2025-10-30 15:10:09,14.0,post,,,

For me personally, even sugar free soda messes me up now, it makes me bloat. Up your water intake, that’s going to help with the water weight. Upping water intake is also going to help with hunger, because often times we mistake dehydration for being hungry, when really you just need more fluids. If you’re not a fan of plain water, get some sugar free water flavoring packs, it helps. Start tracking calories with an app. Even if you’re only eating 3 meals a day, you’d be surprised that even just 3 meals can still be over a calorie deficit depending on what you’re eating within those 3 meals.

semaglutide,1ok4opw,Anyone else get semi-frequent Gas/Vomiting/Diarrhea??,"Hi!

I'm a 32/f and I started taking semaglutide for about a year ago now. I started really well and took all my vitamins, probiotics, everything to help my gut through this. It wasnt until a couple months in that I would call my first ""episode"", I thought it was really bad indigestion but I had a lot of trapped gas, stomach discomfort (not pain, but more like a pressure) and vomiting so much I had to go to the hospital- they checked me and said i was fine (no meds worked btw I still left the hospital w discomfort but went away later that night)

From that point, I was paranoid and made a GI appt and they told me to get a colonoscopy/endoscopy. Those came back normal expect for mild gastritis which makes sense for me, I thought I had IBS before the meds but was able to control what eat more and track what would inflame my stomach.

So from there, I had about two more episodes but not as bad as the first one- but same thing --- diarrhea, nausea, trapped gas some stomach discomfort and like mild vomiting til I have one HUGE vomit. I went to the GI again, she said this is a side effect of my GLP1 and just to start taking omeprazole before dinner since these episodes always happen before bed or in the middle of the night.

Since then, I havent been good with taking my omeprazole since I dont think it does anything. but since then its happened like 4-5 more times and the last one was last night. It was just so bad, it usually takes me out for the next day and I have to call out of work cause ill be up for like 2 hours in the bathroom and lose sm sleep. I dont know if it's indigestion or just like a bad reaction. I also noticed it happens with whatever i've eaten that day so theres no real pattern.

I'm to the point where im about to quit this because this is ruining my gut! I was on this medication because my lexapro makes me gain weight and hard to lose weight so this medication has REALLY helped and also helped me from going from pre-diabetic & high cholesterol to REALLY GOOD blood work.

I guess im asking if anyone else has gone through these kind of symptoms?! What did you do to ease it? Higher fiber intake or did anything work? I really dont want to get off this because it has helped me tremendously but if this is what its going to be like then i shouldnt be putting my body through this.",1.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1ok4opw/anyone_else_get_semifrequent_gasvomitingdiarrhea/,Groundbreaking-Run-5,2025-10-30 09:39:29,19.0,post,,,

semaglutide,1ojqt7q,"Been comparing GLP-1 providers for ages , found one with a Halloween deal, worth it? Looking for real experiences","Hey all 👋
I’ve been searching around for a decent UK GLP-1 provider for what feels like forever , reading every Reddit post, scrolling Trustpilot, even asking people in DMs 😅. Most of the prices have been a bit much, so I’ve been putting it off.
Today my bestie mentioned that shemed has a small Halloween price drop ,  from £79 down to £75 for first-time users. It’s not massive, but honestly, it’s the first time it’s felt within reach for me.
Has anyone here actually used them? I’ve heard they’re pretty good with support and follow-up, but I’d love to hear real experiences , how quick they are with prescriptions, whether the meds arrive sealed and on time, and if their customer service is decent.
Trying to decide if now’s the time to finally get started while the price is lower. Any honest feedback would be really appreciated! 🎃",3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1ojqt7q/been_comparing_glp1_providers_for_ages_found_one/,OfferFeisty733,2025-10-29 21:50:40,5.0,post,,,

semaglutide,1oivg72,GLP-1 weight-loss drugs linked to sharply lower risk of early macular degeneration in non-diabetics,"A new cohort study in JAMA Ophthalmology reports one of the most striking associations yet between systemic weight-loss therapy and eye disease prevention.

Study – JAMA Ophthalmology https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamaophthalmology/article-abstract/2840121

Everyday Health summary

https://www.everydayhealth.com/eye-vision-health/glp-1-weight-loss-drugs-tied-to-lower-risk-of-early-macular-degeneration/

Researchers followed over 91,000 adults aged 55+ with overweight or obesity but no diabetes for up to 10 years, comparing those prescribed GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, semaglutide, etc.) with users of other weight-loss drugs.

Key results: • Over a 10-year period, GLP-1 users had a 91% lower risk of developing early (dry) age-related macular degeneration (AMD). • The association was strong and consistent at 5, 7, and 10 years (HRs ≈ 0.16 → 0.09). • There was no increased risk of progression to the advanced exudative (wet) form once early disease was present. • The protective signal persisted after adjusting for BMI, smoking, hypertension, and other covariates.

Why this matters: No prior drug — ocular or systemic — has ever been associated with such a profound reduction in AMD incidence. If verified, this could represent the first pharmacologic strategy shown to substantially prevent early AMD, linking metabolic modulation directly to retinal health.

Bottom line: GLP-1 receptor agonists may be doing far more than reducing weight. They could be the first medications ever associated with a population-scale decrease in AMD risk — a potential paradigm shift at the intersection of metabolic and ocular medicine.",107.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1oivg72/glp1_weightloss_drugs_linked_to_sharply_lower/,newsdude11,2025-10-28 21:36:45,17.0,post,,,

semaglutide,1ojswj8,"Wegovy vs Mounjaro, curious what people actually think works better long term","So I came across this [article](https://www.thesun.co.uk/health/37162209/best-fat-jab-long-term-weight-loss-wegovy-mounjaro) comparing Wegovy and Mounjaro, and it got me thinking. Both are doing similar things in terms of how they work, but the way people respond seems really personal.

From what I’ve [read](https://pharmacy4you.co.uk/the-ultimate-fat-jab-showdown-wegovy-vs-mounjaro-which-one-actually-works-for-good/), Mounjaro might help you lose a bit more on average, but Wegovy’s been around longer and feels a bit more predictable side-effect-wise. Personally, I’ve been on Wegovy for a few months and it’s definitely helped,  not just with weight but with curbing the constant food noise. But it does make me wonder if Mounjaro would feel any different in day-to-day life, especially with energy or hunger levels.

I’m curious, has anyone here tried both or switched from one to the other?

Then I started researching GLP-1 options and came across Zevay. Honestly, it’s been a game-changer. I’ve lost about 40 lbs so far, and it’s not just about the numbers my cravings have dropped, and I feel like I finally have some control over my eating habits.

Of course, I also made some lifestyle changes going to the gym three times a week and cutting down on sugar but having something that helps “turn off the food noise” in my head has made it way easier to stick to those changes.

semaglutide,1oj2i9b,Rybelsus no longer working for me..feeling a bit lost (UK),"Hey all,

I’ve been on Rybelsus for about a year a half now, initially I lost over 30lbs and boy was I delighted. I felt in control, I felt a freedom around food I’d never had before and genuinely my confidence was so much better.

I am in the Uk, so this was prescribed for me by the diabetic consultant (I am type 2 diabetic) and my Hba1c control went from being super high, to completely normal - my diabetes was marked as resolved (yay!).

Now a few months later after starting the 14mg, my appetite suppression started to fade away, I felt less in control and I started to gain a little weight. Forward to now I’ve gained even more weight, I feel so out of control and so lost and I’m genuinely struggling so much with it.

I approached the consultant who prescribed this initially quite a few times, and they will not move me to mounjaro or any other weight loss Injection because my Hba1c control is still perfect. I should be happy about this aspect, but it’s so hard for me to see it this way at the moment.

Diet changes are very hard for me, I am autistic and have very few safe foods, most of which unfortunately seems to be carbs (pasta, bread, cheese etc). I have been doing my 10k steps a day, and doing jump rope work outs for 30 mins per day too. The scale is not changing, in fact it is going up.

I feel so hopeless now, something that once changed my life has just gone in the blink of an eye. I also have gallstones as a result of the rapid weight loss at the beginning of Rybelsus, which means getting it prescribed privately would be difficult too (alongside the already existing NHS prescription that won’t change).

Any advice or even experiences from people I similar situations would be so appreciated.

Thanks. ",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1oj2i9b/rybelsus_no_longer_working_for_mefeeling_a_bit/,Happy_Department8033,2025-10-29 04:56:26,8.0,post,,,

I started tracking my macros with an app, maintaining a 500 calorie deficit, and started losing weight again. In my case, the appetite suppression was just enough to help with the deficit, even though like you it had faded quite a bit. I just switch to Mounjuro and it has helped me to maintain a 1200 calorie deficit for the last bit of weight I want to lose, so I would keep asking. It also helps with Hba1c control, probably better than Rybelsus from what I have read, so the response by your provider is a bit surprising.

As a T2D, you really need to watch the carbs, even though the medication helps to recover with the blood glucose spikes, you're still more sensitive to that type of food. If you don't already, start tracking your blood glucose levels after eating that type of stuff to see how it impacts you. For me, when I do eat something like pizza or pasta, I get a huge spike, and then after a few hours it very suddenly just drops back to normal. Good luck.",2.0

For sure -- you had a medication that was treating two conditions at once -- but the secondary (and equally important portion) isn't working anymore.  

With Rybelsus, they do say it will get your A1C into a good range. Which it did... But part of how it did that was helping with weight loss among other things.  I hope you find a good solution. I don't have anything to offer here except empathy and support.   

For what it's worth, Mounjaro is the T2D version of that med, and is dosed the same way Zepbound is, which means theoretically, it could achieve the same results as Zepbound. Maybe the rules will get a refresh soon.

However, maintaining licensure requires that they follow state and federal laws. By manufacturing/selling medications that are not on the shortage list (503a/503b), they are risking their license. 

They may claim that it's tied up in court - which it arguably could be for a while, but the FDA has stated: 

\- Changing the dose amount or schedule;

\- Adding something to it (b12 for example); 

are both still essentially a copy of the patented medication and are not allowed.

The folks who say they need a customized/personalized dose need to have clinical documentation of why the commercial version (Wegovy) doesn't work for them.  But the key there is most of these people have not tried the commercially available version first to support that documentation with evidence. (I.e. I can't claim to have an allergic reaction to a medication I've never taken.)

semaglutide,1oi46kw,Getting in shape is expensive…. but so was my mental health,"So here’s my story , I’ve officially hit my “desirable weight” (whatever that means lol), thanks to my best buddy GLP-1. 
But honestly…. The journey here was WILD.
 It started with:
 “Can’t wear that dress, I’ll look like a sausage.”
 ➡️ sadness
 ➡️ binge eating
 ➡️ more fat
 ➡️ health issues
 ➡️ repeat until you accidentally become a walking circle.
And THEN people are like, “Just love yourself!” , which is great advice unless you’re trying to love yourself while your jeans are plotting your murder.
So yeah, I finally said screw it, went on GLP-1 (through SheMed), and now it’s working like the friend who actually texts back and stops you from eating a family-size pizza because you’re “just a little stressed.”
Not gonna lie though…. getting in shape is pricey. But so was therapy for my food guilt and body image. At this point, I’m just financially committed to feeling okay.
Anyway, I’m not here to promote anything , just to say if you’ve ever cried in a Zara changing room, I see you. 🙃

*What's changed?*

I don't cry before leaving the house anymore because nothing fits or I feel like a bulging swamp monster with a dunlap. Now, I can go out in my ""given up on life pants"" and still feel great about how I look. I don't hide behind makeup anymore, I don't even feel like I need it, as I feel good enough about my appearance as I am. 

Funny how losing 100 lbs felt like gaining self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-worth. I lost weight and gained the superpower of going into public and not feeling like people are staring at me because of my size or my self-loathing. 

I spent many years overcompensating because of all the fear that came with being fat. I missed so many opportunities and I was such a wallflower because I was afraid of judgement. However, it is probably a good thing I never knew what it was like to be thin before now, as my kindness towards others was shaped by years of always being the fat girl. 

*My big advice?* 

My advice isn't about any of the nuances involved with glp1s, it's about documenting your journey. Get right up in front when someone in the group holds up their cellphone to snap a pic. You'll cherish those photos, both because you will have something to judge your progress by... but also because you will have lived in the moment. 

Don't let the fear of being fat stop you from living.

Coming from someone who has been 100% about this life for an entire year: take selfies and ask others to snap your pics. Especially at the beginning, it will keep you motivated as you reflect on your journey.",388.0,https://v.redd.it/655rfiqygrxf1,1-900OkFace,2025-10-27 19:10:32,40.0,post,,,

semaglutide,1oipcge,"Symptoms just hit me like a train after 4 months of nothing, is this normal?","I have been on semiglutide for 4 months now. For the first three months, I upped my units every other week. This seemed to work great, I had super mild symptoms here and there, but it was smooth sailing.

About 4 weeks ago, I started my therapeutic dose of 30 units. The first few days of that first 30 unit shot was rough and I got sick a few times. The following week, I was on my period and had ZERO symptoms. For some reason the shot feels like it does nothing on my period weeks. 

Last week I got prescribed Zofran. I followed the advice, took it before the shot, drank lots of water, ate good…. And still brutally sick. Stomach cramps, diarrhea, vomiting. I got through it and hoped this week would be better, repeated the zofran and other advice. This week is the worst. I am struggling to keep things down, today I was to the point of throwing up bile.

Is this normal? Do I try to ride it out? Will it ease up?

I am injecting in my stomach and have been the whole time but I plan to switch to my thigh for my next shot. I just don’t know if I should lower the dose or tough it out.

semaglutide,1oibrwa,Those on Wegovy with high BP,,,,WorkingChoice2252,2025-10-28 16:55:38,,comment,nlx6nvx,"So I do have graduate training in biomedical sciences and work in diabetes care, but I tried to make my speculations from literature and personal experience accessible. Thank you for asking this question because I was very interested to see that I was not alone in experiencing such profound improvements in hypertension as I had (25-30 mmHg systolic). Unfortunately the best meta-analysis I could find showed a typical decrease closer to 5mmHg systolic over longer timespans than I have been on the drug \[1\].  
  
My blood pressure dropped rather quickly, from 130/84 on 20mg telmisartan (down from 143/92) to f123/80 on both to eventually reaching 116/72 with no blood pressure medication. I am on a high dose of stimulant medication and that may have reduced hypertensive effects because of the drug, but the interaction between the angiotensin receptor blocker becoming more potent on semaglutide before becoming unnecessary supports my hypothesis that reduced insulin levels reflecting an improved sensitivity and reduced need for it drive the antihypertensive effects more than weight loss.

This is because anyone who has ever done keto knows that in low insulin states lead to the loss of sodium and water through a diuretic effect. This happens because insulin has a complex interplay with the Renin-Angiotensin System through which insulin actually increases retention of sodium and water raising blood pressure. Reduced activity of the end hormone, angiotensin II, also improves vasodilation, but that is a secondary effect. Semaglutide actually works mostly by blocking glucagon release followed by gastric slowing, thus it can actually reduce glucose and insulin on the same timescale, and long term this can lead to restored insulin sensitivity and reduced insulin levels \[2\]. I believe that is likely the primary driver of potent antihypertensive effects, and probably more pronounced in some people than the average study participant.

I started semaglutide off-label for psychiatric uses, and found profound anxiety relief, antidepressant effects, and euphoria that caused me to titrate quickly, but at 31M 5'11"" and 192lbs starting and 175lbs when I stopped the blood pressure medication, I understand why literature seems to indicate the cardioprotective effects happen independently of weight loss. Given the way my BP creeps up in only two weeks without a dose, I certainly don't think weight loss is the primary driver of antihypertensive effects from personal experience either.  
  
Good luck, be patient, don't feel bad if you need blood pressure medication while waiting to see how big an effect you get from semaglutide, just watch for symptoms of dehydration and low blood pressure, or more immediate response to your blood pressure medication and if your numbers improve, reach out to your doctor about reducing the dose or discontinuing the antihypertensive. Just don't expect to discontinue semaglutide and maintain the same improvements in blood pressure without medication even if you maintain the weight-loss as it is likely not the primary driver for the most profound effects on hypertension.  
  
I hate to be a downer with the reminder than clinical studies show a much more mild typical reduction in blood pressure, but understanding this mechanism you can actually potentiate the antihypertensive effect of semaglutide by adopting a lower carb diet to further reduce your chronic insulin exposure and restore sensitivity. Unfortunately, you don't become come resistant to the hypertensive effects of insulin the same way as you do for glucose control, but the mechanisms are beyond the scope here.   
  
Fortunately for you the same metaanalysis that shows a 5mmHg average reduction in systolic blood pressure also mentions a reduction antihypertensive medications prescribed to patients on semaglutide, so that number is almost certainly an underestimate of its potential effect on blood pressure. In any case, you can expect a substantial cardioprotective effect from the drug and hopefully you can make other changes to improve your health, but that is between you and your doctor.

I have other vascular issues and have had surgery for varicose veins and also have hyperurecemia (gouty arthritis) so the likelihood of dumping them all probably won’t happen, but eventually getting rid of the diuretic since that can also increase uric acid, is one of my goals with Wegovy.

semaglutide,1oibrwa,Those on Wegovy with high BP,,,,Fandrel64,2025-10-29 05:06:51,,comment,nlzstzg,"I started .25 the beginning of April. I was pre-diabetic and had high BP my cholesterol and triglycerides were through the roof and I was put on a fluid pill and a BP pill and a statin the month prior. May .5, June 1.0, In July I had lost enough weight and adjusted a lot of things like my diet and exercise that my BP was being maintained by my BP med alone and was taken off the fluid pill. Last week of July 1.7. In Aug I went off the BP pill as well and as of this month I am no longer pre-diabetic. This Friday will be shot #28. The math doesn’t math for shots vs weeks because I had a couple of skipped weeks in there for different reasons. It wasn’t easy and it took a ton of work but the Wegovy certainly helped me to make the changes I needed to make. I’m down about 50lbs, I’m strength training 5 days a week most weeks, walking/jogging 4 miles 3 days a week most weeks and rowing 30 minutes 3 days a week most weeks and signed up to do a 5k on Saturday whereas this time last year I couldn’t walk a mile without being winded. I did 22+ years in the Army so was always running and exercising but the last few years I was in were a struggle to maintain weight. I retired with a number of lingering physical issues. In the 20+ years after I got out I ate another me and was knocking on the door to 300lbs. Now I’m half way to my 200lb goal and still dropping. I’ll be 62 in March.",3.0

Going in for a check up in about 14 days, but i can feel its down some. 

Noticed it was lower after about 3-4 weeks (now on week 8), but not sure exactly where its at tho. 

Only thing i now notice is some bp drops when standing up sometimes, but that is quite common on Wegovy. 
Could be to little water intake, low electrolyte, to much calorie deficiency etc etc.",2.0

My BP was pretty well controlled on Lisinopril. I started Semaglutide in February. By April, my BP was so low that my doc wanted to admit me to the ER. We compromised and I received a couple infusions and we stopped the Lisinopril and stopped or reduced my diuretics and prescription electrolytes. My BP has been perfect since. I've been able to eliminate 14 pills from my daily regimen thanks to Semaglutide. .",2.0
