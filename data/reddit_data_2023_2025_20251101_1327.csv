NAFLD,,1ogk2ec,How did this happen?,"24 yr old; F; 5'7"" 165 pounds. High alkaline phosphatase (144) led to an ultrasound which diagnosed me with NAFL. I'm 6 months postpartum, and during my last blood test and ultrasound when I was pregnant my liver was completely normal. I also passed the 1 hr glucose test which checks for gestational diabetes. The doctor who quickly diagnosed me with NAFL last week told me to see my primary dr to test for type 2 diabetes as l am really not THAT over weight and don't drink. Here's the kicker - my diet is awful. I live off of sugars, carbs, and processed foods. Is it possible I just developed NAFL in the last 6 months purely because of my diet?
I'll go through with getting tested for diabetes but this time last year I passed a glucose test and really don't have any symptoms of diabetes?

NAFLD,,1nvq5tr,Please help. I need some info.,"Hi guys,

I'm reall concerned here. Please go through this.

I’ve had tinea barbae for about 18 months. It’s localized but hasn’t cleared despite 5 months of topical antifungals (miconazole and ketoconazole). From what I’ve read, oral antifungals are usually required, so I’m considering terbinafine.

Here’s my situation:

Back in July, my ALT was 111, which normalized to 28 within a month and has stayed normal.

No known chronic liver disease.

I’m concerned about terbinafine’s potential effect on the liver.

Transferrin levels recently improved (went from <2 to 2.2 g/L). I’m not sure if this is relevant, but I’m just adding it for context.


Questions:

1. With normal liver function tests now, is it generally safe to start terbinafine?



2. If terbinafine (or any othe oral fungal medication) affects my liver in any way, will it almost always return to normal after stopping? Do I need to worry about serious or life-threatening damage?


3. If I don’t go on oral medication, and topical treatments aren’t helping, what alternatives exist? Is there any realistic way to clear tinea barbae without oral antifungals?

4. How much risk do I have of developing jaundice while on terbinafine, and what precautions or warning signs should I monitor to prevent it?


5. Will it casue death ? I've heard something about it affecting hormones and other things in the body some way. Please let me know I'm really concerned. Should i skip it ? How else do i cure this fungal infection ?

NAFLD,,1my7dix,What does onset timeframe typically look like?,"I’m a 32 year old female dealing with a host of health issues, including something autoimmune that’s being investigated but not yet treated. 

My ALT has been elevated off and on for a few years now, but the highest reading was mid 60’s and no doctor was even mildly concerned. My AST was always within a normal range. 

My ALT and AST looked good this spring and then I had a CMP done on 7/22 that showed both labs were in the mid 20’s, which is the best I’d seen them in a long while! However, I had another CMP done ordered through my dermatologist so that we could trial Humira for my HS and (potentially) RA. My ALT came back in the 120’s and AST was in the 70’s. I’d been having pain in my stomach, back, and right side, but that wasn’t super out of the ordinary for me with all the symptoms I’ve suffered from for the last several years. I asked my primary care and she said that it fluctuates sometimes and it probably didn’t mean anything. I asked if I could have an ultrasound of my liver. I just got those results in the patient portal and it was pretty unremarkable except a mild fatty liver (in more medical terms). 

Is it common for that rapid of a spike even with just “mild” fatty liver? I do not drink alcohol, but my regular supplements include magnesium citrate and/or taurate daily, vitamin D 10000 iu maybe twice per week to help maintain after overcoming a deficiency, a half of a dose of methylated b complex daily, and I had started taking krill oil to help with my inflammation, though I’ve held off just in case that is an unexpected contributor. I also had an iron infusion the Friday before these test results, but my doctor told me it’s unrelated.

NAFLD,,1msd9ee,Help with next steps,"Hi,
Late in 2024, they suspected a NAHFD via an ultrasound. Immediately, I changed my diet, removing sugars, processed foods, and bringing down carbs. I increased my exercise and activity level in general. All blood tests have come back okay, except ALT that has fluctuated slightly above the max. Fibroscan came back negative, and I have no diagnosis. I lost a few pounds, but I wasn’t terribly obese, so my results seemed to be accurate. 

Fast forward to today, my lab came back with my ALT a slightly higher than before but also another marker (MCHC) is slightly low. 

I understand that many of us have perfect blood tests but have been diagnosed. My question may be more for those in a similar situation like mine. Has anyone has faced the same results? Has somethingb come up at a later time? What would you recommend that I should do?

Instead, my mother continued for years with these numbers just a little off until the liver disease advanced to the point of ascites, which landed her in the ER. On that first ER visit, they removed 14 liters of fluid from her abdomen. She was also type 2 diabetic, so she saw her dr every 3 months for management of that condition, and at no point did anyone say, hey you’ve got signs of worsening liver damage and you’re headed towards cirrhosis.

I guess my PCOS is that bad, that a GLP1 may be my only option. It’s been mentioned to me by every doctor I have that’s involved in knowing my fatty liver diagnosis. However, I’m the person who gets the rare and really bad side effects from almost any medication. I’m worried the side effects, both short term and long term, from a GLP-1 will be worse than me trying to do it a natural way by being stricter with my diet and exercise. 

I guess I’m just posting for support or advice. I’m kind of at a loss.  I would love to hear of your experience with a GPL-1 and which one it is you’re taking. I would also be happy to look at any social media content or other resources you recommend.

In the ten years I have developed diabetes and high cholesterol. (Note that many times this comes before a NASH diagnosis). On meds for both and keep them in check with good blood test numbers. 

Lots of people weighing in with drugs to take, but you can improve your diet and improve your numbers. Take vitamin E, ten years ago my liver doc said this was all he could tell me to do. BTW a few years later when I did a follow up with him when my numbers spiked, he was rude and said “I already told you what to do, there is nothing else, do it or don’t, but I can’t help you”.

Grains turn into sugar, so they are part of the problem. And many doctors also include saturated fat in that list of things to limit.

I've definitely been trying to add more protein and fiber to my diet. I take clear protein almost every day, especially when I go to the gym, and have been trying to find high-protein meals. I also take a multivitamin every day, and have these men's health supplement packs with stuff like omega 3 fatty acid, zinc and selenium which it says are good for liver health that I got from a local nutrition shop that I trust, but I keep neglecting to take them because it's like 5 pills and every time I take one my stomach lurches lol 

I have a meal subscription service that I won't name for fear of it being considered advertising or something lol, but I tend to look for the carb smart and high protein meals there. Not sure how much longer I'll be able to afford it tho.

Recently, I've been following this one creator on YouTube called Liam who does a lot of nutrition and health stuff. Gotten a couple really good recipes from him. Recently tried a recipe he reviewed of tortilla pizza wraps with Caesar salad, and they were SO good. I used a high fiber, high protein tortilla, which was amazing to find out existed lol

I'm still not sure at what stage I'm at with my fatty liver, so I don't know what medications or anything I'd even qualify for. I guess we'll find out after I see the specialist and probably have to go for an ultrasound.

I also get a burning sensation that lasts a few seconds in the right abdomen and sometimes in the left stomach area.

But anyways blood work was clear, then finally decided to do a abominal ultrasound and we found out I had a fatty liver. (NAFLD) Glad we found that cause I thought I was going crazy. 

Does anyone get those symptoms above that I listed as well? I notice the symptoms all come and go. Days I feel alright and there are some that I don't feel the greatest. I don't know if me cheating on the diet a bit is what causes it to come back.

NAFLD,,1lbes80,Possibly benign lesion and enlarged liver found during ultrasound.,"



35F uk. Hi, I've been struggling with abdominal pain for 4 weeks now, it started on the right like a wave like pain and then gradually became a widespread pain across the abdomen and sometimes radiating to the back. The one thing that bothers me the most is the bloating and fullness feeling I have all day like something is inflamed. At first they thought it was UTI/kidney stones due to microscopic blood in urine but ct was clear. 

Pain is ongoing and getting worse (uncomfortable specially after dinner!)  so I booked a private ultrasound. Ultrasound found liver lesion and enlargement. 

Here are the findings:

""Liver is enlarged in size and shows diffusely increased echogenecity, consistent with fatty infiltration. 

A well defined hypechoic lesion is identified showing internal vascularity in colour Doppler imaging. The lesion appears solid and circumscribed, with mo associated billiard dilatation or evidence of ascites measuring 14 x 12 x 14. 

Sonographic features are suggestive of a benign hepatic lesion, most likely focal nodular hypoplasia or a hepatic adenoma.""

For those who have this lesion and enlargement of the liver, could you please share the following:

Your symptoms
What helped you and how to manage it
Further investigations 

When I search it on Google it says lesions are normally asymptomatic so not sure why I'm in a lot of discomfort 😭. I had transvaginal, abdominal and pelvic scan so everything was normal except for my liver.

I don't drink but my diet wasn't great so I guess that caused my fatty liver. I do wonder as well if my endo affects my liver, sometimes it plays in my mind. Nhs is frustratingly so slow though. I've been referred to a liver sprcialist, ultrasound and Gyno and not heard anything at all.

Yes mines the same.. my pain started as contraction like pain on my right side (arou d ovulation).. then it went after 3-4 days then the pain came back but slightly different.. more like intense cramping pain before my period. I didn't link it to my period/cycle at the time. Genuinely thought i had kidney/bladder issues as they kept finding microscopic bloods in my urine but lab results confirmed no uti. Ended up in a&e too (this was a day before my period.. still didnt think it was my period lol) and i thought it was kidney stones, but ct scan was clear. It was only really after 2 months when I started noticing a pattern. Then had painful bowel movement during my previous period too so that's the first time my gp suspected its probably endo.

At the end of the day you just have to decide. It’s never going to get better until you dive in full force. It sucks but it’s true. Good ol’ healthy liver people can get away with it. We can’t. 

My breakfast: 3 hard boiled eggs. Some raspberries. Some blueberries. Some blackberries. Some almonds. Water. 

Lunch: a Salad (just greens and cucumbers and tomatoes)w Chicken. Balsamic dressing. Water 

Dinner: Chicken or fish. No bbq sauce. Brown rice. Vegetables. Virgin olive oil instead of butter. Water. 

Snack: Almonds. Berries. Cucumbers w vinegar. 

Sounds fantastic doesn’t it lol? Well I’m not even having any carbs atm to reduced my insulin resistance so scratch a couple those things off the menu for me. 

Throw in some exercise and you’ll see massive results in 6 weeks. I went from 6’1 205lbs to 176lbs in that time. That was too fast and too much. But it reversed all my numbers. Tough part is reentering the normal food world without falling off the wagon.

(NAFLD = Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) A simple, no-nonsense guide to understand what’s going wrong — and how to fix it with real food, fasting, and daily habits.

⸻

❓ What Is Fatty Liver (NAFLD)?

Fatty liver means there is too much fat stored inside your liver cells. This can slow down your liver’s work, affect your energy, digestion, and even your blood sugar. You may feel fine now — but if left untreated, fatty liver can become dangerous (inflammation, scarring, even liver failure).

⸻

⚠️ Why Does It Happen?

The main cause is insulin resistance.

Here’s what that means in simple terms: 1.	You eat too often — especially carbs and sugary foods. 2.	Your body makes insulin to handle the sugar. 3.	But over time, your body stops listening to insulin. 4.	So your body makes even more insulin. 5.	This causes sugar to turn into fat — and a lot of that fat ends up in the liver. 6.	High insulin also prevents the liver from burning fat.

💡 So it’s not fat that causes fatty liver — it’s too much insulin, caused by too much sugar, too many carbs, and too frequent meals.

⸻

✅ How To Fix It (Naturally and Safely)

⸻

🔁 Step 1: Start Intermittent Fasting

Fasting means taking a break from eating so your body has time to burn stored fat — including the fat in your liver.

Start like this: •	Try 12:12 (eat during 12 hours, fast for 12) •	Move to 16:8 (eat within 8 hours, fast for 16 — for example, eat from 1pm–9pm) •	Once your body is used to it, try 20:4 or even 24-hour fasts sometimes

✅ Fasting lowers insulin, gives your liver rest, and helps it clear out the fat.

🎥 Watch this fun video to learn more: https://youtu.be/3zczNctdKXs?si=SN3UGwmjUC_6rhM6

⸻

🥑 Step 2: Eat a Low-Carb, High-Fat (Keto-style) Diet

The goal is to stop feeding your body sugar and carbs, so it switches to burning fat — and that includes liver fat.

What to eat: •	✅ Meat, fish, chicken, eggs •	✅ Green leafy vegetables •	✅ Butter, ghee, coconut oil, beef or chicken fat •	✅ Herbs and spices

What to avoid: •	❌ Sugar, rice, bread, noodles, cakes •	❌ Processed foods and snacks •	❌ All seed oils (canola, corn, sunflower, soybean) •	❌ Sugary or diet drinks

✅ Stick to 2 meals a day, no snacks. If you’re ready, try OMAD (One Meal A Day).

⸻

💡 What Happens to Your Liver When You Do This?

This lifestyle helps your liver in many ways:

🔹 Fat inside the liver starts to shrink — your body uses it as fuel when you fast and eat low-carb 🔹 Liver enzymes improve — blood tests show lower ALT and AST (a sign your liver is healing) 🔹 Bile flow improves — better digestion and fat breakdown 🔹 Inflammation goes down — liver cells become healthier and less stressed 🔹 Energy goes up — as your liver gets healthier, your body works more efficiently 🔹 Blood sugar and insulin get better — less insulin needed, more stable sugar levels 🔹 The liver begins to regenerate — yes, the liver can heal itself when given the right support!

Your liver is like a hardworking engine — once the fat is cleared and the pressure is off, it can function better, detox better, and help your whole body feel better.

⸻

🌿 Step 3: Support Your Liver with Natural Supplements (Optional)

Some herbs may help support liver repair: •	Milk Thistle – protects liver cells •	Dandelion Root – helps with bile and detox •	Artichoke Leaf – helps with digestion and liver function

📝 Take these from good-quality brands. Ask your doctor first, especially if you’re on medication.

⸻

💧 Step 4: Drink Water and Add Natural Salt •	🥤 Drink at least 2 liters of water daily (mineral water is best) •	🧂 Add a pinch of sea salt — it helps with energy, focus, and prevents cramps on low-carb •	❌ Avoid sugary drinks or “zero calorie” sodas

⸻

🧘‍♂️ Final Tips for Better Liver Health •	😴 Get 6–8 hours of sleep every night •	🚶 Move daily — even a simple walk helps •	😌 Manage stress — breathing, prayer, or relaxing activities •	📆 Be consistent — healing takes time, but it works!

⸻

🎯 Summary:

Fatty Liver = Too Much Insulin Fix Insulin → Liver Fat Goes Down → Liver Works Better

✅ Intermittent Fasting ✅ Low-Carb, High-Fat Diet ✅ Water & Salt ✅ Optional Liver Supplements ✅ Daily movement + sleep

⸻

Your liver is amazing — it can heal and regenerate when you stop overworking it. Just give it the right tools, and let it do its job. You’ll feel more energy, lose weight, and get healthier over time. Be patient and keep going. You’ve got this! 💪

Even losing 5-10% body weight has been shown to have beneficial effects on the liver. The best diet is the one that you can stick with and lose weight. The Mediterranean Diet is a good starting point, has been studied for NAFLD and has many other benefits, and isn’t too extreme, so easier to stick with it. Don’t lose weight too quickly; this can exacerbate fatty liver and can lead to gallstone formation. 

Cut out the “low hanging fruit” first: simple carbs, added sugar, soda, overly processed food, fast food, fried food. Replace with whole grains, lean protein, healthy fats like nuts, vegetables, low glycemic index / low sugar fruit like berries, and fiber. Fiber is very important and overlooked imo (I’m not a doctor). Will help maintain blood sugar levels, lower cholesterol, and will keep you feeling full and satiated. Increase water intake, especially as you add fiber. 

Also recommend starting a walking regimen. Low impact “zone 2” exercise can help burn fat but also has many other health benefits. Taking a walk after a meal helps lower blood sugar spikes. Exercise doesn’t have to be complicated or intense; walking, biking, swimming are all good activities. 

Also recommend strength training. Building muscle is good for our metabolic health. Fatty liver is a metabolic disorder, similar to diabetes. 

People will fatty liver are at risk for diabetes and heart disease, so keep up with regular blood work. 

I can’t speak to your test results, but in general, fatty liver is reversible with diet changes and weight loss. Focus on making changes you can stick with; this is a marathon, not a sprint, so take it slow. You’re making lifestyle change, and it’s hard but worth it. Meditation might be helpful for health anxiety. You got this. 👍",3.0

NAFLD,,1k8g8bl,Is losing weight/portioning enough?,"A lengthy read but I could really use some opinions and help! 

Male, 28, I weighed 300 pounds in December. I didn't start taking dieting and food intake seriously until late February. Early March I had a fibroscan done and showed 400 cap, 11.1 median, and 11.8 KPA. I will add to that my liver enzymes were all high but have all returned to ""normal ranges"" even though a few are still at the cusp of being considered too high. I still have daily pain in my liver area that sometimes eases off and sometimes is pretty rough. I had my gallbladder out in 2021 so it isn't my gallbladder causing pain. Feels dull yet sharp and ""ballooney"".

Fast forward a month after and no calls from the GI at all except when we called and their nurse said ""yeah, you might be right before cirrhosis, maybe not. All depends. Lose weight and come back in six months"". They absolutely refuse to do anything else for me and I'm looking to be referred to another GI but they're going to be 2-3 hours away because where I live there's nobody else to see. I've been absolutely brushed off and in the dark. I asked about Rezdiffra since I'm so far into this from the fibroscan and they said they won't prescribe it whatsoever, just lose weight. I also try to walk half an hour to a full hour a day and during my 12 hour work shifts, I am constantly on my feet walking. I've also heard fibroscans can be wrong in obese person, but I am very tender in the area which worries me that it's right. My GI also told me that gallbladder removal had nothing to do with weight gain and I just ate too much in my life and didn't need to ""sit down and eat a family sized pizza to myself every day"". His words. I was never told to take GI supplements or ox bile after my gallbladder surgery in 2021, just to eat whatever I wanted. I'm worried that is what led me to this. 

From December to April (today) I have lost 30 pounds, down to 270.3 from 300.8. I've been a picky eater all of my life and hate fish and I find grilled chicken very bland. 

My diet now consists of boiled eggs, veggies of all kinds, oranges, grapes, apples, (all fresh fruit, not canned or cups of fruit as they have lots of sugar). bowl of bran/corn flakes or cheerios, and one time a day I'll have a small burger or something else very small that would also be considered ""bad"" like homemade pasta or a slice of pizza and lots of water to tide me over. 

I know this isn't ideal food to eat at all. But I've still dropped 30 pounds by cutting bad stuff out and eating actual portion sizes and measuring stuff like milk and cereal (no sugary cereal, just bran/corn/cheerios)

I've cut ALL sodas out and ALL snack food/chocolates out. I drink water and eat the above 


Does anyone know if by eating portion sizes, eliminating all sodas and junk food, can I still cure NAFLD? Or is my one slide of pizza/burger ruining it? Does anyone else have any experience?

NAFLD,,1jwgb4a,"27M | Elevated LFTs, Fibroscan shows mild fibrosis but no fatty liver—what does it mean?","Hi all, I’m a 27 y/o male, and I’ve been dealing with consistently elevated liver enzymes since my first adult bloodwork in early 2023 (yes, I know that's late). I feel totally healthy and fitter than I’ve ever been (BMI is 21.3, I do HIIT exercise 30 min/day), but my labs and imaging have taken me on a really frustrating journey, and I’m trying to figure out what to make of it now that I finally have some answers from a hepatologist. I’d really appreciate any perspective from folks who’ve been through something similar—or know more than I do about how concerned I should be at this stage.

# My labs (consistently elevated for 2 years):

* **ALT:** Average 88 (most recent: 81)
* **AST:** Average 36 (most recent: 38)
* **ALP:** Average 120 (most recent: 147)
* **GGT:** Average 111 (most recent: 103)
* **Cholesterol:** Borderline at 208 (LDL 122)

My first PCP didn't do anything about this, but my PCP referred me to a gastroenterologist and hepatologist (this took so long to get an appointment, so I saw general GI first). From all those appointments, these have been the results:

* **Ultrasound last year:** Normal liver size and texture; they found a 3–4mm gallbladder polyp which I'm told not to worry about
* **MRI in January:** 3mm gallbladder polyp confirmed and a small 3x4mm hepatic hemangioma, but no real concerns from this
* **Additional bloodwork:**
   * Normal iron, bilirubin, metabolic panel
   * Negative for viral hepatitis, mono, autoimmune markers (ANA, AMA, M2, LKM)
* **Fibroscan recently showed:**
   * Fat score just below the threshold for fatty liver (\~236 dB/m)
   * Hepatologist said there is mild fibrosis, but no cirrhosis
   * He also said there is no clearly identifiable cause of the elevated ALT
* **Thyroid, STI, and additional autoimmune tests** also normal

# My lifestyle for the last 3 years has consistently been:

* **Diet:**
   * I almost never eat breakfast
   * Meal prep healthy lunches (broccoli, rice, chickpeas, sweet potatoes, ground chicken, etc.
   * I eat HelloFresh for dinner 3x/week
   * I go on and off with snacking on processed and sugary foods, this is definitely a weakness of mine
* **Exercise:**
   * 30 mins daily, mostly cardio (Peloton, mountain bike)
   * Occasional strength training
   * Lost 25 lbs post-COVID and have maintained since
* **Alcohol:** Rarely (1–2 drinks/month) but now completely abstinent since Sept 2024 while investigating the liver issues
* **Cannabis:** Longtime daily user. I take breaks every few years. I'm conscious this could play a role in my condition but every doctor has told me it's not a direct cause like alcohol can be.

# My family history:

* **Dad** has fatty liver (NASH), high cholesterol, and multiple sclerosis.
* **Paternal aunt** has primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) and some related issues like granuloma tissue development.
* **Maternal grandmother:** Died of pancreatic cancer in mid-80s.

After having the Fibroscan, the hepatologist has advised I re-test in 6 months and if the ALT remains high and Fibroscan doesn't improve, then to consider a biopsy. I REALLY do not want to get a biopsy if it's not necessary.

NAFLD,,1jqx968,Should I be worried?,"Hi everyone,
I’m not sure if I have NAFLD but I’ve been quite nervous about it for a little over a year and I feel like either my anxiety is getting to me thinking doctors are missing something or maybe the doctors aren’t concerned for a reason.

Anyway, my alt/ast was always in the normal range (usually high teens to low twenty’s) and alt was always lower than ast.

Back in December of 2023, I had a blood test that showed my alt at 90 and ast at 45. Totally random, very odd and never was high before. I went for a few blood tests after that to follow up and the numbers came down within a month or so to ALT 32 and AST 25. 

Ever since then, they’ve been around that same range. Never back to low 20’s or high teens.
My ALT is now always a few points higher than my AST (last blood test was yesterday and my ALT was 31 and AST 27.)

I’m 27 y/o female, in shape, bmi is 21, and I eat incredibly healthy. I do have PCOS and my glucose/LDL are always in normal range but borderline. 

I read online (I know I shouldn’t) that liver cancer can have numbers similar to mine and I’m just freaking out a little thinking doctors are dismissing me.
So asking if you guys think it’s something I should push them to look into more or if it’s just me getting myself all riled up for nothing.
 Would also love to hear if anyone has any knowledge from doctors that they’ve heard or anything like that on the matter. Kind of scared over here.

Test results for reference: 

March (2025) ALT: 31, AST: 27
June (2024) ALT: 25, AST: 24
February (2024) ALT: 32, AST: 28
January (2024) ALT: 34*, AST: 26
December (2023) ALT: 90*, AST: 45
June (2023) ALT: 19, AST: 21

* indicates out of range high (range went up to 32)

Bilirubin is always around .3 and albumin was 4.6 on this last one.

I'm not villanizing fruit, far from it - the balance of components within it actually tells an incredible story that validates what I'm talking about.  Unripe, Fibrous, sour fruit are often fat-burning.  This is nearly opposite to ripe, Fructose heavy, juiced or even dried fruits.  In fact this actually mirrors the ripening process and simultaneously matches the preferences of both animal and plant.

NAFLD,,1j91tom,Managing acid reflux with NAFLD,"Hey so about a month ago my doctor told me I have moderate fatty liver, which was diagnosed through ultrasound. She said my liver was also a little inflamed. 

Prior to this diagnosis I hadn't really been dealing with acid reflux much, but oddly after I cut out fried foods and simple carbs, I've suddenly been having it constantly. 

When I say constantly, I mean that it's there before I eat breakfast all the way until I go to bed. If I bend over or lean forward, it immediately gets worse. 

I've read that antacids can worsen liver disease and so I'm hesitant about using them unless absolutely necessary, but I was wondering if there are options for me that are more liver safe. 

Do these GERD symptoms mean I have more than just fatty liver? Is it a sign of the disease progressing? Is this normal? ",6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/nafld/comments/1j91tom/managing_acid_reflux_with_nafld/,toohighquestions,2025-03-11 14:13:25,1.0,post,,,

What would you consider a ‘good’ macro balance. Or let me simplify that. How many grams of carbs would you stick to on average, or keep as a minimum, whatever? Take any bodyweight for example (if you want) and I’ll do the math.

I know this is a big topic but people rarely talk about it. 

I have multiple digestive issues, also thyroid and some intolerances (eggs/nuts/dairy)so I am struggling atm to make my diet work.

My current diet is worsening my RUQ pain. I blame the saturated fats from 3 meals of (mostly animal source) protein rich foods. Also I think I am too low on carbs. For reference I weigh <210pounds/<95kg. And carb intake is about 80g a day.

Now she is having me do a Fibroscan (liver elastography U/S - different from a regular U/S) to see if/how much scarring, fibrosis there is. Perhaps this was the U/S you had, since your Dr was sure there's just a little bit of fat & it's mostly gone? That's a strong possibility. You shoukd ask your Dr bc that's really significant.

The last couple of years have also been riddled with extreme levels of stress. My sister recently passed away and the first signs of what happened to her was cirrhosis of the liver. 
I felt something was wrong with me mid last year and finally got my doctor to do some blood work. My liver levels and cholesterol were off. 
He informed me that I have the beginning stages of NAFLD and to work on eating healthy and exercising. 
I’ve gotten back into the groove of both. I’m eating multiple greens, healthy fats, lean proteins and hardly any carbs. The carbs i do eat, are more “ancient grain” or sweet potatoes. 

But I’m not losing any weight. I’ve “lost” maybe 1lb and then I’m back up 2lbs. I’m eating significantly less than I was previously and have more exercise in my life. All of my fitness knowledge seems to be going out the window with this diagnosis because nothing seems to be helping me. 
I’ve been told I should try to detox my liver with castor oil packs because my liver may be too angry to process any weight loss? 

Any thoughts/suggestions are appreciated. I’m definitely becoming frustrated and not happy with the amount of effort having a lack of impact.

When doctors diagnose NAFLD or even the diseases associated with it like Diabetes, do they instruct patients to conduct genetic test as a part of the process? Or is genetic connections taken in as a verbal question, like the doctor just asks the patient 'do you have a family history of diabetes' and do clinical tests to find it out and no need of any genetic tests.

It's taken a while to adjust to the lack of salt, but I guess I crave salt less now that I've practically removed lots of foods with added salt from my diet (and from my cooking too). Cutting processed meat and fatty cheese was a big help. Essentially once I removed options like that, I found other options to use instead, like heaps of tinned tuna for example (in springwater, not oil).

I still crave those salty foods sometimes of course, but I guess I've learned to do without.

OP, it's generally good to avoid processed foods as much as possible. I might cave and have the occasional bag of crisps, but overall I don't really have packaged savory snacks anymore. To make it easy, I just avoid that entire aisle in the supermarket. I'm sorry I don't have any recomendations because I just don't eat those foods anymore.

It is hard to make a diet change, but from experience I can reassure you that once you start introducing new foods or cuisines or snacks then over time you'll just crave the other ones less because not only will your habits adjust but your tastebuds will also.

NAFLD,,1ian9su,Weight Gain,"I have had liver issues for about the past 3 1/2 years now stemming from drinking and eating terribly, and its been an up and down time to say the least. Most of my scans and test have come back as normal or slightly above blood markers with a mild fatty liver in scans. Except for last year around this time where I had an ultrasound scan come back as severe fatty liver with advanced fibrosis, however the scan was right after the holidays in which I had binge drunk and ate whatever I felt like, and my doctors said that my high scan was due to  binging as well as having it done at a newish clinic that he felt hadn't mastered their equipment yet. I had a fibrosis scan later in the summer and It came back as 5.3 KPA or some such to confirm at least the damage was not there. I am about to do another round of scans and tests and I'm nervous, the fibroscan wasn't the kind that showed how fatty the liver was so I haven't had a scan to determine the amount of fat I have on my liver in about a year. For those first few months after the ultrasound scan I was incredibly strict however after the fibroscan I have been slacking A bit. At the very start of of all this I was around 6'2"" 270 plus lbs and since then have gotten as low as 168lbs, when I had the fibroscan done In early June I was approx 175-180lb and am now currently at about 205-210lbs,  a good portion of that gain is muscle but I certainly have gained some fat. My diet is still good compared to the average persons (although I'm eating treats like dark chocolate or frozen yogurt sometimes and too many carbs about 150-200gs/day mostly from cheerios, oatmeal, all-bran the rest fruit and veggies) and I lift 5 days a week and do cardio the other two, but I'm still fretting about stuff. Even though I've asked my doctors, (GP and liver specialist) for example taking creatine and protein powder both said it wouldn't hurt, and I showed them both my nail beds which are fairly white and they both said it wasn't my liver even though it looks similar to terrys nails. My liver doc told me as long as I refrain from drinking ( I haven't since last new years) that I wont need to see him again, however my gain in weight (especially over the holidays my resolve was slipping and I was eating more sugary stuff which i usually try not to)  and nail beds being as white or even whiter are making me nervous that I am screwing up.

Let me first assure you, NAFLD is not lethal although we have to take things into account.

First the tissue is the issue. Fibrosis is the key determinant for problems. Fibrosis is strongly linked to problems such as cancer risk and cirrhosis risk and cardiovascular death.

The simple steatosis (NAFLD without scaring and without inflammation, basically fat liver) is quite harmless, although it means something. It means you most probably have metabolic syndrome, a risk factor cluster linked to diabetes and heart disease.

It all circles back to weight and life style. Cure your life style, exercise, eat well and reach normal BMI and the NAFLD is gone.

FYI liver tests are veryyyy bad predictors of health and disease when it comes to nafld.

Hopefully this helps :)",6.0

A few years lost from drinking or NALFD so it looks like no difference comparing without strong statistics, and another vise might give the same little amount of ""lost years"" anyway):
Figure 4 displays life expectancy estimates after a NAFLD diagnosis stratified by sex. On average, life expectancy was 2.8 (95% CI = 0.4–5.6) years lower in patients with NAFLD than the general population: 2.4 (95% CI = 0.4–4.5) years for females and 3.1 (95% CI 0.4–6.6) years for males (Table 3). Patients diagnosed with NAFLD in middle age had, on average, higher life expectancy loss than both younger and older patients. For example, males had 4.9 (95% CI = 1.3–8.4) years and females 3.8 (95% CI = 0.4–7.0) years lower life expectancy compared with the general population when NAFLD was diagnosed between 40 and 60 years of age.

NAFLD,,1ht98qx,Successfully reversed my NAFLD,"I had a repeat Elastography this year and after 18 months of healthy eating, my NAFLD is almost completely reversed.  I am so proud of myself.  It’s not been easy but it wasn’t too hard either because I was supremely motivated.

Previously I had stage 2 Fibrosis, it is now totally normal!  And Hepatic Steatosis, previously Grade 3 (Severe) is now reduced to Mild. 

I (F52) was morbidly obese, I have lost over 100lbs, (still need to loose another 40-50).   No other significant health issues other than the NAFLD.  When I was diagnosed I was determined to save my liver, immediately quit drinking (except rare special occasions like Christmas Dinner etc) and cut out all sugar from my diet (substituting with Allulose where needed).    I also cut all the unhealthy refined carbs and (mostly) only have complex carbs, get a decent amount of lean protein, fruits and veg,  and only healthy fat… I include butter in my definition of healthy fats because butter is good for the soul!  lol

Technically I still have NAFLD because of the steatosis, it needs to come down another 2% and I will be totally cured. Continuing my weight loss and diet will get me the rest of the way there pretty soon. 

Sharing to try to be a ray of hope for some others struggling to adapt to this diagnosis.  If you make the necessary lifestyle changes you can recover and heal your liver.

My GGT and ASP came back as really raised, ASP was 288 and GGT 272. They referred to to blood specialist and for liver ultrasound as well as a follow up appointment with medic team. 
In this time, as us with health anxiety tend to do, I have been googling all possible causes and of cause liver Cis one I keep seeing or other C,s that have then spread to the liver. It reminded me that in January I saw blood in my poo and have had in and off blood in poo all year that o never got looked at (stupid, I know) as I put it down to having a poor diet( fair amount of junk food, fizzy drinks, energy drinks, occasional alcohol) and constipation/straining  which was causing the blood in the poo
Now I’m thinking that I’ve had colon C this whole time and it’s now spread to my liver and I’m stage 4 and I’m going to be given limited time to live, like 3-6 months or something because it’s so advanced. 
I saw the medic team, they retook my bloods, they said some levels had gone down but my liver enzymes were still raised. The drs there suspected I have EBV( Epstein Barr virus) and that’s the cause of the liver enzymes being raised. I mentioned the colon concerns but they said as I’m so young that that would be extremely unlikely.

I understand you are scared, but you need to relax. If you fixate on symptoms, you will cause them. The body and brain are so powerful. Hope this helps.",1.0

They can easily do an EBV blood test to rule that out if thats what they think it is. There are lots of none life threatening things that can cause temporary mild elevation of liver enzymes.  Your liver is also on your right side not the left.

I knew my only chance of reversing this was losing weight. I liked that the database had plenty of things already in it and there were a lot of different ways to measure food in the app. I also liked the weight tracking and how it tells you what your weight loss is equal to at milestones (ex: when I hit 40 pounds down it said that was the weight of a whole car tire). What I didn't like was honesty just how time consuming tracking all my food was. 

My doctors urged me to get on Wegovy or Zepbound and once I did that, I didn't find I really needed to count calories anymore, although it would be good to track my protein. I use the shotsy app to track my injections and happy scale to track my weight. Shotsy links to my apple health, which pulls weight data from happy scale. And with shotsy I can see what my weight loss with each shot. 

What I'd love to see in an app geared toward MASLD/MASH is something that has the positive reinforcement of Lose It when you choose liver healthy foods (like things that belong to the mediterranean diet), a place to track/upload liver scan and lab results, more positive reinforcement/celebration when those numbers/scans trend in a positive direction, links to  credible/peer-reviewed MASLD/MASH information, the ability to track medication and progress on the medication (GLP-1s are being tested for their ability to help MASLD and Rezdiffra is the first medication approved to treat MASH), similar to Shotsy.",1.0

NAFLD,,1gqlj0q,Expecting a NAFLD Diagnosis. Maybe.,"I had some blood work done yesterday. I got the results this morning and noticed my elevated ALT and AST scores. They were also elevated 6 months ago too. 

I did look at other indicators and they are marginal and would require someone who is a bit more versed on the liver than I to do but I've always trusted my gut instinct and intelligence. I'm going to message my PCP when she reviews the results and see if my instinct is right and we should make a next step toward a Hepatologist.

There is some other things that do cast some doubt into this though.

1. I take Acetaminophen 2000mg a day 2x 500mg tablets. This is for my back problems. I never go above the 2000mg in a 24 hour period but I have been taking them over the course of 3+years now so I wonder if its starting to become TOO hepatotoxic. I space the doses out the 1000mg doses every 8 hours when i take my other medications. I stick a pretty rigid schedule.
2. I have a muscle relaxer as part of my meds too that can be hepatotoxic. Though the evidence on pub med and other places that publish papers are kinda of mixed on it.
3. I am Diabetic. My Diabetes is considered controlled. And has been for nearly a decade now.
4. All my Cholesterol numbers are in the normal ranges too.

While I know the perils of using Dr. Google and resources that have paper search. I will always defer to someone who knows more than me. I just want to know the possibilities and other things.

And yes this was posted to r/FattyLiverNAFLD by myself as well. 

I'm not really soliciting any medical advice.. I'll do whenever my Doctor messages me. I am more just trying narrow in my head some thing I wanna focus on.

NAFLD,,1gqiiry,Ultrasound found nothing. ,"I was diagnosed with NAFLD about 15 years ago. My weight has fluctuated since then. I certainly gained weight during lockdowns and due to a new med I've been on for another health condition. As of now, I've been eating healthier and losing weight/exercising more (currently started ~200 lbs and am down to 190 but still working toward around a weight of 140/135 lbs.) well, as I've been losing weight I've been dealing with a lot of nausea, ruq/rlq pain. 


My gp started me on ppis until I have my gi appointment. I also went to the ER at some point for heart attack symptoms but everything was normal and showed no cardiac events, leading me to believe it's somehow related. Well, between the appt and now, my abdominal/gut pain has worsened/become more persistent. I scheduled this imaging appointment and they found nothing.

NAFLD,,1gmp68a,ALT Anxiety ,"Hi, hoping someone can help with my anxiety a bit.. my liver enzymes have always been within normal range. I got a CT scan last year due to something different and looked back and they noted my liver as ""unremarkable""
Fast forward to July 2024, I got my blood work done for my physical and my ALT was 73. My doctor said to retest in 3 months and don't drink alcohol or take Tylenol (I barely drink so that was a non issue). I'm not very smart and didn't even know food had an impact on the liver so l kept eating as normal- not terribly, but not too health conscious either. I retested this week and my ALT came back at 102. How concerned should I be? All other liver panel numbers were normal.

I've seen some news (Reddit posts lol) on Ag1 being awful on the liver. I have been taking that everyday so I stopped today. Also, I had a baby in march 2024. During my pregnancy I gained an insane amount of weight. (Don't judge) but I gained ~ 75 lbs and just now l'm back to my normal pre-baby weight. I have read that significant weight loss can increase alt, could it increase it by this much? For reference, when I delivered I was 205 lbs at 5'5"" and now I'm at ~135. I lost the weight by intermittent fasting.

I scheduled an ultrasound, but can't get in for a couple of weeks so hoping some feedback from this Reddit community can help ease my mind until then.

Thanks so much!!

NAFLD,,1gmp68a,ALT Anxiety ,,,,sarah1096,2024-11-08 12:27:17,,comment,lw50dn5,"Hi! I wouldn’t worry too much at this stage. Pregnancy and weight loss are both huge events for a body. ALT can also be increased by working out or getting sick or medication. 

I’m fairly fit and healthy (37F) and I had an ALT reading of 111 this summer and my new result just came back at 58. I probably do have some NAFLD and I’m going for an ultrasound too, but my ultra runner and super slim sister also had NAFLD and so do many others. It’s quite common. My current approach is to increase foods containing soluble fibre and decrease saturated fats since my cholesterol was too high also. 

There’s some evidence that a caloric deficit could also trigger NAFLD as it is found in people with histories of eating disorders or who have experienced famine. This isn’t talked about as much in North America since so many people have NAFLD because of caloric excess. 

So my suggestion is to wait for the ultrasound and while you do just take extra good care of yourself. Eat something like a Mediterranean diet full of lots of healthy fats, carbs, and fibre and try to get good sleep (I know - hard with a baby!), try to minimize stress and prioritize how you feel, and enjoy gentle exercise.

So, what happens when you need to take an antibiotic or antifungal?. Are there ones that are safer for those of us with NAFLD?. Has anyone here ever taken an antibiotic or antifungal since being diagnosed with NAFLD and what was the name of it and did you have any complications from taking it?.

NAFLD,,1fhawe2,Just found out that I have severe fatty liver disease 😥,"So, I went to the ER yesterday for breathing issues and burning in my stomach. They did scans, labs, an EKG and gave me a steroid and PPI via IV as well as a GI cocktail.

The Doctor gave me a clean bill of health other than fatty liver disease. I already knew that I had this but figured it was mild but when I got all of my results paperwork home, it said in two different places that I had severe fatty liver disease and gastritis with gastric bleeding. It then went on to recommend a liver ultrasound and some other type of test. Also, the patient hand-out talked about cirrhosis, jaundice and liver failure so I was pretty freaked out to say the least.

I have put on 30 pounds over the past six months even though I eat like a bird and the ER Doctor even asked if my belly was always puffed out like that.

Later, I read that abdominal swelling and gastric bleeding can be caused by fatty liver disease and now, I'm wondering if the gastritis, gastric bleeding and burning sensation might be caused by the fatty liver disease as well. Sometimes it feels like there is heat in my abdomen that radiates out to my entire body. I do not drink alcohol at all and am not diabetic or obese so I'm wondering if it's in some way connected to my stage 4 NHL/MZL cancer and all of the many, many treatments and procedures I had before I went into remission.

NAFLD,,1fh3gmn,Wondering if anyone has had a similar journey or could offer any insight ,"Hi! 36 yo M diagnosed with NAFLD roughly 10 years ago based on elevated LFTs, ultrasound showing fatty infiltration and clinical morbid obesity. I didn’t really take many steps to improve until about 2.5 years ago when I began losing weight. I had a FibroSure blood panel done 3 years ago when I was about 310 lbs (I’m 5’9”) and the results showed moderate to severe steatosis, probable NASH and no fibrosis. I also had a shear wave ultrasound elastography at the same time and the result was an average stiffness of 4.7kpa (F0-F1). Since that time I began losing weight and am currently down 80lbs and about 100lbs since my highest weight. My regular bloodwork the past few years have shown my AST and ALT decrease into normal range and my cholesterol decrease significantly. 

Now for the perplexing part. I had a repeat FibroSure panel and shear wave elastography done in June of this year (obviously after losing the weight) and the results of the blood panel showed No NASH, No Fibrosis and minimal to no steatosis. However the elastography showed an average stiffness of 10.9kpa which translates on their scale to F3-F4 fibrosis. This got me a referral to a hepatologist. I’ve just had a full round of blood work done, this time without the FibroSure but instead an ELF blood test and a FibroScan, as opposed to the shear wave elastography. I am still awaiting the results of the FibroScan but the blood tests showed my AST, ALT and other liver function parameters still in normal range and the ELF score was 8.7. One thing to note about the blood work however is my AST/ALT ratio has increased pretty significantly in the last few years. Through the past decade of blood work it has remained pretty constant at around 0.5 but starting about 2 years ago rose to .7, then to .8 this year and the most current blood work it was 0.9. My platelets have also been on a steady decline in the last 2 years as well, always hovering between 340-400, and then steadily dipping to 320 and now 305. (I know the platelet levels are not “low” but they are now the lowest I’ve ever had in a decade of annual to biannual blood tests and have seemed to concurrently drop along with the rise in AST/ALT ratio.) 

Finally to the questions/insight; Has anyone seen this type of trend after losing a significant amount of weight? (worth noting I did it naturally with diet and exercise and averaged around 3lbs a week at first then stabilized out around 1-2lbs a week). I’m not very familiar with the ELF test and read a few contradictory things about cutoff values and how to classify that score, if anyone has insight about that? Also, I’ve seen contradictory things about AST/ALT ratio and whether it is concerning if the numbers are in range. Has anyone had a noticeable and steady increase in their ratio? Or a steady drop in platelets either concurrently or isolated? 

I realize this is a long winded post, so thank you to anyone that reads it and can offer any insight.

I have a plan to meet with a dietician to help me curate some meal plans that benefit my liver condition, and continue exercising as regularly as I can. There was a point in time 2 years ago where I was eating terribly and gained a considerable amount of weight, and my assumption is that damage to my liver has just been continuing.

The beautiful thing  about our liver is that it regenerates itself. It’s the only organ in the body that can do this.
And the other amazing thing is that this is completely reversible. I reversed my NAFLD 6 years ago. I just had full metabolic panel done and liver scan and everything came back normal and my liver is it healthy. 
This diagnosis is probably one of the best you could get because this gives you the opportunity to redirect your health and live into a healthy future armed with nutritional and health knowledge that you gain along the way and be able to make better food choices and why you are making them rather than just making these food choices because someone on Instagram or TikTok said it was healthy. 
I would also advise to focus on what you can eat rather than what your gonna miss out on when you get over that mental hurdle your food choices will come a whole lot easier
You will get a lot of conflicting dietary advice, I would stick to foods that you enjoy eating with a flavour profile that you are used to without introducing anything really radical to begin with so if you’re not accustomed to eating tofu or if you don’t like eating mushrooms don’t eat them. 
This gives the opportunity to learn what are and to choose nutrient dense foods. 
Make small changes gradually. For example, in the first four weeks of beginning my ketogenic journey I gave up one carbohydrate group a week and learn to cook and eat without it before eliminating the next group and  built my confidence and my knowledge in how to cook cook and eat and entirely different New way that made me feel amazing and achieve a healthy life. In that time I avoided going out and eating out until I really understood the ins and outs and that probably took about a month to 6 weeks but once you know how it’s really easy. 
I’d like to add a caveat the ketogenic lifestyle i follow is not is not high fat that mainstream media would have you believe. 
It’s based on eating fresh whole foods prioritising protein and using fat as a lever to manage your hunger rather than using processed carbohydrates as a filler. The carbohydrates you do eat are from fresh non starchy vegetables primarily green ones. 
NAFLD is almost 10 years in the making before it gets diagnosed and its generally a result of overeating  proceeded and refined carbohydrates over a long period of time. Don’t blame yourself though. 
If you need any help I’m happy to provide more tips.",3.0

Are you seeing Hepatology for your liver?  If not get a referral as they are liver specialists not GI and not primary care.

The itching can be one area or all over the body. Remember your nails carry bacteria.  Avoid scratching.  Use a cool wet washcloth instead. Don't take hot showers.  I found taking them earlier helped a lot.  A late shower almost triggered it.
 
Itching is mostly due to an excess of bile salts in your body. As fatty liver disease progresses, it can lead to a build-up of toxins in the blood and cause itching. Liver damage in NAFLD can also release inflammatory substances, which may also contribute to itching. 
 
Itching can become worse in the evening or at night.

Talk to you doctor, specifically your GI doctor and see if they recommend a biopsy. I had one, and it verified I do not have cirrhosis which was great news. Further it confirmed the keto diet induced weight loss was working as the liver fat readings were less then they expected to find. I got an Apple Watch and started exercising everyday, closing those rings and increasing goals over time.

I am a decently heavy drinker I guess. A bottle of wine most nights of the week, so that's why I had assumed it was because of the alcohol. I also got diagnosed with Graves disease, which I learned can elevate liver enzymes before treatment. 

I know there's a ratio situation that can show if liver damage is due to alcohol or not, and it usually shows AST being double or more than ALT, but as we can see, my ALT is is a little more than double the AST, which makes me think it's NAFLD?

The best thing for your liver is Keto and Fasting. Cut all processed trash food. 

Also- to all others who may stumble upon and curious. This Product is a Scam and definitely not Zero Sugar in my opinion. It claims Zero Sugar yet Concentrated Orange is one main ingredients? And it is further sweetened with Erythrotol and monk fruit. ok. But the first real red flag is there is no Nutrional Label on the website-shame on me. And even though Concentrated OJ is high on the list there is not even a line on the label for sugar or carbs. WTF. Even if there is a small amount of OJ there will be sugar and carbs. Just no. No, no no. They should be ashamed. it's not even organic. If its not organic its not a health supplement. I would share an image of the label but no images allowed in this thread. 

I have been fasting and in ketosis for weeks and I test for ketones and had high levels before taking my first dose in the evening. 14 hours later after evening sleeping waking up. Ketons are way down. What!? Second dose this AM and an hour later I am on my way out of Ketosis. 

If you want a healthy liver you have to cut sugar and carbs and all the artificial toxic bullshhh that is pumped into it and sold out there. 

I do believe and have good experience with the main ingredients but I do not think they are as concentrated as claimed. All of these herbs are super bitter, spicy or strong. None of those profiles are present. If so they are faint and overpowered by citric acid and Erythrotol. I thought this could be convenient way to consume these ingredients but your much better making your own mix and instead or OJ use lemons WAY more potent. If you need some sweet just use some honey and salt. Delicious. 

  
Dose is yet another great marketing camping selling you processed sugar with shit preservatives.

Citric Acid is a derivative of Black mold. Yuk. Again eat lemons y'all.

NAFLD,,1e09kfv,Should I get my liver checked?,"Hey everyone!

I am concerned that I might have a sluggish liver, and I want to be prepared with all the facts to my doctor.

I have a lot of little things that are “wrong” with me and it’s been difficult getting a straight answer. I was recently diagnosed with vestibular migraines that I have not gone to a specialist for as of yet, but taking an anti histamine daily and eating low histamine diet really helps. I’m not sure if it will take care of them entirely, but I feel better and have less spells.

On top of that, the majority of my symptoms could be related to each other or perhaps not. They are vague, but here is why I feel I might have a sluggish liver:

- my mom has NAFLD
- my stool is often a greenish-yellow color, it’s rarely a dark brown
- my bilirubin levels have been consistently right at 1.2 which is just into the realm of high, for the past two years in a row
- I have had unexplained right rhomboid pain for years; I’ve had an MRI and have done PT and chiropractic work. Nothing helps long term. I read this could be differed pain.
- my vestibular migraines are often mainly dizziness and they don’t know the root cause 
- I sometimes get a throbbing pain in my middle right back as well, just below the ribs.
- I’ve been diagnosed with insomnia and have never slept an entire night through. The problem is more often with sleep being interrupted throughout the night, but I d have a history of not falling sleep at all.
- excessive thirst even when adequately hydrated 
- I feel certain parts of my body as constantly itchy
- general fatigue but I have severe ADHD and I’ve always figured that’s what causes my energy swings.

I think that’s it. Do you think this is sufficient to ask my doctor to take a look? To give you more context, I only drink maybe 2-4 drinks a week and eat VERY well. I also exercise on a daily basis. By all accounts I should be above average in health!

Much like the guide channel, it had the listing of the shows on TV for the week, and some sort of synopsis of what the episode was about.  Much like what we see in streaming service today.  Sometimes it was a sentence or two.  If the show would do a big “very special” episode/season premiere, there could be a whole article with interviews.  
In its initial run, M*A*S*H (I believe - some one will correct me if I’m wrong) ran after 8 o’clock.  That time slot was for “serious TV” cause the children would be in bed.  So they could do more adult comedy and such.  Dinner time (like 5-6) was for the family friendly/light hearted shows (like Happy Days).

MASH,,1ofz24w,"Thoughts about Goodbye, Farewell and Amen","I just finished re-watching all of MASH on Hulu.  (They have (IMO) a very impressive wide-screen conversion of the show.)

Throughout my re-watch, I was surprised by the number of episodes I do NOT recall seeing before - back in the day, I watched so many MASH re-runs on our local UHF station, I was sure I must have seen them all.  The final episode hit me just as hard as when it originally aired, particularly the last 10 minutes or so as everyone is saying their last goodbyes.   I also liked this symmetry: every episode begins (i.e. the opening titles) with choppers coming in for a landing; and the very LAST shot of the whole series is of a chopper flying away, taking Hawkeye home.  

What follows below is not meant as criticism, just an oddity I noticed.   (Just in case anyone’s reading who hasn’t seen the finale - spoilers ahead.).  

The ep starts at a mental clinic where we find Hawkeye an involuntary patient.  (A brief digression: the FIRST time I watched the finale those initial scenes briefly made me think we had jumped forward in time, and that we were seeing a ***post-war*** **Hawkeye** committed to a **state-side** mental hospital.  I thought perhaps Pierce had some kind of mental breakdown **after** being sent home - from PTSD maybe.  That COULD have worked - we could have seen the final days of the 4077th in a series of flashbacks as Hawkeye described them to Sidney - but I was kind of relieved when that wasn’t it.  Anyway...)

In a small room, Sidney prompts Hawkeye: “Yesterday you were going to tell me about that day at the beach.”   A little reluctantly, Hawkeye describes the beach outing, and in flashbacks we see Mulcahey, Hunnicut, Klinger, Soon Lee, nurse Kellye and others enjoying themselves.  

Next, Sidney asks Hawkeye about the ride back to camp, bringing us the first ""party-bus"" version of the ride home.  (We also see that Margaret is among the partygoers, though I don’t recall seeing her in the beach sequence).

**This is important**:  *everything that REALLY happened on that bus was witnessed by* ***a couple of dozen people***, including most of the show’s core characters.

At the clinic, Sidney and Hawkeye are interrupted when a phone call comes in for Hawkeye.  Potter, Hunnicut, Mulcahey, Klinger and Houlihan, all take the phone and awkwardly wish him well.  Hawkeye irritably demands they get him released, and while his colleagues are sympathetic , they are obviously not planning to get him an immediate release.  They seem baffled and worried by Hawkeye’s predicament, yet hopeful that Sidney can help him.  **It’s the “baffled” part that struck me as odd**.   Moving on…

Sidney eventually helps Hawkeye remember the terrible truth about that night;  that the bus picked up some Korean refugees, plus a group of American GIs, including some injured - and that the they had to hide the whole bus from an enemy patrol, staying silent to avoid detection.   To his horror, Hawkeye remembers the awful moment he’d suppressed:  a Korean woman on the bus had suffocated her own baby after Hawkeye hissed at her to keep him quiet, lest they all be discovered.  

Sidney brought Hawkeye to this moment in his usual, breadcrumb-following way: he pays close attention to Hawkeye’s word-choices, what things he seems purposefully vague about, and what mundane questions provoke his anger.  

My point here is:  Sidney ***could*** have been far more direct **if he’d known in advance** what was probably bothering Hawkeye.  It seems clear to me that **Sidney DID NOT know about what happened on the bus UNTIL he finally got it out of Hawkeye.**   

And that, I think, is the odd thing:   **WHY?**

Try to imagine Potter calling Sidney and saying “Sidney, I think Pierce needs your help.  He’s acting very strangely - yes, more than usual…”.   Yet **NOT** adding:  “He hasn’t been the same since a trip to the beach a couple of weeks ago.  You see, there was a really terrible incident on the ride home….”  and filling in the details.  

I really feel like **somebody** \- if not Potter, one of the others - would TELL Sidney about the bus incident when they first reached out to him regarding Hawkeye’s erratic behavior.  It’s exactly the kind of shocking, sickening moment that would haunt ANYONE for a long time -  particularly in the days and weeks right after it happened.  

Indeed, it’s arguably a *little* strange that, for the entire rest of the episode, nobody else even mentions the bus incident.  Granted, it’s not the kind of thing they would want to reminisce about, but considering Hawkeye’s difficulties it’s hard to believe none would ever suspect a connection.   Heck, if I were Sidney, whenever (and however) I heard about the bus incident, I would be concerned about the possibility that the OTHERS on that bus might also be struggling to come to terms with it.

Again though, **my fondness for MASH and the finale in particular are in no way diminished by these observations**, I’ll give it a complete pass.   Still it’s something that occurred to me on a second viewing (separated from my first viewing by 40 years…)",35.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/mash/comments/1ofz24w/thoughts_about_goodbye_farewell_and_amen/,Beady_El,2025-10-25 11:35:58,33.0,post,,,

They've all seen death, live with it, eat waiting for it, sleep dreading it. For Pierce, he feels directly responsible. For Margaret? It was awful. Pierce doesn't break down over the dog she was secretly feeding, for example. For Potter? It was a Korean doing what she needed to survive; he's seen enough desperation in times of war to know it's a terrible business and his out is like BJ's; his wife.

I watch MASH as the story of Hawkeye gradually losing his mind; he fights against it, tries to retain his humanity, but the final is the culmination point for him. He feels like he's killed. Not the war, not the woman, that baby's life was his and he ended it to save everyone else.",17.0

I think that may be why they wouldn't have others discuss it on-screen - anything that was said would tend to focus attention on Hawkeye's behavior, and they didn't want that.

The producers of MASH knew of Bill Christopher, and thought he'd be good to replace George Morgan Not that the producers disliked George. They just wanted more 'natural accentricity', as Larry Gelbart said it, later. But when they called Bill in, he totally ab-libbed his audition. It's known that Gelbart hated improv over what was scripted, and actors always stuck to the written words on MASH. 

So Bill went home, and somebody (Burt Metcalfe, maybe) got hold of Bill's agent and said, uhh, your client pretty much blew it. But tell him if he comes back and Sticks To The Script, we'll have him back. Bill came back and re-auditioned, and the rest is history!",9.0

MASH,,1oeclpv,Should BJ have told his wife?,"I think Hawkeye did the right thing, throwing that letter in the stove. Honesty is important in a marriage, but there's also tact. You don't say everything out loud, just because it's honest, when it's only going to cause problems. Adultery can lead to divorce, and BJ is a good person; he doesn't deserve to have that happen to him. And more than that, his wife doesn't deserve what he's going to put her through. However much anguish he's feeling over the adultery is nothing compared to what she will go through, as she agonizes over the decision to leave him or not. And things will never be the same between them. It can't even be called an affair, as that implies an extended on-going sexual liaison. Of course, some people here seem to think he's feeling guilty over just a kiss on the lips.

MASH,,1oeclpv,Should BJ have told his wife?,,,,OldTell311,2025-10-23 13:07:37,,comment,nl0mdig,"Yes I remember thinking Hawkeye was being a good friend there. BJ clearly loved Peg madly and he was torturing himself for betraying her. So much so he wasn’t thinking clearly. He wanted to absolve his conscience by coming clean but he wasn’t thinking how that would mean Peg would now have to bear the burden of his failure as well. 

BJ wasn’t Henry Blake or Trapper or Frank who happily carried on affairs with no real remorse or desire to repent. Hawkeye knew BJ wouldn’t become a serial philanderer and would never want to feel that guilt again. We see this later when Maggie O’Shea presents BJ with a very tempting offer of a love affair and this time his loyalty to Peg and his family reasserts itself. He learned his lesson and stayed true to his resolve to never do it again. 

The later seasons show the consequences of the infidelity that was treated lightheartedly early on. We see BJ’s guilt and torment, and we see the perspective of the nurse whom he spent the night with and how she was impacted too. In the end Hawkeye was not telling BJ that his slip was OK, but that he’s still a good man, husband and father and not to also punish Peg and Erin for a one-time mistake that he clearly regrets.",24.0

Hawkeye is very intelligent, dedicated and skilled.  Also very caring, cares about the “little people” (the low ranking soldiers) and hates authority.   Acts very un-military.   Very “holier than thou”; kind of always on a moral high horse.  But like others have said, his character is very complex so hard to tell what your dad meant.

Edit:  If you want to watch one episode that maybe explains him best, try “The General’s Practitioner”.  A general wants Hawkeye to be his personal surgeon and Hawkeye wants nothing to do with it despite the fact that it would mean better accommodations, food, working conditions, and fewer hours for him.   Col. potter tells the general’s aide “if the general were being carried in on a stretcher then Pierce would be the guy you’d want but as a personal physician?  No way!!”  That describes Hawkeye perfectly.",3.0
MASH,,1ocz7yj,"What does it mean if I ""act like Hawkeye""",,,,nakedonmygoat,2025-10-22 05:45:06,,comment,nkrpivc,"Without knowing you or your father, it's hard to say what he means. Hawkeye is good enough at his job that he rarely feels a need to listen to authority. It's kind of a ""I'm so good you can't fire me, but I sure as hell wish you would!"" mindset.

He's deeply caring to the point of sometimes being sanctimonious. He chases women and martinis like it was his job and is always ready with a joke for whatever occasion. But if you've got a real problem, whether medical or just something weighing on your mind, he stops the jokes and moralizing and will help in whatever way he can.

As for his treatment of Ginger I think he treated everyone of a lower rank like that.

Meanwhile, he was simply awful to all the enlisted personnel and chewed several of them out for minimal things.

Frank Burns wasn’t intentionally racist, just out of touch/ignorant.

In the Season 5 2 parter “Bugout”, Col. Potter asks Cpl. Klinger to give up his wardrobe for the war effort, trade his bras for a building and give his clothes to a Mamasan and her crew. Why didn’t Klinger give up his dresses for an address in the US and tell Potter he wanted a discharge first? Klinger’s not above scheming and he’d never have as much leverage as he did then.

When Potter arrived, he ordered Klinger to dress properly. One conversation with Hawkeye and Potter changes his mind. My guess is Hawkeye told Potter that Klinger is good for morale. He also does his job properly and effectively and cares for the unit. They like him for what he represents. 

Potter understands this and realizes that if Klinger is good for unit morale and cohesion, then he can let this go for the good of the unit. He soon learns to respect Klinger and even rely on him for being able to get things done. 

Klinger understands this as well. And as others have said, he would never hurt the unit or endanger the wounded. They didn’t ask to be there, they are kindred spirits. And he respects Potter and sees how Potter leads and cares for the unit. No way would he betray that man. Klinger wouldn’t dare - he has his values. 

So while he wants out, no way is he getting out at the expense of the wounded. He’s getting out the way a real man would - by wearing dresses, being deemed a psycho, and given a Section 8. ",12.0

Giving up some dresses that were ultimately just a personal hobby, to help the unit, was not enough. And Klinger was enough of a man to realize that and make a sacrifice for the greater good. Potter gave him ample praise for that, which he richly deserved.",7.0

MASH,,1oaw2ik,BJ and Trapper,"I’m doing a re-watch and I’m about halfway through season 5. The transition from Trapper to BJ has been interesting to me. 

It’s obvious that many, if not most, of season 4’s scripts were already written before Wayne Rogers decided to leave, and that they did very minimal re-writing and just had BJ say Trapper’s lines. 

In Potter’s first (full) episode, the colonel is meeting his officers, and reads from a file that says Pierce and Hunnicut held a weenie roast in the latrine. Without missing a beat, BJ responds, “We’re not allowed to cook in our tent!” I can almost hear that line in Rogers’s voice. 

He’d been there for *one week.* As bad an influence as Hawkeye obviously was, it’s hard to buy that BJ was this much of a smartass to his new CO that soon. All throughout his first season, a lot of BJ’s lines sound like things Trapper would have said. It’s almost like they just didn’t know what to do with the new guy, even into season 5. 

IMO, It wasn’t until around “Dear Sigmund” (5.7) that BJ really started to get a personality of his own. I’m looking forward to watching it develop even more as I go on.

MASH,,1oaw2ik,BJ and Trapper,,,,drjones013,2025-10-19 15:56:46,,comment,nke1rar,"A lot of fans notice the tonal change at Season Five. Alda really starts stepping in as a writer and director as the original writers begin to burn out; I didn't realize how serious that kind of burnout could be until I started comparing it to modern shows. These guys did over twenty episodes in a year! The shooting schedule had to be absolutely grueling and last minute changes to scripts (hey, I think it'd be funnier if you did it this way) were probably serious problems as the cast was getting snippier at the scripts (Stevenson and Rogers both felt that Hawkeye was dominating the cast).

So the scripts obviously for Trapper had to stay. It wasn't realistic to rewrite an entire season for the new actors (I shudder to think what would have happened if Stevenson hadn't given notice and Morgan was required to work with Henry scripts) and Hunnicutt's character, much like Winchester's, was built ironically as both comparison and departure from their predecessors.

There are really two problems with Hunnicutt's character. Radar was already covering innocence in war, Klinger was already covering the human reaction to being drafted, and Hawkeye at this point becomes angrier and angrier at being trapped in the war. Where should he fit in? The second problem, very much related to the issues Rogers had when thinking about leaving, is that Hawkeye was the focal point of the show: how does a new character develop without central air time? So BJ stepping away from Trapper is a subtle thing, it's there even in Season Four, but in short bursts because the show is firmly moving in the ""Hawkeye is going crazy and everyone else is trying to deal with it themselves.""

That being said, I'm Team BJ. He gets enough stories where he isn't Radar, ends up mirroring Klinger, and doesn't compete with Hawkeye, a very thin eye to thread.",53.0

As with Frank, the writers seemed inexplicably boxed in on who the Hawkeye sidekick was supposed to be, at least until the replacement showed up. Trapper never really stood a (boxer’s) fighting chance. Yet the second BJ steps into the Jeep, he’s a fully fleshed out character. Where was this kind of character development during the first three years?  It’s not like Wayne Rogers didn’t call out for it desperately.

In comparison, BJ offered a lot of contrast to Hawkeye, with a fresh faced bemusement at the chaotic futility he suddenly found himself placed in. Unfortunately, by the time the party hat shows up, all that detached innocence had withered into insufferable sanctimony with bad puns (and bird imitations).",51.0

First appearance of Nurse Kellye? She appears in the scene where the Chinese patient is threatening the OR with a scalpel. Not named and no lines, masked but her eyes are unmistakeable.

First appearance of Sidney Freedman (although not called Sidney) who turns up to evaluate Klinger.

I realized a while back Boone only showed up then and in Germ Warfare, which to me really shifted the tone as Dish, Jones and Boone all made their final appearances before being phased out and the Original Six being the main focus at the end of the episode. Then Dear Dad aired and that was, of course, a major turning point in the first season. 

It's funny that Germ Warfare was actually the fourth episode filmed, yet when it aired made sense (unlike a lot of early season 1 episodes).

MASH,,1o9n456,Trapper Boxing,,,,22_Yossarian_22,2025-10-18 05:54:24,,comment,nk4tu3c,"I completely agree.

It was such an odd choice that as the show went on longer, they shrunk the universe so much.  The early years there were more nurses with more lines, General Hammond, Bradley, Clayton, and Mitchell were important parts of the show.  For the Season 2 debut, General Clayton reintroduced the main cast.

I have always been curious why Clayton disappeared.  Could be he had a deal for another show that never got off the ground.  But, he fit the show well.  After Season 2 generals basically completely disappeared.

Also through the first three seasons there were other doctors in the background besides the main 4, which was a bit more believable.

But in the late season the universe is the show was reduced to the main cast, Kelleye (who was no Ginger), and the occasionally
Sidney appearance.",3.0
MASH,,1o9n456,Trapper Boxing,,,,misterlakatos,2025-10-18 09:36:27,,comment,nk5wzrq,"Well said and agreed - the generals were pivotal to the comedy and the greater dynamics of the show and its premise. Clayton obviously was the most well-known/had the most appearances and it's a shame he did not continue. Herb Voland had great chemistry with the cast and was very believable. Hammond and Barker were great, though neither seemed meant to be on the show beyond a few episodes. Mitchell was less memorable, though still played an important part. 

I also do not like the fact that the universe shrunk so much and having an abundance of nurses with more lines in the early to mid seasons really helped the show a lot. The show almost feels claustrophobic and tired in the last few seasons since so many episodes were dark and filmed indoors. When watching anything through season 6, there are far more outdoor shots and the show seems brighter.",2.0

In the final scene of the pilot, G. Wood was announced as a character (along with main cast and other recurring characters such as Odessa Cleveland, Timothy Brown, and George Morgan).

Wood had sort of an odd career, he did sporadic TV work, and at the age of 50, MASH was his film debut.  He had a couple of large roles in big movies, but all in all was in a total of 5 films.

First martinis and Old Fashioneds are both spirit forward drinks. They contain the same amount of alcohol. A martini is shaken or stirred over ice to chill it.

Second. Frank wasn’t ever ordering or drinking an OF. Margaret was. They laughed at Frank because he was drinking a Shirley temple.

My understanding is the following:

Ideally use Fibroscan if clinically indicated; however, given Fibroscan’s well-documented inaccuracies with significant overestimation of fibrosis in patients with higher BMI’s, blood tests like Fibrotest/Fibrosure and ELF are clinically indicated over Fibroscan for those with obesity.",2.0

With the other health benefits from it, my fairly simple plan is to stay on it at a reasonably low dose, until new things come along.

One easy way to justify the cost is the savings in food. Not only do I just eat the cost of oz less, but I also tend to not buy the more expensive junky things.

More fruit, oatmeal, basic meats, etc. 

Way fewer restaurants.

Congratulations on taking this big first step!
Remember that this whole process is a marathon and not a sprint. 

I'll offer some advice to help you on your journey that I've given countless people in my time in this group and my time on ozempic/wegovy. 

First of all, don't expect miracle results overnight. Not everyone has the same timeline of results. Some people see results ""overnight"" with .25, some people don't see results until 1.0 or higher. 

Next, the recommended dosing guidelines for ozempic are a minimum of 4 weeks at each dose of .25, .5, 1.0, and 2.0 according to the official ozempic website and information. I *strongly* recommend you only increase by .25 at a time (.25, .5, .75, 1.0, 1.25, etc), you can find click charts online for your specific pen size to customize the dose (for example, each increment of .25 on a 1.0 dosing pen is 18 clicks). Stay on each dose a *MINIMUM* of 4 weeks. If the dose is still giving you good results after 4 weeks, stay on the dose. Filling those two guidelines will maximize the overall effectiveness of ozempic over time as well as minimize any potential for side effects. Only increase to the next dose when the current one loses effectiveness.

You need to follow the titration schedule or you risk more serious side effects, that's why the schedule exists in the first place. 

Also when doing your injection (usually belly, but some people do thigh), make sure your pinching the skin a good amount of the 'fatty' tissue and injecting into that area, and holding the needle there after your injection finishes clicking down for an extra count of at least 5 seconds (to make sure all of the medication was dispensed)

Thirdly: figure out your BMR and TDEE, you can Google a calculator to do that online and it will give you that right amount of calories to safely consume in order to lose weight while still getting adequate nutrition and the calories needed to survive. 

Also, you need to track your food and keep count of the calories of what you eat to stay in that range. I recommend finding a good app that you like. Personally, my favorite is loseit, but there are many great options out there. Tracking your food and staying in the calorie deficit is a key to success.

Try to prioritize protein and fiber as much as you can within your meals. There are a lot of great and creative ways to add them into your diet. When you don't feel like eating a protein shake is a great way to get some calories and protein in. There are always powders, and for premades, I find fairlife and Premier protein to be the best. As far as powders, i find the best thing is to get the trial size ones and figure out what ones you like and don't like, better than buying a whole bag. 

*Drink. Lots. Of. Water.* I can't emphasize this enough. You need to drink as much as you reasonably can. Ozempic will dehydrate you,  and water is essential for weight loss. Excretion is how the fat leaves your body. 

Remember that adding things like crystal lite, mio, lemon, or whatever else you need to in order to make your water easier to drink doesn't make it count any less as water. It all counts. Also, buying a water bottle you absolutely love helps. Tricks your brain into wanting it more.

Do your body measurements now. There will be times it feels like the scale isn't moving at all, but the measuring tape will, and you will be grateful that you did. 

Also, take ""Before"" pictures! It's something I didn't do but I wish that I had. You might hate the look of them now, but you'll be so happy to have something to compare to later.

The number one side effect people have is constipation, diarrhea is less common. Increasing your fiber intake helps with this significantly. (Personally, I really enjoy all bran with some milk and honey in the morning), but if it gets out of hand, remedies like restorlax, etc, will help. If you do end up with diarrhea, something like imodium should help, (but for me some of my other meditations can cause diarrhea, and they've been canceling each offer out lately). Another big side effect is nausea, ginger chews, tea, and supplements help, peppermint tea,  having protein and fiber before bed to give your stomach something to ""chew"" on for the night,  gravol (dramamine),  if it gets really bad some doctors will prescribe hefty anti nausea meds like zofran.

Another common side effect is hair loss.  It happens because of decreased nutritional intake as well as rapid weight loss.  Increasing your protein intake as well as some supplemental help can help nip that in the bud. What worked for me was increasing my protein and adding in biotin supplements and (*yes, it sounds crazy*) prenatal vitamins. It works.  My hair is almost back to normal, and I'm still losing. 

I probably missed something. If I did, I'll add it with an edit line. Feel free to ask if you have any questions! I've been on ozempic/wegovy for 2 years. I'll drop my stats underneath! Welcome! And congratulations again!

Ozempic,,1ohx0e5,How are y’all staying committed?,,,,TheNyxks,2025-10-27 20:06:24,,comment,nlrkeen,"Been living with PCOS since I was diagnosed with it in 1985, and in truth I never worried about my weight until High school when my front started to become to heavy and I needed a reduction, only to be told that I needed to louse 100lbs before it would be safe for them to do the reduction. I wasn't over weight at the time (BMI wise I was, but in actual fat % no where close I was at 25% body fat and was an active mostly healthy Paralympian. Yet still the doctors in charge or such surgery refused based on BMI being to high (going private wasn't a option for various other medical reasons). 

Fast-forwards to 2003 when I was diagnosed with insulin resistance and my endocrinologist said that I needed to go onto insulin sensitivity medications to help make my body sensitive to insulin. Over the next 3 years I'd put on a solid 50lbs as I tried different insulin sensitivity medications and my insulin needs increased as did my a1c since I wasn't able to get my glucose under 10 (180) despite being very active, eating as I should things where working against me. 

In 2005, I was put on Byretta and within the month my glucose levels started to come down, end of the year my a1c was starting to come back down and the 50 that I'd gained 3 years before had started to lesson, by 2010 I was back to pre-Insulin Resistance weight and a little less to boot. Then it stopped helping and a1c started to go back up, as did the insulin - weight didn't shift in either direction. Was switched over to Victoza and nothing, no lowering of glucose levels, no lowering of a1c and no reduction in insulin needs regardless of the dosage, weight remained steady. Then in 2016 was moved to Trulicity and instead of things staying the same or getting better my insulin needs increased till I was needing 500U of U200 Humalog and 350u of u200 Tresiba, no improvement in a1c, it also continued to increase. No change in weight eight, was still the same as I had been in 2010. 

Then in 2018 I was switched over to Oz and at first it was no change, but when I started 0.5 that's when things started to shift in the right direction. A1c started to lower, active insulin dropped down to 100u a day and then evened out at 50u a day, but background insulin needs remained unchanged. for 6 years I stated at 0.5 because it got my a1c down to 5.5 and due to the continued shortages that kept me from getting a reliable and steady supply for way to long - I did louse ground when I was forced off one to many times, but always regained once I had a stable dosage long enough. 

Fat loss did happen, but I put on more muscle so it offset what the scale was showing, I went from 40% body fat down to 30% and when I moved up to 1mg last year I finally hit the 25% mark (though for a short time was at 22% - but that wasn't sustainable for medical reasons) and have stayed around there. Background insulin needs after 6 months went down to 200u of u200 Tresiba but there is no chance of it going lower as I can't increase from 1mg due to it being to dangerous due to my already low a1c. So I'm currently stuck at 1mg until another GLP-1 is approved that works as well or better then Oz (though I fear with the introduction of generics it will actually work worse and I'll see things climb once again and all the progress that was made since 2018 will be undone - due to my bad track record with generics/biosimilars'). 

So in short for me there has been nothing to get discourage about, a1c is in non-diabetic range and holding steady which was the goal of being on a glp-1 in the first place, any other positive side effects are a bonus in my books, including any fat reduction that's happened.",1.0

Focusing on whether something is ""natural"" is a choice. But it suggests interest in root causes. Calorie dense foods is just one factor, though thinking about the environment is on the right track.


Poor nutrition education and the societal disconnection from agriculture and understanding the food supply. Sedentary environments, tvs, computers, suburbs, cars, and desk jobs. Awareness of public health guidelines and the economic and location accessibility of produce. 


Recent weight loss approvals for GLP-1 medications can feel like a solution. But they don't solve much; I think they're only the next step. Treatments rather than a cure. They are expensive, have some side effect risks, and aren't fully accessible.",8.0

I see a lot of people on this thread who talk about obesity as if it's purely driven by genetics. Sure, it can contribute, but it's not like our genetics have changed that much in the last 100 years, yet the average person has ballooned in size since then. I've seen it speculated that it could be our genetics being altered by industrial chemicals, but I think the more accurate culprit is exactly what you're getting at- the rise in hyper palatable, fiber lacking, cheap, nutritionally devoid foods. 

I firmly believe that most people who are currently overweight would be a healthy BMI if they only consumed foods that existed 100+ years ago. It's pretty hard to eat in a surplus using this framework unless you lean heavily into dense sources like oils, butter, nuts, oats, pasta, etc...

The biggest help to me is to stop thinking of food as a way to only get rid of hunger. You have to think of it as nutrition. I make better food choices knowing something is giving me nutrients that my body needs vs empty calories. I prioritize protein and whole pure foods. If I have to eat something that came in a box or can, I look for the ones with the fewest ingredients and preservatives. They don't add sugars to food because you need carbs, they add it because their food tastes like crap without it.

When I would grocery shop in the past, I would have a cart full of breads, boxed and canned stuff. I would look at what others were buying, and just like my fat ass, all the overweight people had the same stuff piled high. The people who were fit looking had a small cart with fresh fruits, vegetables and unprocessed meats. I used to kind of chuckle and think they don't really enjoy food because who would eat that stuff? What joy is there in a salad? I'll stick with my cheap box of Mac and Cheese and case of Mountain Dew. My body and health has paid the price for that. Now I make nutrient dense meals and the flavors are incredible. Everything I put in my mouth, I consider the nutritional value of it. Btw, I love a good salad now. 

I am T2 but now off Metformin and my A1c is 5.1. Someday I will probably be off Ozempic but breaking old habits and learning a healthier way to eat is undoubtedly going to be the key to success. I know what got me to the overweight T2 me. I don't want to go back to that.",3.0

Before we know it, anyone still NOT using GLP drugs will be affected by this arms race, as foods are being custom tailored to turn off satiety signals for even those using GLPs.

Although the package says there are 4x 0.25 mg doses, in reality there is a total of 2 mg of the drug. So 8x 0.25 mg or 4x 0.25 + 2x0.50 mg. For some reason, EU pens are like that.

Ozempic,,1ohwj4i,Ozempic Week 3,,,,Mysterious_Squash351,2025-10-28 03:00:32,,comment,nlsw883,"The half life of the medication is a week, so when you shot 2, you still half half of shot 2, when you take shot 3, you have half of shot 2 and 1/4 of shot 1. It builds over 4-5 dose before reaching steady state. So what changed from week 2-3 is you have more drug in your system.

Sulphur burps are caused by food sitting and literally releasing sulphur. You’ll have to experiment a bit and see what foods don’t work for you. A lot of people get issues with things like cruciferous vegetables, legumes, some people struggle with raw vegetables. Also, lots of people go all out on “healthy” supplements - for example protein shakes and bars  - when they start the medication, and those types of foods often contain multiple ingredients that can cause digestive issues. Keep an eye out for things like carrageenan, sugar alcohol sweeteners, and artificial sweeteners. Any one of those could be the culprit, as could the protein source itself (people are quick to blame lactose when it comes to dairy, but there are other potential issues - I can have whey but not casein, for example, so I can’t get any protein drinks that have casein in the ingredients or aren’t 100% hydrolyzed whey).

I personally found digesting enzymes were a quick cure to sulphur burps. Stopped them within the same day. Now sometimes I take them preemptively if I’m going to eat something that could be challenging (like Brussel sprouts and steak), or I’ll take them at the first sign of indigestion if something just feels like it isn’t sitting right. All in all I use them probably once a month or so, and haven’t had sulphur burps since I started.",2.0

Ozempic,,1ohvudz,What to expect month 2?,,,,TheNyxks,2025-10-27 19:40:54,,comment,nlrg467,"There is no predictable answer as it will vary from person to person in how their body is responding to the GLP-1 peptides, some people the starting dosage does 100% nothing and its like injecting water (nothing happens, positive or negative regardless of how long they are on that dosage). For other's the 0.25 is the only level that they ever need to reach a healthy A1C and if needing to louse weight start that process (others need a higher dosage to see weight change, but the higher dosage might bring glucose issues such as hypoglycaemia - so that also has to be factored into the mix, and yes a non-diabetic can still experience hypoglycemia episodes when taking a GLP-1. 

Which means for some people staying on 0.25 for years isn't uncommon before they see the need to increase to 0.5, just like there are those who see/feel nothing on 0.25 yet at  0.5 that's where for them things start to happen (positive and maybe negative). And again staying at 0.5 isn't uncommon for extended periods of time until it is deemed a higher dosage is needed for whatever medical person. 

I personally spent 6 years at 0.5 because at the dosage it was working as designed, a1c went into non-diabetic range and stayed there, active insulin lowered and over all things where very stable. For myself I only increased to 1mg because my background insulin wasn't going down, so I wanted to see if the higher dosage would lower my background insulin needs (it did, but it took 6 months before it started to happen, which was most annoying as the first reducing in active insulin happened within hours of my first injection of 0.5 - but that was far from the case with 1mg). 

1mg lowered by a1c even further, which means my endocrinologist will not increase any higher because the risk of hypoglycemia is just to great of a chance, so the background reduction I was hoping for is a dream it will not be lower then it is now because i'm maxed out at the dosage that is safe for me to take as things currently stand.",3.0

Ozempic is just labeled for diabetes, and wegovy for weight loss. 

Secondly, for weight loss medications in Canada, it's generally blanket approvals. You're approved for semiglutide AND liraglutide (wegovy and saxenda), for example. 

I am through desjardins, and my husband is through bluecross/medavie. We have both been approved through both insurance companies, but you need to file preauthorization paperwork that you and your doctor fill out for all insurance companies, and they have to approve it. I know with bluecross the initial approval lasted 6 months, then it had to be resubmitted, and it was permanently approved after that. With desjardins, it's yearly.

Ozempic,,1ohrzwh,My doctor suggested switching from Ozempic to Wegovy to possibly get it covered by insurance for weight loss. What are your experiences?,,,,TheNyxks,2025-10-27 15:45:03,,comment,nlqa4b8,"All Canadian Insurance companies cover all GLP-1s and GLP-1/GIPs ... it is your specific plan that you have through your employer or have gotten yourself that will say what is and isn't covered. 

You can often get a run down of what is covered though HR, or by pulling up the plan you have and doing a search for a specific medication if the insurances formulary. However, most basic plans that companies tend to have for their staff doesn't cover GLP-1s unless you are diabetic, a few might if they have something like a health and wellness plan (I know the banks have such a extended plan that can be op-ed into), but sadly due to the cost many plans that do cover wagovy only cover up to a certain amount each year - often its around 5k worth of medication, which is only a couple months worth of pens and then you reach the max that is covered. 

So you also have to look into that aspect of things, if it is covered, because many people have be over joyed to find it covered only to learn that once they have been on it for 9 months (or less) that when they go to refill the script that they are paying full price as they reached the max for the year of it being covered, or in some cases life time coverage. 

If you know that you will likely need to pay out of pocket, wait. In 2026 three generic semaglutide biosimilars are going to be coming to market (once Health Canada approves them - the day the patent runs out the three makers are going to submit their deals and from there 3 to 6 months down the line we should start seeing them approved to market) as the patent that Nova has runs on in January 2026. It is being reported that the generic will cost upwards of 60 to 70% less then what the set price that the government has set for it to be sold at. So in some cases that could well be 40.00 to 50.00 per pen on average (in most cases under 100.00 is the consensus). Which means more plans might well open up to cover them since the cost will be less of a hit to their bottom line (but it also makes it more affordable for those who don't have coverage or who's plans just will not cover regardless.",4.0

Ozempic,,1ohcerd,Having a positive experience so far and just want to share good vibes on this thread!!,"I did my first shot at .25 last week on Thursday. Traditionally for me, my overeating happens mainly on the weekends when I don't have the structure of the work day. On top of that, I had an 8 hour road trip planned for this past weekend. Another occasion where I would normally snack the whole damn drive and use it as an excuse to eat fast food. In addition to everything mentioned above, I am a coffee addict, love some weed, love a good glass of wine or cocktail, and nicotine. Current nicotine vessel is vaping (i know, none of these habits are great). HOWEVER. 

I was absolutely shocked at the immediate positive impact this has had on me. I had one coffee for the entire 4 hour one way drive (this would easily be a 2-3 coffee situation for me prior). Packed a protein shake, an apple, and some cheese sticks for the drive. More than enough to keep me satisfied. Barely used my vape, which I would normally be hauling on for a long solo drive. And normally would be croaking for a J on this drive, but I was not. 

Got to my hotel at my destination. Ordered a glass of wine. Took over an hour to drink it. Ordered some steak bites for an app. Stuffed half way through. Its like a whole new world.

Only side effect is a mild headache but I always dealt with mild headaches prior to this (probably from excessive coffee drinking LOL). 

All that to say, I feel motivated to quit all of my vices and actually feel like I can.. am I ... about to become an entirely new person?

For example, if you are 200lbs then 10% of that is 180 (which is under 2lbs a month loss - which isn't much by most peoples thinking). If you are 250lbs then 10% of that is 225lbs. It's slow, but it also varies based on level of insulin resistance, age, activity levels, and how your body actually responds to the GLP-1 medication, over all. 

Remember if your calories intake it too low, your body may burn muscle before fat. That's why dietitian's recommend no more than a 500-calorie deficit from your maintenance level, and not dropping below 1500 calories/day to avoid nutrient deficiencies. 

To know your numbers if is best to see a registered diabetic dietitian and work with them to figure out the right amount for your specific needs/lifestyle, etc. However, a general TDEE can give you a generic starting point, but your needs will shift every 20lbs that is lost. 

Ultimately weight loss isn't about the scale, it is about preserving muscle, improving glucose control and building sustainable long term habits. GLP-1s can support the process, but they are not magic. Their role is to help regulate how your body uses insulin, the rest is about how you fuel and move your body.",3.0

Ozempic,,1ogz8qj,"2 Years on Ozempic — Strict, Disciplined, and Still Stuck at the Same Weight. Scared to Stop Because the Food Noise Comes Back.","Hey everyone,

I’ve been on Ozempic for almost 2 years, now on Wegovy 2.4 mg, and I’m honestly at a loss. I’ve been trying to lose weight for 3 years straight and despite doing everything right, the scale hasn’t really moved.

I also take Metformin 500 mg, blood pressure meds, cholesterol meds, and Vyvanse 10 mg.

About 3 weeks ago I started doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and have stuck to it almost perfectly (just one 16:8 day). Before OMAD, I wasn’t a big eater either — I usually skipped breakfast and only ate lunch and dinner. I don’t drink any calorie beverages either, other than alcohol once a week.

Here’s what I’ve been doing consistently: High-protein, low-carb meals Calorie intake under 1,800/day Lifting 2–3x a week Walking/golf daily 2–3L of water + electrolytes 7+ hours of sleep with CPAP (sleep apnea managed)

Despite all that — I started at 273 lbs, dropped to 267 lbs the first week of OMAD, and now I’m right back at 273 lbs again. It’s like my body just refuses to let go of weight no matter how much I dial in my diet or exercise.

The most frustrating part? I actually feel healthier — my resting heart rate is down, energy is better, and I don’t feel sluggish anymore. But seeing zero movement on the scale after years of trying is disheartening.

And honestly, I’m terrified to stop Ozempic. The food noise — that constant mental chatter around food — was brutal before I started. It’s the one thing Ozempic completely silenced, and I’m scared it would all come back if I stopped.

Has anyone else hit this kind of long-term plateau where everything looks perfect on paper but your body just won’t budge? What finally worked for you — if anything? Did anyone switch medications or tweak something that finally moved the needle?

⸻

TL;DR: 2 years on Ozempic/Wegovy + Metformin, clean diet, fasting, workouts, no calorie drinks, and still the same weight. Feel better but can’t lose a pound.

I had to really get focus on my nutrition.  I started tracking my macros (fat, carbs, protein) and found that while I was eating less, I wasn't eating enough-- really only about 1000 calories daily because I had no appetite.   And with that, even though I ensured I ate some good proteins, I was nowhere close to my daily goal of 130g.  Once I started planning my meal and tracking those numbers, I've dropped over 10 lbs.  My daily goals of 130g protein/ 169 carbs/43g fat, totaling just about 1600 calories a day. I started at 255 and am currently around  244.  From March to October, I  pretty much lost and gained the same 2-3 lbs.  I was consistently working out the entire time as well.

Given that Ozempic can cause muscle loss, I believe it's imperative to be diligent  and aware of how many calories you consume and how much protein.  I'm in a weight loss clinic and my assigned nutritionist just talks about mindful eating, eating 3x a day and eating protein, but hasn't IMO proved the tools or accountability needed for any weight loss. I previously was in a nutrition program and learned how to track macros and so I reverted back to that.  

You have an active lifestyle and that's great! I agree that you should do some measurements because you likely have lost inches and built muscle.  I think that some of us have put in more work with our nutrition and fitness to have the weight loss others experience easily taking these meds. Good luck!",1.0

But particularly for you, read through my dosing guidelines. But there might be other things that help you as well 😊


This is a general comment for first-time users/starters or people looking for advice 😊, I hope it helps!

Congratulations on taking this big first step!
Remember that this whole process is a marathon and not a sprint. 

I'll offer some advice to help you on your journey that I've given countless people in my time in this group and my time on ozempic/wegovy. 

First of all, don't expect miracle results overnight. Not everyone has the same timeline of results. Some people see results ""overnight"" with .25, some people don't see results until 1.0 or higher. 

Next, the recommended dosing guidelines for ozempic are a minimum of 4 weeks at each dose of .25, .5, 1.0, and 2.0 according to the official ozempic website and information. I *strongly* recommend you only increase by .25 at a time (.25, .5, .75, 1.0, 1.25, etc), you can find click charts online for your specific pen size to customize the dose (for example, each increment of .25 on a 1.0 dosing pen is 18 clicks). Stay on each dose a *MINIMUM* of 4 weeks. If the dose is still giving you good results after 4 weeks, stay on the dose. Filling those two guidelines will maximize the overall effectiveness of ozempic over time as well as minimize any potential for side effects. Only increase to the next dose when the current one loses effectiveness.

You need to follow the titration schedule or you risk more serious side effects, that's why the schedule exists in the first place. 

Also when doing your injection (usually belly, but some people do thigh), make sure your pinching the skin a good amount of the 'fatty' tissue and injecting into that area, and holding the needle there after your injection finishes clicking down for an extra count of at least 5 seconds (to make sure all of the medication was dispensed)

Thirdly: figure out your BMR and TDEE, you can Google a calculator to do that online and it will give you that right amount of calories to safely consume in order to lose weight while still getting adequate nutrition and the calories needed to survive. 

Also, you need to track your food and keep count of the calories of what you eat to stay in that range. I recommend finding a good app that you like. Personally, my favorite is loseit, but there are many great options out there. Tracking your food and staying in the calorie deficit is a key to success.

Try to prioritize protein and fiber as much as you can within your meals. There are a lot of great and creative ways to add them into your diet. When you don't feel like eating a protein shake is a great way to get some calories and protein in. There are always powders, and for premades, I find fairlife and Premier protein to be the best. As far as powders, i find the best thing is to get the trial size ones and figure out what ones you like and don't like, better than buying a whole bag. 

*Drink. Lots. Of. Water.* I can't emphasize this enough. You need to drink as much as you reasonably can. Ozempic will dehydrate you,  and water is essential for weight loss. Excretion is how the fat leaves your body. 

Remember that adding things like crystal lite, mio, lemon, or whatever else you need to in order to make your water easier to drink doesn't make it count any less as water. It all counts. Also, buying a water bottle you absolutely love helps. Tricks your brain into wanting it more.

Do your body measurements now. There will be times it feels like the scale isn't moving at all, but the measuring tape will, and you will be grateful that you did. 

Also, take ""Before"" pictures! It's something I didn't do but I wish that I had. You might hate the look of them now, but you'll be so happy to have something to compare to later.

The number one side effect people have is constipation, diarrhea is less common. Increasing your fiber intake helps with this significantly. (Personally, I really enjoy all bran with some milk and honey in the morning), but if it gets out of hand, remedies like restorlax, etc, will help. If you do end up with diarrhea, something like imodium should help, (but for me some of my other meditations can cause diarrhea, and they've been canceling each offer out lately). Another big side effect is nausea, ginger chews, tea, and supplements help, peppermint tea,  having protein and fiber before bed to give your stomach something to ""chew"" on for the night,  gravol (dramamine),  if it gets really bad some doctors will prescribe hefty anti nausea meds like zofran.

Another common side effect is hair loss.  It happens because of decreased nutritional intake as well as rapid weight loss.  Increasing your protein intake as well as some supplemental help can help nip that in the bud. What worked for me was increasing my protein and adding in biotin supplements and (*yes, it sounds crazy*) prenatal vitamins. It works.  My hair is almost back to normal, and I'm still losing. 

I probably missed something. If I did, I'll add it with an edit line. Feel free to ask if you have any questions! I've been on ozempic/wegovy for 2 years. I'll drop my stats underneath! Welcome! And congratulations again!

Ozempic,,1oh7khd,Dosing Question,"So I've done my 4 weeks on .25 and am finishing my 2nd week on .5 but my next pen is was prescribed for 1.0 dose. Is it okay to start on 1 after only 2 weeks on .5? I have noticed that .5 seemed at least for me to be less effective at keeping the food noise/cravings down. If I would be better off doing 2 more weeks on .5 does anyone know how many clicks it would be?

Ozempic,,1oh2ldn,Hypoglycemia & neuroglycopenia while on OZ?,"So, i’ve been on and off of Ozempic for like over a year

This last time I was off of it for two or three weeks because of insurance issues

I just took my dose Tuesday, 0.25

I started having these strong reactions whenever my blood sugar would start to fall

The reaction was to the blood sugar falling, not the number itself

For example, I would go from 130 all the way down to 80 in the span of one hour

And I’m not gorging myself with empty sugar calories or high carbs or anything like that. 

I’ve kept a very strict food diary since restarting Ozempic.

The only time I have any “strong sugar” is when I have to treat a rapid fall that accompanies a bunch of really scary symptoms. 

Has anyone out there had anything like this after being on Ozempic?

I sent my doctor a message because today was just hell for me. 


The fast rate falling symptoms, especially the ones that are neuroglycopenia in nature : non painful pressure/congestion feeling in head that only goes away as blood sugar gets stabilized. 

Is honestly making me scared to drive, shower, get up and walk around, live a normal life.

I put in a phone call to my doctor and also sent a very urgent message through the messaging portal and I will be calling first thing tomorrow to follow up for an immediate appointment

But have any of you ever experienced “reactive hypoglycemia” while on Ozempic? 

Thank you 😊

Ozempic,,1ogl924,Costco Pricing in Canada,,,,Allimack,2025-10-26 12:09:09,,comment,nliw39r,"The red box pens include 2 mg of Semaglutide in 3mL of solution. The initial prescription is usually for 2 red boxes. The red box pens allow the 0.25 and 0.50 dosage. The starting dosage is usually 4 weeks x 0.25 and then two weeks of 0.5. So the first red box pen lasts for 6 weeks. The second red box pen allows for 2 more weeks at 0.5 and then 1 week at 1.0. Or 4 weeks at 0.5mg.

At that point you would be moved over to the blue box pen. The blue box pen contains 4mg of Semaglutide and the only setting on the pen is the 1.0 dose.

When I started Ozempic in February (in Ontario) the red box was about $240 and when I moved up to the blue box (which contains twice as much medicine) the cost went up by about $10, currently it is $252.

The blue box is a much better deal per mg, but the lower dosages aren't marked on it, and the blue box pen only comes with 4 needles (the red box comes with 6). 

I think the $482 price you are looking at is the cost of 2 red box pens. Each one on its own is ~$241. You potentially save on one of the $4.99 dispensing fees by having both dispensed at once. If you can't afford to pick up both red boxes at once, then just tell them you want one. It's better not to buy both, anyway, since you don't yet know how well you will tolerate it.

Edited to add: I was really happy getting my prescription from Costco. At the first prescription pick up the pharmacist walked me through the initial testing of each pen (where you place a needle on it and turn it just to the first notch and test that the pen works; you only do this once, at the first dose of each new pen). I had watched a video in advance, but it was helpful to have it explained in person. The pharmacist also gave me a free ""sharps"" container for the needles. And during the summer months they always offered a cold pack with my prescription (which I never needed as I always had my own cooler bag with ice packs in the car).",3.0

Ozempic,,1og69kx,New food sensitivity after a year? Sweet Tea is now an enemy 🤢,"​Hey everyone,
​I've been on Ozempic for about a year now and it's been mostly great! good weight loss, side effects have been minimal and predictable, mostly just mild nausea/fullness when I overdo it.
​But recently, I've had a couple of really rough, and honestly, kind of bizarre reactions to food that I never had before on the medication.
​The biggest culprit, and the reason for this post, is sweet tea.
​I've had it occasionally over the last year without issue. However, I've now had two separate situations in the last week where I had sweet tea and within an hour or so, I started lurching/gagging/near-vomiting. It's that awful feeling where you can tell your stomach is just NOT having it. After I puked I was fine both times. 
​Has anyone else this far out (a year+ in) developed a new, intense sensitivity to a specific food or drink that you were fine with previously?
​It's weird that I'm only having this extreme reaction now. Is it possible that the delayed gastric emptying has slowly made certain foods intolerable over time, even if I was okay with them initially?
​Just wondering if I'm alone in this or if my body is just officially filing an injunction against sweet tea.


​TL;DR: Been on Ozempic for a year, just recently started having vomiting reactions to sweet tea, even though I was fine with it before. Did anyone else develop a weird, new food sensitivity this far into their journey?",5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1og69kx/new_food_sensitivity_after_a_year_sweet_tea_is/,Flat-Sprinkles-2367,2025-10-25 16:49:44,11.0,post,,,

Ozempic,,1ofnfam,31 lbs lost after 4 weeks,,,,belasombra,2025-10-25 02:58:10,,comment,nlaa73k,"Good morning, my recommendation is that you eat a little more. Try to eat enough protein so you don't lose muscle, and that also helps keep your hair from weakening. But above all, slower weight loss helps the skin to do its job and not hang. Imagine that you continue at that pace and in two months you lose 30 kg. All the skin would be left hanging. 
I recommend losing between 1.5 and 2kg a week to help your skin and not lose muscle.
It's just a piece of advice, we all want to see the numbers on the scale go down, but it has to be done wisely and so that it lasts.

Also I don't think you should stay on 0.25 longer because you don't have any bad side effects and smaller doses stop wroking pretty fast. 

Faster weight loss usually goes for 4-8 weeks for most people, so don't worry about speed fr now as long as you feel fine. Starting from 3rd month, you should aim to lose no more than 1% of your body weight per week. At 170kg it would be 1.7 kg per week.

I don't know if you're mail of female but. I Kilo of fat is 7700 Kcal

A female BMR is 2000 and 2200 for male. So 14.000 kcal per week if female and 15.400 for male Now at 185 it will be higher. 

You will need a deficit of 7700 to lose a kilo of fat. If you lose 14 kilo of fat that means a deficit of 107.800

Math won't math. What you lost is mostly water and muscle..... Not 14 kilo of fat.

It will bite you in the ass later when your BMR will be significant lower due to muscle loss. Not to mention you may get a ton of other health problems. Loose skin will be the least.

My best advice: if it's working, like all of your metrics are improving and your weight is going down, don't let your MD push you to up dose. If it's working at a low dose, stay there until/if it stops working or your progress slows. Then go up. Going up when everything is going in the right direction is just an invitation for side effects that are not tolerable. When ozempic is being used for diabetes treatment I feel like docs are more likely to want you to keep going up dose when you don't need to vs when it's prescribed for weight loss. When it's for weight loss I feel like the provider is more likely to titrate dose per your current response. Just my observation.",5.0

Going down in dose or stopping/restarting will not likely be effective.

However, you will likely start losing again if you go to a slightly higher dose such as 1.4mg (using pen clicks).  The lowest cost option may be to get a Rx for 2.4mg Wegovy and do a 1.4mg dose.  The 2.4 pen contains 9.6mg of solution so it will last almost 2 months.",-2.0

Count the clicks to the 1 mg mark. I think it will be 37 clicks. That would make .50 mg =18 clicks

Over the summer, after many months of no issues, I’ve started to get really bad injection site reactions- super red and itchy. I use compounded because of insurance coverage and cost issues, but I changed pharmacies after the reactions started and have had the same issues. I get the same reaction no matter where I inject; inner thigh (preferred) or stomach. I alternate legs every week and the reaction follows. I’ve just been using the insulin needles that come with the meds, so the brand and type seem to vary. I’ve had a few weeks where I think I’ve found a certain type that works, but then I can never repeat the success. Also, I do TRT (yeah, my body has basically given up on regulating anything about itself), and I don’t have any issues with those needles. 

I went to the dermatologist and he said that “you can develop a sensitivity to anything at any time for any reason”, which I gather is basically dermatologist-speak for “I don’t know.”

A GLP-1 injection site reaction is a random reaction your body can start to have at any time. The body will also randomly decide to stop having them. I had them dose 6 to 20 or so and then they started up again around dose 60 for a couple weeks. 🤷🏽

As long as the ISR remains localized, most prescribers are not worried about them.

Also. Stop injecting your inner thigh. It’s not a recommended site, as there are too many venous structures there. Plus I can’t imagine willingly getting an itchy spot there weekly.",2.0

I try to warm it up on the counter a little which helped some, and also to let any alcohol fully dry first. And to wait to pull out the needle, 15 seconds or so and try to avoid wiggling it and letting it get into the puncture at the level of the skin. I tried antihistamines which helped a little, but I can't tolerate them longer term due to random other issue. I changed to really higher dose tirzepatide which was much more concentrated, and injected way less volume, and that helped a lot. I only inject a tiny amount now though the dose is the same.

I tried to stick with what i was doing while on OZ (increased protein, water, smaller portions, etc - all of it), and have been having about as much success as i had before needing to go on OZ to begin with.   The scale is now laughing in my face.   My starting weight was 265 - i lost 55 pounds in about 2 1/2 years time, and it only took 2 months to gain nearly half of it back.  WTF.    

I'm staring at the one 8mg pen i have left in the fridge and I'm wondering if I should just go ahead & click dose to .25  and ride it out hoping to calm things down again and to get me through the holidays,  or if it's even worth it since I can't afford to pay out of pocket to continue?  I'm hearing a lot about microdosing and wondering what those dosages are and how that works.  I'm looking into the online med-spas and whatnot that are doctor-supervised, but I have to give up all kinds of information in order to get ""qualified"" so i haven't done that yet (and i don't want to get scammed and spammed).

Ozempic,,1oegb8t,1 pen left....not sure what to do.,,,,cleverfox2001,2025-10-23 16:59:24,,comment,nl1sr2j,"Sorry for your situation.

I would start back up with a 0.5 dose.  Most prior users find that their bodies are used to Ozempic and can handle a higher starting dose.  That may be enough to stop the weight regain.  However, you would need a much higher dose to start losing again.

As I understand you have limited funds, I would continue the 0.5 dose.  If that is not enough, try a 0.75 dose.  Using pen clicks, 73 clicks is a 2mg dose, 36 clicks is 1.0, 27 is 0.75, and 18 for 0.5.  So, the pen should last you about 3 months.  Yes, that is longer than the standard 56 days but most unofficial sources indicate that will not be a problem.  You will also need extra needles.  However, they are inexpensive at Amazon, any online diabetes supply company, or your local pharmacy.

If you can save up $500 over the next 3 months, have your doctor write a Rx for 15mg Mounjaro or Zepbound.  These products are available from Lilly direct and are usually more effective than Ozempic/Wegovy.  You would start at a 2.5 dose by clicking or using a syringe.  If you want to start losing again, 5mg or 7.5mg should be enough.  So, the 15mg should last 2 to 3 months.  Many doctors will do this if you explain your insurance situation.

I pay out of pocket and was purchasing Ozempic/Wegovy from one of several Canadian online pharmacies.  Their prices are about half of those in US.  I switched to Mounjaro as the top doses of Ozempic/Wegovy were no longer effective.  Lilly Direct is fast and lower cost than my Canadian sources.  And, I am losing again.",4.0

Which is why they (insurance) set certain criteria to qualify for certain meds, or ask that other meds be tried first and fail, before going to the high priced options. Or, needing 3 to 4 denials before considering allowing a high priced med to be used.

The doctor can recommend a medication, but without prior approval it's not happening. And many insurance companies, exclude certain meds, no matter what it's main use is for, if even one of its off label uses can be used for weight loss. And some will force you to wait until your BMI is back to where it was, before paying for it again.

So if you can't pay out of pocket, and the drug maker does not offer any sort of discount, and you are not eligible for RX discounts private or state. You are sadly stuck until something changes. So ask ask ask, for all possible medication discounts that are out there that your doctor/clinic knows about.",1.0

Ozempic is made by Novo Nordisk in Denmark. *They* have the prices set so ridiculously high that insurance companies are very strict with prescriptions. To be eligible for qualifying plans, health insurance companies in the USA are limited to only 20% administrative overhead, which leaves little room for profit or for covering losses.

Ozempic,,1oeqcr2,Ozempic vs Mounjaro,"Im sure there are plenty of subs regarding this exact comparison. But for context, I have been using ozempic for about 2 years. My highest weight before using was 288lbs, and my lowest within a year on Ozempic was 243lbs. 

Like many others, I developed gallstones and had an operation to remove my gallbladder approximately 9 months into the weight loss. A few months after the surgery I went on a long awaiting Europe trip and decided to take a break from injecting for about 4 weeks. I ended up gaining around 12lbs but was determined to get back and lose the extra pounds. After this trip, I had multiple visits to the ER due to some excruciating pain around my belly button but doctors never seemed to find anything after checking all my vitals and doing regular scans. Until after the 5th visit i insisted for a CT scan. In the scan it showed that the pain was due to an umbilical hernia. So another operation was scheduled to fix that. I went through 2 operations in one year. These pains and operations made me skip injecting quite a lot, and I eventually started gaining weight again.

Fast forward to today, I have gained a little over 30lbs and Im sitting at around 277lbs. Its been incredibly hard to get back to the lowest weight I was when I first started. Im still using ozempic weekly (1mg) but for some reason its not having the same effect. Im not over eating, im not back to my regular bad habits of eating junk, but im also not necessarily watching what I eat to be fair. I go for my regular daily walks, and am quite active with my 5 year old niece. At the beginning of this journey the nausea was extreme which is what made me lose weight, but I dont feel nauseous now and actually get hungry even the day after my injection!

I’ve heard many great things about Mounjaro, and I have an appointment with my doctor this week to discuss our options. 

My question from Redditors is: 
Should I even bother trying Mounjaro or is my body just rejecting these GLP’s considering ozempic is no longer working for me? Has anyone tried ozempic and had no great results but was successful with Mounjaro? Im really considering Bariatric surgery at this point if nothing else works.

I’m 38 years old. Started Ozempic at 35. I’m 5”10. I started at 104kg, and with Ozempic (max of 1.5mg I think?) I got down to 93kg. Floating around 93-95kg. I stayed on Ozempic for 2 years, paid a ton of money but it just wouldn’t budge down 93kg.

I eventually decided to switch to mounjaro. Didn’t switch diet / exercise patterns at the time. Immediately dropped down to 92kg and kept losing weight. That helped my motivation and I’m now dieting and exercising even more (paying money for Ozempic, somewhat dieting etc and not losing more weight was demotivating for me).

Now I’m down to 83kg with a goal of 77kg (maybe a bit lower depending on how lean I can get).

Since I had it approved by insurance, and it was the only good GLP1 in my formulary, I stuck with it for 6 months. I never got past 0.75 mg. I lost about 30 lbs in those months, and had some other good results (reductions in migraines and other inflammation). I was resigned to pain and acid issues, mitigated somewhat by tips from this sub. My weight loss stalled in the last several weeks I was on it. 

I noticed Mounjaro in my formulary before my next endocrinologist appointment, and asked to switch. It has 100% been the right move for me. The side effects are *so* much better. 

I started on 5 mg and gained weight the first 3 weeks (this is very common during the switch). Moved up to 7.5mg, and have been pretty steadily losing an average of 1.2 pounds a week since. I just hit a year on these drugs. I’m now down over 66 pounds and on 10mg of Mounjaro. (30 on Oz for 6 months, 36 on MJ for 6 months)

I lost 18 lbs the first month while on .25mg, which seems to be atypical, especially at my size, but I'm sure a large chunk of that was water weight. 

I was put on steroids for 2 weeks after the 1st month on ozempic and was told that I would likely gain some weight back but it would be temporary.  I gained 7/8 of those pounds back by the end of my course of steroids.

I was told by my doctor that after going up to 1mg, I should start dropping weight but I'm now at week 3 of 1mg and haven't really dropped any extra weight. I'm staying steady at around 14/15lbs weight loss over 4 months in total. At this point, I'm just maintaining, not gaining or losing anything.

Ozempic,,1ody1xq,What’s a polite way to ask people not to comment on your weight?,"I’m nervous to post this as I’ve never talked about it openly before, but I need some advice. I’ve started on Ozempic recently and I’m beginning to lose weight, and people are starting to notice and comment on it. This makes me extremely uncomfortable. Some context: I (30F) have struggled with my weight and body image all my life. I was overweight throughout my childhood, and when I was about 16, my self-esteem was at an all-time low and I started starving myself. That soon turned into binging and purging and I was in a really bad place. I lost a lot of weight, my hair was falling out, my skin and nails were paper thin and I felt like I was going to pass out 90% of the time. And all everyone kept saying – friends, family, teachers – was how fantastic I looked. It made me feel awful because they weren’t complimenting me, they were complimenting my illness. Now, over a decade later, I’m losing weight in a healthy way, and I’m doing it for my own wellbeing rather than out of insecurity. But the problem is, when people tell me how ‘great’ I look now because I’ve lost weight, it takes me straight back to that dark place I was in. It makes me think that if they’re noticing my body has changed, they must have been looking at my body before and judging it. I know people think they’re being nice, and they get confused when I react by getting flustered and uncomfortable. I don’t want to be rude to them, I just need a nice way of saying it’s none of their business and I don’t want to talk about it. I thought this would be a good place to ask – has anyone else had a similar experience, and if so, do you have any advice for what I could say to them?",46.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1ody1xq/whats_a_polite_way_to_ask_people_not_to_comment/,Dafeebs,2025-10-23 01:44:28,132.0,post,,,

It left such an impact on me, that we all complimented and were happy that she was doing well, when in fact she was very ill. How warped our sense of what a body was supposed to look like, to the point where we all thought she was healthy? It made me question everything.

Our culture judges women by their appearance much more than men ... but it still happens to men.

When someone mentions my weight loss, I believe that they almost always mean well. They want to compliment me, to encourage me, and to acknowledge my effort. So, even though I am uncomfortable, I don't want to give them a hostile reaction.

What I typically do is to give them a pensive but appreciative half-smile (to acknowledge their good intentions), say ""thanks"" without exuberance nor sarcasm, and then change the subject.

Depending on my mood, I might opt for humor, saying something like, ""Yes, I lost some weight, so you should be careful that you don't *find* it!""

Sometimes, they (usually family or close friends) still ask me questions about my diet, exercise, or medications. I am often comfortable discussing it with people to whom I am close, but when I am not, then I have to be more assertive and say something like, ""I appreciate your concern for my health, but I am not really comfortable discussing my weight right now. I hope you understand."" That usually does the trick. They mean well, after all.

And for strangers or people who do not mean well, I usually just ignore their comments or questions about my weight and remove myself from the situation. 

Sorry for the wall of text. I hope there is something in there that you can use. 😊

I’m 50. At 42 (a fit as fuck 42, built like a super hero) I had a heart attack. My LAD was 98% blocked, RCA was 90%. Got stents.  Then at 47 had a quad bypass. It’s genetics.  My dad’s side of the family fucked me over on heart stuff.

Even on meds, a low carb/high protein diet, also high with good fats, my LDL was always in the 150’s, HDL would never be above 30, and my triglycerides.  Good lord the triglycerides. They were always…ALWAYS in the 400 to 1000 range. I didn’t mistype that. If I had a glass of wine, a shot of rum, a single cup of icecream, I’d blow out the tests.  Super strict diet could only get me to the 400’s. On tricor, zetia, vascepa, atorvistatin, red yeast rice, cod liver oil, basically all the things.  My blood was basically maple syrup. I logged/journaled everything that went into my mouth. 

A doc added metformin to help with the tris.  That helped some, got me to below 300.  Then i went to a compound pharmacy.  Got on ozempic. 

Holy crap.  My total cholesterol is below 100. My LDL is around 50.  My tris are around 65.  

My cholesterol is basically to the point where my arteries are recovering and opening back up. 

I’m gonna live. I’m gonna be there for my kids.  I’ll get to grow old with my wife.  You gotta understand: in 2022, I knew, KNEW, I was about to die. A voice kept telling me, “make peace. Enjoy these birthdays and this Christmas. It’s your last one.”  That, along with exercise induced chest pains, got me into my cardiologist and landed me under the knife…well, knife, bone saw, whatever.  

Now, that voice is quiet.  I kinda miss it. It would drown out the tinnitus. 🤣

Insurance hasn’t covered it for me.  I’m going grey market.  I’ve got about two years worth sitting in the fridge (powdered form, waiting to be rehydrated). 

Goal is to stay on the grey market sources until they release generics.",32.0

The wegovy just turns off the food noise and caps my consumption to a ""normal"" serving size and I'm not wanting desert after.

Ozempic,,1oe0rep,Upper stomach pain,Last night my husband and I went on a date night. We had Chinese food. I ate very little because I knew we were going somewhere for dessert and I didn’t want to overdo it. I felt fine after I ate - we played at the casino for a bit then walked 15 minutes to do a dessert place. We shared an ice cream crepe. Again I didn’t much. When we were leaving the restaurant I got the absolute worst pain in my upper stomach - right below my sternum. I literally felt like it hurt to take a deep breath. It last maybe 5 mins - I could barely walk. Then it went away 🤷🏻‍♀️. I’m only taking 0.5mg and been on this dose for about 6 weeks. Has anyone experienced this before? I’m wondering if it may not even be related to the ozempic. Also wondering if maybe my side effects are getting worse because the dose is “building up” in my system if that is even a thing. ,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1oe0rep/upper_stomach_pain/,ttc902,2025-10-23 04:29:26,16.0,post,,,

Ozempic,,1od8lf9,70 lbs down.,"Imagine. I began this year at 305 lbs. In March, I went to a cardiologist appointment because I was having chest pain. I could barely walk up a flight of stairs at that point. 
I was super lazy, unmotivated, depressed, my diabetes was completely out of control, and I was diagnosed with PCOS and only having 2-3 periods a year. 

My doctor suggested I try Ozempic, and once my insurance kicked in, I started taking it. Instantly, all of that constant food noise was removed. All of the obsessions, counting down the minutes until my next meal, seeing food and salivating over it, thinking of restaurants nearby and planning meals any time someone mentioned meeting up anywhere.. it was all gone. The food obsession that I’ve had since I was a child - instantly removed. I never knew that it wasn’t normal to think about and obsess about food 24/7, because that’s all I had ever known. 

From there I began eating normally. Smaller portions, tracking and counting calories, began doing HIIT cardio fitness workouts on YouTube in my living room,  and then began walking and hiking more (on flat ground) before deciding that I was going to tackle a whole entire 6,000 foot mountain - Mount Washington. And I did it. Then I tackled 3,000 foot Mount Sutton, and now I already can’t wait to get on my next mountain (and challenge!), and now I am down 70 lbs. 

My periods have returned monthly, my sugar is completely under control, the depression and unmotivation are completely gone. I no longer feel sick every day, or like I hate myself, or as if I am simply surviving through life - but I feel proud of myself and like I am actually LIVING life now. 

Through both hard work and ozempic, I’ve managed to turn my life around this year. My only regret is not doing this sooner, accepting I had a food addiction sooner and getting help for it. Imagine where/who I could have been today? I won’t dwell on that though, because I’ll get there. I already can’t wait to see what next year holds for me!",292.0,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1od8lf9,Saffehish,2025-10-22 06:40:51,10.0,post,,,

Ozempic,,1ods011,Amazing results.,"Hi. No pictures yet but I want to brag about my success story. 
I’m a mom of 2 my daughter who’s 7, and my stepson who’s 9. 
I developed heart failure at the age of 24 in 2020 which was progressed by covid and when I found out I was in stage 4 with an EF of 5%. 
Recently I went to the hospital for having a large cyst/abscess under my right breast. Got it drained but developed sepsis and found out my glucose was over 400. My sugar has never been that high nor have I ever been diabetic. 
I’ve been on a few new meds including Ozempic. My starting dose was set to 0.5 weekly. My first dose was on 09/19/2025 with a starting weight of 260>. 
My morning weigh in for today 10/22/2025 231. It has all been dropping off. I suspect it’s a lot of water weight that hasn’t been leaving. I’m incredibly amazed both results when I’m only 1 month in.

I don’t want to go back to being overweight, I had so many healthy problems and was sick all the time but I honestly don’t know what to do.

In terms of time efficiency and VO2 max training, HIIT is great, but an hour of steady state cardio would burn far more and be less taxing in terms of recovery.

It's extremely challenging to look at exercise as a solution for eating more than your TDEE (this is coming from a guy with a big appetite who also does tons of cardio). It takes an hour to burn 600 calories on incline treadmill, but only 5 minutes to eat it back.

My best advice if you go the non-Ozempic route is to try things such as intermittent fasting, higher volume foods, or even lean into artificial sweeteners.

To answer your question more directly: It seems like you're fairly close to your goal/ ideal weight already. You would only need to cut out 100-200 calories a day to drop the 4kg in a reasonable amount of time, which I believe is very feasible without Ozempic (quick napkin math says if you eat less/ exercise more by 200 daily kcals, you'd reach your original weight in just under half a year). Of course this is up to your own discretion. Many use Ozempic as a lifelong drug.",4.0

I found that greasy food, sugary food and fast food made me nauseous, especially at first. I also found that was once a normal portion (2 eggs) became one egg too many. I also found that high fiber food made me feel really good (oatmeal, fruit, veg) and kept things running smoothly, but only in very small portions at first. Choosing foods from the Mediterranean diet worked as a good road map. 

You’ll want to experiment because everyone is different. You’ll also want to wait an hour after eating something to see how you feel. Maybe drink a few ounces of the drink you like and see how it goes. All good?  Drink a bit more. 

I am of the opinion that making sure you get enough calories is important long term but perhaps not at first. The important thing will be learning how to eat and still feel good because if you don’t you may get frustrated and quit. Learning to like whole foods isn’t a bad idea in any event.

Not everybody deals with the nausea, but I got some less drowsy Dramamine and it’s helped a few times I needed it.

The same with the stool softener, but I find that a lot of people definitely need it especially as we’re learning new eating habits

Water. Lots of water definitely helps.


And don’t forget to eat. 

I was forgetting to eat a lot in the beginning, even if it’s something like 15 almonds and a piece of cheese, something is better than nothing.

Glucerna or appropriate protein shake of choice really helped as well.

Small walks every day – depending on your exercise abilities. Do what’s best for you.

Ozempic,,1odmgm5,New to Ozempic Use- tips & tricks?,,,,GabrielHunter,2025-10-23 02:25:52,,comment,nkxf6yp,"Tbh I didn't change what I eat when I started out, but I was already eating pretty healthy. Still eat my pizza if the time calls for it, but ozempic made me eat only like half now.
Thr biggest trouble I have still is knowing when to stop eating. Cause if I eat my old portion I will get bad reflux and stomach pain cause its to much now. So eat slowly and start with half a portion and see if you are full after that.
Also start tracking calories at least for a while to check that you don't under eat. If you dont feel like you can manage your minimum i take, eat nuts. They are small but calorie dense.
I didn't have much negativ side effects on the starting dose so far. A little nauseous in the first week and I didn't feel much thirst but nothing after the first week",1.0
Ozempic,,1odu2kx,Hiccups,"I've plateaued (still using) but I think hiccups are related to using Ozempic. 

Not just normal diaphragm spasms but I've had a drink (liquid) or food. For drinks it can be a few sips at once, for food it's after about 3 bites. It can also be because I've laid down for bed. 

I sound like a drunk sailor randomly throughout my day. Anyone else?

Edit to add, I just got out of bed - going vertical caused a few ""light"" hiccups. Another trigger to have them. ",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ozempic/comments/1odu2kx/hiccups/,chr15713,2025-10-22 21:33:09,2.0,post,,,

Ozempic,,1odt3zk,Body function returning normal after stopping,Hey! I’ve heard from others it’s taken a couple months (mainly 2) for bodily functions like periods or constipation to not be delayed and return back to a normal state and was curious if anyone has insight on that after they’ve stopped. The last time I used it was early August because I felt comfortable to stop and some of the symptoms like nausea were taking too great of a toll.

A friend recommended Zappy program early on, and that gave me the push I needed to get serious. Since then, it’s been about consistency, managing the mindset, and focusing on progress instead of perfection.

Wegovy,,1oh7a8q,"0.25 MG Wegovy, I loved you but I must move on to 0.50 .","I am extremely proud of myself ! It definitely hasn't been easy, but I have so much more energy now . I'm more confident. I'm also only taking 1 blood pressure medication ! Where as before ( just 4 weeks and 1 day ago ! ) , when I was 271.9, I had to take 3 different blood pressure medications a day, and now I only take 1 Blood Pressure Medication a day ! Bonus, all my labs look great, and my A1.C is now looking beautiful! 

So, I want to be completely transparent and honest. I was/am/always have been a HUGE BINGER/BINGE EATER !
It was so bad on/to me in numerous ways, including but not limited to , mentally,  spiritually,  emotionally,  and financially. As in while eating 1 meal, I would already be eagerly anticipating my next meal and/or snack. 

Especially at night, after I put my youngin to bed. I would just eat and eat and eat . To the point that my stomach would be in so much pain , and most nights I would throw up ( Not on purpose, definitely not bulimia, instead i would throw up because I had over stuffed my stomach because I obviously ate way too much ) even still I would continue to eat. I wouldn't eat out for real , actual hunger , but because food helped me feel better and mask/hide my emotions from everything I had gone through.  

I've noticed that I'm much more patient, empathetic, and compassionate, and I also give myself more grace , not just with my toddler but also with complete strangers! I smile all the time, and folks reciprocate with smiles and small talk !

 Most importantly ( at least, to me ) is that I'm a much better and healthier mother to my very strong-willed ,very loved, very much always wanted, very active, 3 year old toddler, lol . Now, I can actively play with him ! Including chasing him, hide and seek, running up and down, and all over playgrounds with him, going all over the zoo, etc . All things I couldn't hardly be active for more than 10 minutes ! 

 Honestly, I think several different things/lifestyle changes/ daily exercise/meal planning , loghing , charting, and tracking everything in MyNetDiary APP.  As well as meal prep/plus my Miraculous , Glorious, Wegovy - I did 0.25 MG for 4 weeks , 

The last 7-10 days on the 0.25 mg were the absolute hardest because the ""food noise "" started to creep back in , which also coincided with my ovulation. 

I did have a follow up with my PCP Dr , She's amazing and we discussed any/all side effects and i let her know that,  while yes I lost weight,  my "" food noise "" was coming back with a vengeance.  So I agreed to go up to the next dose. Which is 0.50 1X a week . So far, it's been nothing short of a miracle gor me ! I have another follow-up with my PCP Dr on 12/22/2025. And I'm determined to lose another at least 25-40lbs a month before I see her 

All combined are the reason why I'm happier, healthier and why I have more patience now as a woman and a SMBC ( SOLO MOTHER BY CHOICE) who in just 4 weeks 1 day has lost a total of 31.3 lbs !!! 

Started- 

September 27th, 2026, 271.9 lbs

Now-

10/26/2025-  240.3 lbs !!! 

That's  a total of 31.3 lbs in 4 weeks, 1 day !

As a huge added bonus , I'm not in as much pain , so that makes me feel tremendously better (even though it's only 31.3 lbs so far ) versus before when I was even 271.9 ! 

 I take my 3 year old on 30-minute walks 2X a day. I also take him to the park and actively play with him the entire time . While as before, I could only play a few minutes at the park with him before I had to sit down and typically sat on my phone for the rest of the time we were at the park. 

Also , even though I've lost 31.3 lbs , I don't see much of a change physically.  I'm still wearing the same clothes from 31.3 lbs ago. But , i physically feel BETTER and have more energy and more stamina!
 
I'm kinder to myself and try to remind myself that I didn't gain all this weight instantly or overnight, but it took years to get to 271.9 lbs  . So , down to 240.3 in just 4 weeks and 1 day or 29 days total ! Is AMAZING to me because I honestly never thought I would get here ! 

 I try to always have an Attitude of Gratitude because, Just like my toddler isn't going to just magically be able to control their emotions/outbursts and tantrums immediately! It takes patience,  compassion, empathy/understanding, and the ability to recognize that, unfortunately, sometimes life just isn't fair.  

For Example- 
While Betty Jo down the street eats ginormous , ungodly amounts of food ( at least when you see her ), and yet she still weighs the same as she did in high school! Ugh , that can be so triggering and devastating!  I caution you from these thoughts,  because all you have to do is remind yourself,  YOU are NOT HER ! YOU have zero clue what goes on behind closed doors ! Maybe she's depressed.  Maybe she's in an extremely abusive relationship,  or 
Maybe she has a medical condition and wishes she could GAIN weight! Maybe she's on drugs and burns through all the extra calories and then some.  Maybe she's bulimic? Maybe she had/has plastic surgery? Or on the other hand. Maybe she only eats OMAD, so it's a huge portion with a full day of calories, and you just happen to see her then . Maybe she's also on a GLP-1S. Regardless of her reasons, Please try and remind yourself that HER Journey,  HER life , Her Decision, HER LIFESTYLE, and HER CHOICE(S) and everything she chooses to consume or do is NONE of your business.  IT has NOTHING to do with you! REMEMBER IT IS NEVER OKAY TO COMMENT ON ANOTHER WOMAN'S BODY ! UNLESS/UNTILL , YOU'VE WALKED A MILE IN HER SHOES, YOU NEED TO MIND YOUR OWN BISCUITS AND YOUR LIFE WILL BE GRAVY ! 

STOP COMPARING YOURSELF/LIFE/JOURNEY to others ! We are all beautifully, uniquely ourselves 💖

COMPARISON IS THIEF OF JOY 💖

So, instead of sitting/laying around bemoaning my wasted life , I'm now ACTIVELY Participating IN MY LIFE ! I am no longer just a spectator in mine and my 3 year olds' lives ! Instead, I'm now an active and willing participant in mine, and my toddlers lives 💙

I do track and log over EVERYTHING,  including water in the MyNetDiary APP. I use the free version.  It's awesome, and I can also enter food(s) , meals, and/or drinks before I eat/drink them . That way, I'm able to stick to less than 1200 calories a day, and I can add or remove BEFORE consuming so that I don't go over ! It also has a bar code scanner that you can use ( also free) to easily see all nutrient facts, including serving size, etc .

Am wondering if anyone has been able to switch their prescription from My Rocky Pharmacy to a pharmacy that would accept my insurance up front?

Wegovy,,1ohqhc0,Just starting!,,,,squatsandthoughts,2025-10-27 14:48:25,,comment,nlpzzqa,"Acid reflux is common because of the slowed digestion. There are various methods to address it such as taking an acid reducer like famotidine (more effective than tums), Prilosec (even more effective for the longer term but you may still need famotidine or tums). Check with your doc on these. 

Adjusting how you eat or drink such as:

- Less foods that elicit more acid response such as chocolate, things with tomatoes, spicy food, carbonated beverages, etc (you can google for a full list but you don't need to cut, just lower the volume of these foods)

- Smaller meal volume when eating

- Drinking more fluids like flat water 

- Space meals out especially before laying down

Also know that stomach acid can cause nausea, which is also a common complaint with these meds. Address the nausea with an acid reducer first and if that doesn't help them go to something like Zofran if needed (talk with your doc, obviously). 

It should get better over time!",2.0

Wegovy,,1ohjw6c,3 Tiny Pulmonary Embolisms + Unexplained Heart Issues. Anyone else?? Is Wegovy the cause?!,"*Posting in case this helps someone else going through something similar — and to hear from others who’ve had a comparable experience.*

I’m a 36F. Started Wegovy in June 2025 at 175 lbs, now down to 148 lbs.

At the end of August, I went to the ER for what I thought might be kidney stones (not in severe pain, just wanted imaging sooner). During the workup, my D-dimer came back elevated, which can indicate a blood clot. That prompted a CT scan, which showed a tiny pulmonary embolism (PE) in my left lung. They also did leg ultrasounds—no other clots found. I was started on blood thinners immediately and referred to a hematologist.

The hematologist thought the PE was likely from a recent 7-hour flight and wasn’t overly worried. He planned for 3 months of blood thinners but scheduled a follow-up CT after one month. The original clot had resolved, but two new, very small clots were seen in my right lung. He wasn’t sure if they were new or missed initially (they were tiny). Either way, he extended treatment to 6 months.

Around that time, I started the highest Wegovy dose. Within a couple of weeks, I noticed shortness of breath, nausea, and headaches every hour or so, but brushed it off. After about five days, I was lying in bed one evening when my vision went woozy and started fading — I felt like I was about to faint. My husband helped me up, and my chest tightened while both calves cramped like charley horses. We called 911.

Paramedics said my vitals were mostly fine — slightly high BP and elevated pulse. They took me to the ER. EKG was clear. A third CT scan showed all previous PEs were gone. I was discharged and told to follow up with my primary care doctor.

My primary referred me to a cardiologist and ordered a brain MRI — both came back clear. My heart looked strong on the echocardiogram. But I still didn’t feel right.

Before starting Wegovy, my resting heart rate was in the 50s. It gradually increased (60s → 70s → and now in upper 80s/low 90s). After that fainting episode my pulse sometimes jumps to 110–115 while sitting. Light walking pushes it into the 120s. That's what my pulse rate would be after HIIT workout classes!! I now wake up every morning with my heart pounding and i think its generally impacting my sleep/restfuless (as confirmed by my oura ring). I constantly feel fluttering, or my heart racing, or a blood draining from my head feeling.

I’m currently wearing a Holter monitor for rhythm testing, but all other results have been “normal.” My oxygen and BP are fine, but when my heart rate spikes and then drops, I get severe headaches and nausea. My Oura ring flags “elevated resting heart rate” every day, and my Apple Watch has repeatedly alerted my husband (my emergency contact) that my ""heart rate is high while inactive for 10 + minutes"".

I just don’t feel like myself these last few weeks. The timing of the newest symptoms definitely align with starting the highest dose of wegovy - constant pounding heart, fatigue, and dizziness... but all the tests to check whats wrong keep coming back “normal.” I am also convinced that the PE's were caused by the wegovy as well and have read some similar stories on here.  Yet no doctors believe what I am going through is because of Wegovy.

Wegovy,,1oh2w26,PCOS and wegovy?,"Hi! I was recently diagnosed with PCOS and when my doctor and I discussed going forward, he recommended Wegovy since I can’t seem to lose weight (I’ve basically plateau’d). My diet is pretty decent although I could be more active for sure. When googling Wegovy, it seems a lot of people say that it helps curve their hunger — I’m not really struggling with hunger/overeating or anything like that. My question is this: are there any women here with PCOS who took Wegovy? What was your experience? Would it even help me lose weight if my diet remained the same? I’m just worried of putting it in my body only for it to not even do anything. Also, isn’t this just a short-term solution? Has anyone stopped using and retained the weight loss? Thank you so much!

Weight loss is difficult with PCOS and insulin resistance because high insulin levels promote fat storage, particularly in the abdomen, while also increasing hunger and cravings for sugary foods. Insulin resistance means cells don't respond to insulin effectively, causing the pancreas to produce more, which further drives fat storage and can lead to a cycle of elevated androgens, increased insulin resistance, and higher androgen production.

So far the first week there was nausea which I calmed down by being hydrated and sipping mint and fennel tea. I also found that injecting in my left thigh took away almost all the side effects. Also, my Dr. told me that if I find a dose effective that I dont HAVE to move up. I already got pre-approval due to high BMI and hypertension (PCOS would have been a good reason but my insurance did not cover it for it) so after .25 and .5 I get a new script from my Dr and I can stay at any level for however long I want. That was reassuring because if you struggle on a level or if its working for you there is no reason to advance. I have found after 6 weeks that the .5 is no longer as effective for me so that is why I am moving up. I had a LOT of concerns and everyone is different but making sure I am hydrated by using Liquid IV and eating small meals has really helped me and trying different injection sites.

Wegovy,,1oeunp2,WEGOBY changed my life,"I'm so happy! Because for the first time in a long time I not only lose weight, but I want and need to move.
I tell you, I am 45 years old and I have been on a diet since I was 13. I did many diets in my life, achieving a maximum weight of 118 and a minimum of 69 in all this time. 
I started when I was 13 years old and 106 kilos (I was already a fully developed girl at that age, 170 cm tall), in 6 months I lost 37 kilos, staying at 69 kg, a weight at which I was beginning to be very thin, since my doctor at that time asked me not to go below 70.
The fact is that I went up to 75 and stayed there for many years... but then life, pregnancies and my metabolism made me reach 118 kilos at the age of 45 (with a million various fluctuations over the years, 3 or 4 more diets with great weight loss, Mediterranean diet, Keto, pills... but always starting over) 
And here I am, with WEGOBY, a year ago I started with 118 kilos and I am currently at 72... it has been slow and easy, but the best thing is that it was the only descent in which my body asked me to move, first the walks, then using stairs instead of the elevator, every day more and more, I felt my body more agile and stronger and I wanted and needed to move it, then the gym came, feeling sore, feeling strength, seeing how my swollen and sore feet began to reduce inflammation and move faster, 2 days of gym a week, after 2 months go up to 3 days a week, complement it with an elliptical at home... I couldn't believe it, for the first time in my life I loved moving my body, every day I wanted more, and I felt all of this reflected on the scale and in the mirror.
Today I weigh 72, I go to the gym 3 days a week to strengthen and I eat slowly with the elliptical 2 days at home for 45 minutes. On Saturdays and Sundays I walk as much as I can and it's not just about having lost kilos, it's about feeling my body strong, connecting with it, loving it and taking care of it.

The pharmacists showed me the window and how to do the dial to .25 and to click it and wait for the click sound and it’ll click again, said the window will fill with a yellow thing and then said “watch a YouTube video to see how exactly”

So I came home and did that. Cleaned the site and put a needle on, set it to .25 and put it to my abdomen and clicked. The dial went down but it didn’t make a second click and the yellow thing never showed up in the window so I did it again. 

Finally a grey thing showed up in the window. I caped the needle and put it in the sharps box but now the grey part won’t go back down. 

Did I just give myself the whole pen? I got 1 pen and 4 needles. Now the dial won’t turn.

The multidose pens don’t have a yellow thing. You just wind up to the dose, inject it, then push and hold the button until it winds back down to zero. If you didn’t wind it up again after it got back to zero, you won’t have accidentally given extra doses. I’m not sure why the dial won’t turn, but maybe you need to have a needle on it, or maybe you’re trying to turn it the wrong way. You shouldn’t be winding it up until you’re ready to give your second dose next week. So, my suggestion would be to wait until then, and then carefully follow the instructions again - making sure they’re your own instructions, not something that came off the internet and could be for the wrong type of pen. (There’s no second click for multidose pens, and the grey thing isn’t supposed to go back down.)

ETA: I just read more carefully, and saw that you said you “did it again” after not seeing a yellow thing in the window. If by “did it again” you mean that you wound it up to .25 again and repeated the injection process, then in that case, you will have given yourself however many doses you did repeat injections for. The full .25 mg pen has four doses, which is 1.0 mg in total, if you gave all four doses at once. That’s not technically an overdose, as Wegovy can be prescribed up to a weekly dose of 2.4mg. However, you’re more likely to have side effects if you start on a higher dose. It won’t hurt you, but it may be unpleasant.",10.0

So regardless of what happens with this, don’t let it discourage you, it does get better. Get some zofran for the nausea. Hydrate like you have never before. Use Metamucil if the GI is too much.

I a bit more tired this week, but I have not been great at eating well either.   
On tuesday I demolished 2 packs of chocolate (so about 500gram in total), and then one apple.

Wegovy,,1odeuy9,My story; 4 weeks in and going strong,"As I’ve used a.o. This subreddit heavily in my decision process to start with Wegovy, I think it’s only fair if I report back to you guys as well. I’m a 54 yr, male, located in Sweden and 2 months back I’ve told by my doctor that I had to make some radical changes and loose weight as soon as possible. I will not go into the medical reasons too much,  except that he decided to support to prescribe medication. At that time my weight was around 122,5 kgs (270 lbs) with a BMI of over 40. My goal is too loose 10 kgs (22 lbs) by Xmas and 30 kgs (66 lbs) by Midsummer 2026

I took 2 weeks to reflect and analyse on which medication I wanted to take, obviously I landed on Wegovy. Mainly because of it’s ease of use, affordable pricing (Wegovy is not covered by the Swedish health insurance) and high efficacy\*\*:\*\* It prediction to be very effective for significant and sustained weight loss. next to that Systemic benefits where of consideration: Beyond weight the potential improvement of cardiovascular risk factors and may help to manage my blood pressure. 

However, what I also did in those weeks was:

* Started up a high protein, no carb, no sugar, diet supported by counting calories to make sure I would land on approx 1200-1500 Kcal per day, which I know is acceptable for me and on it’s own creates the right circumstances to loose weight. My partner is a food nutrition and she was great help in making a breakfast/lunch/dinner plan. We’re going in together on this, which helps.
* I make sure to drink; my goal is 2,5 liter per day and I keep track of both my food and water intake through the Lifesum app, which works really well together with Apple Health. 
* I stopped drinking alcohol completely, and i will do until Xmas at minimum. Most probably I’ll have a few glasses of very nice wine around the holidays and then stop again. I was a moderate but regular consumer of wine (one bottle a week)
* I started exercising at least 3 times per week. A good program set up by a former PT I still had on file, also directed to weight loss.
* I’ve started to be rigid on my sleep regime. No late night binge watching anymore. I make sure I get 7,5-8 hours sleep every night. 

In the first 2,5 weeks I lost about 4 kgs (9lbs) and then I started on Wegovy 0.25. So far so good, I’m very happy with it.  During these first 2 weeks it was managable, driven by motivation, but I had continuous food and snack cravings. Wegovy has taken that away, almost completely. Although to the end of the 7 day period the effect is decreasing, but easy to manage. I have very little cravings, and need for bigger portions. I stop eating when my body says so, even if that means food waiste. It is was it is. 

Yes I’ve had the nausea and headaches, especially on the days after I’ve injected. I manage that by injecting on Friday nights, as my Saturdays are generally for recovery anyhow. I do notice I’m a bit lower on energy, but generally I feel better. Fatty food is a problem for me, I get sick more or less directly. I had an Indian curry 2 weeks ago and that didn’t go down very well. Reflux is a bit more troublesome then before, especially at night I find myself needing to take a Gaviscon tablet, other stomach protectors don’t really do anything for me. I do allow myself my guilty pleasure (licorice, lakrits) but max 2 pieces a day, a not a full bag.

What I accomplished so far (about 6 weeks in, including. 4 Wegovy 0.25 mg injections)

* I lost in total 7.1 kgs (15.6 lbs) and my BMW is down to 37
* My blood pressure is slowly improving (I’ve got hypertensia), 
* so is my digestion and my stool
* I fart much less.
* I sleep like a baby, with much little days of elevated apnea risk
* I’m down one size in clothing, my pointy beer belly is slowly decreasing.

I feel much better in general and people around me start to spot the difference, which is rewarding. This Friday I’ll start with 0,5 mg, I’

I’m comfortable with this approach and I’m very motivated to make a change. I find it easier to keep up with Wegovy, and (so far) little risk on fall backs.  With a regular diet I would make it about this time in and that it would start to slide. I‘m pretty sure that it’s the combination of factors which make me loose about 1,2 kg per week.

This is my story, I wanted to share it as a tribute to all of you sharing. I’m happy to take questions, and will report back in a couple of weeks after the 0.5mg series.

Instead, they’re sending over a form for my doctor to fill out for Mounjaro. I’ll be completely honest in saying I have a negative association with Mounjaro for reasons I don’t know - I’m not sure if it’s because I heard something or read something negative, but I can’t shake the feeling that this isn’t the right drug for me. My issue is I have nothing to back that up. The Wegovy was prescribed for a) weight loss to help with a former knee and leg injury, and b) due to concerns of a binge eating disorder. My concern I think is stemming from Mounjaro being used for diabetic patients, which I have been screened for and do not have any indicators in even at risk (my mom is diabetic so there were initial concerns there as well).

If anyone has experience either swapping from Wegovy or even other drugs to Mounjaro, or even just advice from people who have solely been on Mounjaro, please share your experiences with me. Any and all advice is appreciated ☺️🩵",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Wegovy/comments/1ocqljj/swapping_from_wegovy_to_mounjaro_thoughts/,-Sul-Sul-,2025-10-21 15:06:36,5.0,post,,,

Wegovy,,1oclx94,Wegovy and Antibiotics,I started Wegovy 19 months ago. I have been fortunate to have few side effects. Mostly constipation. But since starting I have been prescribed antibiotics three times. Each time I have become so terribly ill with 24 hours of vomiting.  Antibiotics have always cause some GI issues and nausea. But in all three cases I was unable to take more than one dose of the antibiotic. My doctor seems only passively curious about whether Wegovy is impacting my ability to tolerate antibiotics. But I am feeling pretty confident that is what's happening and am eager to hear from others if you have had a similar challenges with antibiotics.

Tummy troubles? Double check. Delt with diarrhea for the first 2 months and now have constipation like I’ve never had before.

General fatigue? Check. And I know that’s not uncommon since I’m in a calorie deficit but it feels absolutely awful.

Wegovy,,1obo7bz,Ten months! 224 to 157. My(30s f) BMI is finally “normal”!,"Just here to say this stuff rocks. I’m a woman, early 30’s, 5’7. Aside from my butt being a little deflated these days, I couldn’t be happier with the results so far. I’m aiming for 140lbs, but might go smaller if I feel like I want to. My target was to hit that by 6/2026 as you can see on the screenshot, but it looks like I’ll hit it in early January! I’ve tried to focus on protein and healthy food, but I admit that I’m not always perfect. I eat about one meal a day— not because i necessarily want to, that’s just all my stomach seems to have room for now. My blood pressure is quite low and sometimes I get a little faint when I stand up after being down for a while, but that’s how I was as a teenager too and my doc isn’t worried. 

The weight loss is awesome and I’m so stoked to be under 160! But what I really care about is the fact that I’m within a “normal” bmi range. That was my goal post these last ten months. Now I’m here and can start focusing on building a buffer zone of weight fluctuation (and there are a lot thanks to my cycle)!

I can’t wait to have these last 17pounds gone, move to a maintenance dose, and hopefully get a little of my butt back, haha. I have PCOS and did everything right re: health, and still couldn’t lose weight. This stuff was a miracle for me. I have regular periods now. I physically feel younger. So many aches and pains are just gone. I’m not ashamed to be seen by old friends or be in family pics like I was before. I’m so thankful.

Wegovy,,1obo9fs,Restarting after surgery,"Restarting after surgery

I had to have my gallbladder removed so I had to stop wegovy for about 4 weeks. My pharmacist told me that because I was only off at for 4 weeks I could go back up to my dose 2.4
I did this and luckily for me I had minimal side effects other than the occasional nausea. 

I've been on 2.4 again for 5 weeks and not seeing nearly as much of an effect as it did the first time.

Has anyone stopped the medication for whatever reason and then restarted? Does it take longer to see the effects?

For the last two months, I was at 2.4mg. I experienced intense episodes of vomiting and diarrhea, like every week I had one episode.  This weekI decided that it was enough, and I called the pharmacist to ask him to go back to 1.7mg.

 I'm afraid it won't work anymore since I was at 2.4 mg for 8 weeks.

So I applied for Wegovy based on the FDA announcement for cardiovascular risk reduction. I had and widowmaker and stent 3 years ago.

DENIED. Internal appeal denied. It was denied based on my insurance classing Wegovy as weightloss, not taking into account recent studies and the FDA announcement. My policy does not cover weight loss.

So I upload all my my medical history, the insurance coverage requirements, pharmacy benefits managers requirement, support documents from my pharmacist, and anything else i could find to GeminiAI. It created a better worded, accurate, well structured appeal than i could ever do.

Submitted to the independent external review body yesterday. And was told it would take 30 days to review.

I received a phone call off my insurance today, the external review approved my appeal and I have been approved for coverage for 6 months with a review with my cardiologist after to see if i want to continue.

I think it is worthwhile even if you have to pay $6,000/year out of pocket for several reasons. With the weight you will likely lose you will feel better and feel better about yourself. You may save money on food, particularly eating out. You may save money on costs associated with comorbidities of being overweight like lost work time.

The harsh reality is that skinny people don't face the same discrimination as fat people in the US. There's a good chance you will find your income increasing when you slim down, possibly enough to offset the cost of the drug.

Keep in mind that this is a lifetime drug. You have to prepare for the possibility that you'll be paying $6,000 / year for the rest of your life, though it's likely that the price will fall over time and possible that your insurance may cover it someday.",1.0

Wegovy,,1o80qww,"Finally some good news , Wegovy price dropped to £79 🙌","Hey folks,
Just wanted to share a bit of good news today. I’ve been on GLP-1 meds for a while ,  started with Mounjaro, but switched to Wegovy after the Mounjaro price hike. Cost was becoming a real issue, and since GLP-1s are honestly life-saving for me, I had to find something more affordable.
This morning I saw that my provider (SheMed) dropped the Wegovy price to £79, and with a discount code it’s even cheaper. I’m genuinely so happy ,  feels like I made the right call switching.
GLP-1s have completely changed how I manage my appetite and energy ,  I finally feel in control again. Wegovy has been steady for me with minimal side effects and great results so far.
Just wanted to share because it’s rare to see prices actually go down these days 😅 Anyone else notice the drop or switch providers lately?

Wegovy,,1o7zydp,Skin sensitivity and redness on the face?,"So I've done some searching but can't seem to find others talking about this specifically and I wanted to see if anyone else has experienced this.

I'm currently on Week 9 and for the first 8 weeks I had absolutely zero side effects. This week, I moved up to 1mg. I had my shot on Monday and everything seemed fine. Then, on Tuesday night when I was removing my makeup before bed, I noticed that my face (particularly around my cheeks and jawline) was really sensitive to the touch. I was a bit confused at first, but some research showed me that skin sensitivity is a lesser-known side effect, so I didn't worry too much. 

Yesterday (Wednesday) it eased up a bit, but my face was still a bit sensitive.

Today (Thursday) while washing my hands, I looked up at the mirror and noticed that my cheeks were quite red (like id just been exercising) and the skin on them looked more bumpy and textured than usual. Sensitivity levels have stayed the same since yesterday.

I think what's freaking me out a bit is that I can't seem to find anyone else who has had this sort of thing localized just to their face. I'm hoping it's just my body adapting to the higher dosage and everything will be fine, because I don't want to have to stop the medication, but if anyone else has similar experiences, please share!

Wegovy,,1o7vnkl,Old fridge secretly froze my Wegovy... could that explain weaker results?,"My fridge is more than 10 years old, and recently I found out that the actual temperature inside is very different from what I set.

I usually keep it at 3–4°C and it seemed fine most of the time, but when I tested it with a fridge thermometer (that shows min/max/current), I was shocked—it sometimes dropped below freezing, like –1 to –2°C. One day it even went down to –7°C.

To double-check, I put in two more thermometers, and yes, it really was freezing inside. Interestingly, nothing in the fridge looked frozen, and my Wegovy pens didn’t show any obvious signs of being damaged. I kept using them and still noticed some effect.

But when I searched Reddit, a lot of people said the same thing: it doesn’t harm your body, but the medication might lose effectiveness if it freezes and thaws repeatedly. That made me wonder—maybe the reason I didn’t see as strong results before was because my Wegovy had been freezing on and off without me realizing.

So I decided to buy a brand-new fridge. Now the temperature is super stable. I just bought a new supply of Wegovy, and I’m going to test it again. Part of me can’t help but suspect that last year, my pens were already compromised because of my old fridge.

I suggest that you take it at night before you go to bed. For me, that means I won't be very hungry in the morning and I won't overeat that day. Overeating seems to be ""the thing"" that triggers me getting sick. 

When I titrated up to 1.7, I took it in the AM (like I had always been doing) and 24 hours I was a mess. I switched to the night and all those issues went away.

But odds are, you'll be somewhat nauseous. It affects a lot of people that way. It goes away but it's not fun. Have some pepto or your favorite nausea medicine on hand and you should do fine.

I actually switched from Mounjaro to Wegovy, and yeah, I did notice some side effects in the beginning; nausea, a bit of queasiness, but that’s pretty common and tends to ease up over time. Everyone reacts a little differently, so don’t worry if your experience isn’t exactly like mine. One thing that helped me was reading up on [managing](https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/drugs-wegovy-side-effects#managing-side-effects) side effects online and pairing the medication with good lifestyle [habits](https://www.pharmacyuk.com/can-lifestyle-changes-enhance-glp-1-drug-efficacy/), balanced meals, staying hydrated, and listening to your body.

Many of us will experience similar things, but maybe at different times. For a few weeks fatigue was kicking my butt. That seems to be better the last week or two. I've made the move up to each successive dose every four weeks. 1.7 is my current dose and I decided to stay on it for another month because I had more side effects. 

One thing it helps me to keep in mind is that this is a marathon, not a sprint. This is likely a lifetime drug for me. The data indicate that very few people who go off GLP-1's can maintain the lifestyle changes they made and most will gain the weight back. Recognizing that you're on this for the long haul can help you make better decisions about progress. It doesn't all have to happen at once.",2.0

It’s not therapeutic. You will need time to get to a dose that will be effective for you. 
Someone once mentioned the paper towel theory and it’s so true. Weightloss is slow and steady. You won’t see the results in the beginning till the roll gets smaller and smaller and each lb off looks more drastic. 
Sure my hunger switch got turned down when I started (1.5 years ago and 55lbs lost) but I didn’t lose a lot in the beginning. When the 5-7lbs started coming off slowly over 1-2 months I still didn’t see results in the mirror. 7 months in and one day I legitimately felt like I was looking at someone completely different in the mirror and I was only 35lbs down. I bought so many pairs of jeans bc I couldn’t  remembered the last time I felt good about putting on a pair. And in 2 months I didn’t fit any of those jeans I had just bought.

Wegovy,,1o6xwjo,Rectal bleeding this morning,"My doctor started me on .25 wegovy  a couple of months ago. for the first two or three weeks, It was unbearable. The diarrhea and cramping was so bad I thought I was going to literally shit my own body weight out
Sorry guys I don’t mean to be crude, but it was really bad. I realized I wasn’t drinking enough water and so I stepped up my game. Within a week or so the diarrhea cleared up and I was good to go. 
For context, my original weight was probably about 140 pounds and I’m 5’3 56 years old.  My doctor told me I have insulin resistance and I was pre-diabetic. She asked me if I wanted to go on a GLP one and so I said Yes of course! The idea of having to inject myself with insulin is just not in the cards for me and my brother has diabetes. I I didn’t want to go down that road. 
Cut to last week when i went to pick up my regular prescription and realized that I needed to go up in dosage because I’ve been on the .25 for three months already. 
I called my doctors office to ask them if they can increase my dosage but had to leave a message on the voicemail because nobody was there to answer the phone. By the way, my prescribing doctor not only gives weight loss injections in her office, but she gives Botox and also other cosmetic procedures. I know from experience of dealing with her for other issues that the office are notorious for not following up with their patients. So my voicemail basically said that I was wondering why the dosage hadn’t been increased and I asked if they could call it in. When I went to the CVS to pick up my prescription I noticed that it was not the half milligram that I expected, but it was a 1 mg size. Doing a quick Google search I realized that they probably put me on the 1 mg and skipped the normal titration of .5 mg because it is now three months in and I figured this is standard procedure. 
So this past Friday, I injected myself with the 1 mg and felt fine up until last night about 9 PM where I had insane stomach cramps. They were so bad. I honestly thought I was going to pass out the diarrhea kept coming and coming and coming and didn’t stop. I actually called 911 because my mother who lives with me is hard of hearing and I was afraid if I suddenly passed out or hit my head that nobody would hear me. My fingers were cold. My toes were cold and I was close to hyperventilating at this point. Long story short the ambulance came. They did a blood sugar check on me and it all checked out fine. They asked me what medications I was on which isn’t a lot of meds but they did their job and even waited for me while I had to go back into the bathroom and have more diarrhea. After they left, I started to feel a little bit better. I went to bed, but I couldn’t really sleep was still having a little bit of cramping, but it wasn’t terrible. I was able to get up and I ate a slice of banana bread around 2 am. A few hours later I felt very gassy and figured I just had to fart and after I did that I couldn’t believe what I felt next which I thought was me just shitting my pants.. turns out I had passed an actual blood clot out of my butt! 

I had my brother take me to the ER about 5 AM. The nurses hooked me up to an IV and a Dr had to probe my ass to see if there were any hemorrhoids or polyps that may have caused this. Well, none were found. The doctor told me I had a low white blood cell count, and that I should probably go and get a colonoscopy because I do have a history of it on my Mothers side. 

I’m posting this for anyone whose doctors may have skipped the regular titration protocol. If you find that this happens to you, please question their reasoning for skipping the smaller dosages. I am so enraged that a physician would be so careless as to authorize a prescription and not consider dosing accordingly. I will never take this drug again!!

*What's changed?*

I don't cry before leaving the house anymore because nothing fits or I feel like a bulging swamp monster with a dunlap. Now, I can go out in my ""given up on life pants"" and still feel great about how I look. I don't hide behind makeup anymore, I don't even feel like I need it, as I feel good enough about my appearance as I am. 

Funny how losing 100 lbs felt like gaining self-esteem, self-confidence, and self-worth. I lost weight and gained the superpower of going into public and not feeling like people are staring at me because of my size or my self-loathing. 

I spent many years overcompensating because of all the fear that came with being fat. I missed so many opportunities and I was such a wallflower because I was afraid of judgement. However, it is probably a good thing I never knew what it was like to be thin before now, as my kindness towards others was shaped by years of always being the fat girl. 

*My big advice?* 

My advice isn't about any of the nuances involved with glp1s, it's about documenting your journey. Get right up in front when someone in the group holds up their cellphone to snap a pic. You'll cherish those photos, both because you will have something to judge your progress by... but also because you will have lived in the moment. 

Don't let the fear of being fat stop you from living.

Coming from someone who has been 100% about this life for an entire year: take selfies and ask others to snap your pics. Especially at the beginning, it will keep you motivated as you reflect on your journey.",385.0,https://v.redd.it/655rfiqygrxf1,1-900OkFace,2025-10-27 19:10:32,40.0,post,,,

You do not have the physical ability to leap into any kind of strenuous exercise given the amount of weight you are carrying for your height. While exercise is helpful  and good for you, you need to mainly focus on your intake and maintaining a caloric deficit.

As a side note,  your doctor is not quite correct. SG will work powerfully to flatten hunger and ""food noise"" even if you don't exercise. Given your current weight, if you reduce your calories to (say) 1600 a day, you will lose around 2-3 lbs a week whether you exercise or not, just from the caloric deficit of your reduced intake vs what's required to support your current weight.  Even without any substantive exercise the weight is going to fall off.  When you push ino the mid 200's you can take exercise intensity up a notch. For now, carrying around 310 lbs is enough of a workout, in and of itself for someone your size.",21.0

I started semaglutide in January and I have been having great results (I've lost a little over 50 lbs.). In June, I started to notice I was losing A LOT of hair.  This went on for months, and I could feel my hair was getting a bit thinner. The shedding was crazy, and SO much was coming out in the shower. I've always had pretty thick and long hair, so it was starting to really worry me. My wife was diagnosed with PCOS and Diabetes a couple of years ago, and lost a lot of hair in a much more noticeable way. Since starting Nutrafol about a month ago, I've noticed less shedding and less hair loss in the shower. My wife has been on it for 2 months, and her hairdresser commented on some hair regrowth. She is also shedding much less. 

If you're having hair loss, so far I would recommend this product even though it's on the pricey side. It's been a huge relief to feel like I'm not going to lose my hair ",11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1ohx3iz/hair_loss_nutrafol/,VirgoRomantics,2025-10-27 18:46:33,24.0,post,,,

Side effects are waaay worse, but I’ve learned how to manage most of them.  I never thought I’d ever be under 200lbs let alone approaching 185 quickly.  

Also how do you know when to stop. Will your body just be like “yo, hold up we good” or is it a personal preference.  I’m down to 188 now and a medium/large - which lemme tell you the mindset from being a 24/26 and 3x to a medium and large is mind blowing. Plus free people dupes fit finally lol 

Thanks for your support - even tho I’m usually silent, I feel all the love and support you show one another.  

There are very few days I see it and I’m still wary of buying clothes in a size that used to make me very uncomfortable to even think of attached or some photos of my evolution to my new self. I still do not feel comfortable in my own skin and don’t trust people when they tell me that I look great because all I can see is a sagging skin and a face that finally looks my age of 51.  Up until I lost the weight my chubby face I think made me look younger but now that I’ve lost the weight. I’ve lost the elasticity in my face and I just feel like I’ve aged 20 years in the last 14 months.

If anybody has any advice on how to get over these struggles, I would greatly appreciate it. My doctor that I see every Friday has helped me work through some of it where he put it into perspective stating that my eyes and brain have seen 305 pounds for 20+ years and for the last I don’t know, maybe 10 months my eyes have seen something totally different than what my brain is used to seeing and my brain just can’t see it.

In my case it was necessary- I was getting the surgery by the time I did no matter what, but losing what I could before significantly reduced my risks.  I was in significant pain which got worse and worse and I could barely walk towards the end. I was balancing sides of physical health- doing it that fast was not good. Not being able to walk, move, and struggling to sleep was worse. 

I did it with careful medical overview. I also did get diagnosed with ADHD and started medication at the same time, which really helped. Those medications are appetite suppressing and also manage impulsivity and any inclinations to binging. I tried really hard to focus on protein. If I could have added in exercise, that would have been better. I took vitamins daily and got frequent bloodwork to make sure my kidneys, liver, etc. were okay. I actually felt pretty good during. 

Results- it's hard to separate things out because I got a hip replacement. It was a massive relief and I went from lots of constant pain to none. Still, my body after is just different. 

I have lost a lot of muscle. I know this isn't going to be relevant to you if you're getting a hysterectomy, but I screwed up my menstrual cycle. I needed to get an IUD after 6 months of bleeding. My hair was falling out. I needed to get medication for that, which is helping. I absolutely killed my endurance, but that could be the lack of exercise as well. I really needed to build muscle back up after, which paused weight loss for about 18 months. I can start working on losing more now, but I need to really focus on maintaining the muscles I worked to get back. I had some concerning kidney results in bloodwork, but that seems to have worked out. I don't think it's done loose skin any favors, but I don't care that much about that. I think, based on science, that I may have done irreversible harm to my metabolism. But I also have hypothyroidism, so it wasn't in great shape to begin with. And being our weight has to have done damage anyway? Who knows. 

I have to add in- I also spoke to my psychiatrist in depth. I don't seem to have much inclination to anorexia or other EDs. Maybe a little towards binging, but not in adulthood. That was a big issue- it would be very risky to do this if you have those issues, as many many people do. I can see why. Once I got into the pattern, it was harder to remember to eat than to avoid. I also could have lived easily off protein drinks for the most part if I didn't have to cook and eat with my husband and kid. But again, the pain. I was going as quick as I could and running against a situation that was progressively getting worse and worse. 

Another concern- my hip is right on the surface due to how I am built. Losing muscle (it was fucked up in that area beforehand anyway) and maintaining fat deposits is maybe less of an issue than it would be with abdominal surgery. My doctor also went through the risks and what he was concerned about in great detail. He also said he would do it at any weight I could manage when I got desperate and do the best he could. Knowing what I was doing and why made a huge mental difference. It somehow changed things from the usual 'moral failing, self-control' dark mental fog many of us fat people occupy when we think about weight loss, to a medical thing for me, without all that emotional weight. That was a huge thing. 

So can you? Yes, probably. Should you? Not if you don't absolutely have to. But find out if you have to and made decisions based on that.",6.0

The volume of a cup size depends on the band size, say you are a 40 DD and you go to a 32 DD, your cup size would have remained the same but the actual volume of your boob will be much smaller, the cup size is relative to the band size 

For myself as I have lost weight this time, My cup size has stayed steady as my band has gone down some, so my boobs while smaller in volume are the same relative size to my shrinking size if that makes sense",2.0

We prefer the ready to drink shakes, but many prefer the powder for the versatility of adding to other foods. 

Protein/fiber bars. Again, lots to choose from. Our current favorite is Ready Clean in every flavor. 

Protein snacks. Cheese, yogurt, nuts and seeds. I really love roasted & salted soybeans or edamame for a salty, crunchy snack. 

Popcicles. We love Outside no sugar added popcicles. You can make your own using sugar free drink mix and flavor drops and a fresh fruit and fruit juice. They're not only convenient, but they're easy to eat with a touchy tummy. 

Meat. We buy ground beef, porkchop, beef roast or stew meat, ham or bacon, chicken breasts, and turkey breast and cook it all. This gives my hubby easy microwavable protein for any/every meal. I make the stew meat in the Crockpot and then my hubby adds some bbq sauce and them heats in a pan until the sugars caramelize. I love to just pop a few bites as a quick snack. 

You should check out r/Glp1meals for great ideas on easy to make foods, especially for days when you have a touchy tummy. 

Not everyone gets bad side effects. My hubby and son have had nothing but slight constipation that resolved on its own. I had severe constipation and began taking Metamucil twice a day without fail and haven't had any problems since. 

I wish you the best on your exciting new journey.

High protein food... chicken, beef, fresh veggies, eggs, cottage cheese... no heavy creamy sauces or heavier food.  Those can cause tummy issues if you're not careful.  Try to do low carb if possible. 

Protein, protein, protein!  It will help you lose less muscle.  In addition to high protein foods, I also recommend Fairlife Elite Core drinks, which have 42 grams of protein.  

And, perhaps one of the most important to have on hand: stool softeners, miralax, etc.  Your food will move slower through your system, so pooping will be less frequent, and you can get constipated very easily if you aren't careful.  Just watch it and have a plan in case it becomes an issue.  I would also recommend a product called Mag 07 that you can get off Amazon... it's the one thing that has NEVER failed me when I'm having constipation issues.  

Anti nausea meds, because you never know what your side effects will be when you start this.  I never had nausea, but I have a friend who takes a zofran with her shot because she's prone to having nausea when she takes the shot for some reason.

Mine are a little different as I have a personal aversion to anything that's too processed and just have never liked bars or shakes. My go tos are:

 \- nonfat greek yogurt (my 1200 calorie allotment is so low because I'm 5'1"" that I can't afford the extra cals in the fuller fat versions and I just get to eat more protein for the calorie allotment this way) and organic berries; frozen costco edamame (you can just pop them in the microwave for 2 mins); chicken breast to grill or roast to add to salads: whatever kind of organic greens you like, cherry tomatoes, some cheese, avocado, tablespoon of homemade lemon/olive oil vinaigrette; eggs; fish/steak/pork tenderloin/steak/chicken with huge portion of your favorite veggies for dinner (green beans, broccoli, asparagus, cauliflower, spinach, etc) and a very small 1/2 serving of carb: roast or baked potato, rice, a piece of bread etc. (I find that very small amounts of carb will help satisfy me, get me to up to my calorie requirement and actually help me lose more weight - I can't explain it). And a daily SALTT electrolyte packet and collagen powder in my coffee (I know I know, not exactly unprocessed but it's so helpful for my joints that I continue). 

This gives me around 100g of protein and has been working really well for me for my 13 weeks on sema, i'm down a little over 20lbs. No nausea, no constipation or other GI issues. Just drink a ton of water.

semaglutide,,1ogz56g,"2 Years on Ozempic — Strict, Disciplined, and Still Stuck at the Same Weight. Scared to Stop Because the Food Noise Comes Back.","Hey everyone,

I’ve been on Ozempic for almost 2 years, now on Wegovy 2.4 mg, and I’m honestly at a loss. I’ve been trying to lose weight for 3 years straight and despite doing everything right, the scale hasn’t really moved.

I also take Metformin 500 mg, blood pressure meds, cholesterol meds, and Vyvanse 10 mg.

About 3 weeks ago I started doing OMAD (One Meal A Day) and have stuck to it almost perfectly (just one 16:8 day). Before OMAD, I wasn’t a big eater either — I usually skipped breakfast and only ate lunch and dinner. I don’t drink any calorie beverages either, other than alcohol once a week.

Here’s what I’ve been doing consistently:
	•	High-protein, low-carb meals
	•	Calorie intake under 1,800/day
	•	Lifting 2–3x a week
	•	Walking/golf daily
	•	2–3L of water + electrolytes
	•	7+ hours of sleep with CPAP (sleep apnea managed)

Despite all that — I started at 273 lbs, dropped to 267 lbs the first week of OMAD, and now I’m right back at 273 lbs again.
It’s like my body just refuses to let go of weight no matter how much I dial in my diet or exercise.

The most frustrating part?
I actually feel healthier — my resting heart rate is down, energy is better, and I don’t feel sluggish anymore. But seeing zero movement on the scale after years of trying is disheartening.

And honestly, I’m terrified to stop Ozempic. The food noise — that constant mental chatter around food — was brutal before I started. It’s the one thing Ozempic completely silenced, and I’m scared it would all come back if I stopped.

Has anyone else hit this kind of long-term plateau where everything looks perfect on paper but your body just won’t budge?
What finally worked for you — if anything?
Did anyone switch medications or tweak something that finally moved the needle?

⸻

TL;DR:
2 years on Ozempic/Wegovy + Metformin, clean diet, fasting, workouts, no calorie drinks, and still the same weight. Feel better but can’t lose a pound. Scared to stop Ozempic because the food noise gets loud again.

If you are ""stuck"" at 273 lbs you HAVE to be eating enough calories daily to support that weight. Weight loss is just a calorie in - calorie out equation, there's no mystery involved.

If you say the ""food noise"" is quieted, that normally means that your hunger has reduced to the point you can sustainably eat at a substantial caloric deficit, well below the amount needed to sustain current weight, but you are apparently not doing so. Unless you have some very serious, chronic metabolic disease 1800 calories a day is not going to support 273 lbs of body weight, even if you spend all day in bed.",52.0

I say that because I was that and I remember saying the same kind of stuff you are saying in your post.   The key to loosing weight is honestly pretty simple and if you are not having food noise whatever that means (hunger, cravings) im guessing, then you should be a leg up already.  1. Start moving.. you need to work out.  Go on a walk... every day.... twice a day.... 3x a day... the more you do the easier it will be amd the more you enjoy it.  Make it a habit.  You have to burn calories and if your eating all those calories like you said then you need to burn....  2. Cut out soda... drink water and drink a lot.  This includes diet soda. Cut it all out and drink a ton of water..  this was hard for me because I did not like tge taste of water.  But now I love it...  looks months but I drink all day every day..... 3. You need to run a calorie deficit.... thats it.  If you dont snack, dont graze, etc which im guessing isnt an issue because of ozempic then you have a leg up.  Oh and 1 tip if you have a sweet tooth buy sugar free Popsicles at Walmart.  2.00 a box and taste pretty good and also helps get more water in you.  Im only sharing what worked for me.  I have walked over 200 miles since October 1st and I have extremely bad feet and hips from cancer but I love it so much and I got so tired of the weight I deal...

I’ve had multiple weeks where the scale wasn’t moving and I felt like no progress was being made. It can be hard to see progress when you’re tracking it daily, but pics and measurements really help. My goal weight is around 145, but I’ll stop sooner if my clothes fit before then",3.0
semaglutide,,1ohmk4u,Anyone Also Taking Mertazapine?,"Have been on Semaglutide since April and have been seeing steady, albeit slow, progress (down to 211 from 232) but about 3 weeks ago my Dr prescribed me Mertazapine as an off-label sleep aid bc the Lunesta I typically take had lost most of it’s effectiveness since I started Semaglutide. 

I’ve gained 8lbs in the 3 weeks since I started the Mertazapine with all other variables staying the same.  Mertazapine is known to cause fairly substantial weight gain from what I understand.  I’ve set an appt with my doctor for Friday to discuss it. 

I’m curious if anyone else has taken both Semaglutide and Mertazapine together, whether you gained weight, and how you navigated it (eg did you find an alternative to Mertazapine or did the weight gain effect subside after a certain point?).  Starting to feel like a fish swimming upstream.  

Appreciate any insight.

I track my weight weekly with a Garmin scale and app basically shows a slow, steady decline - and then a sharp increase that coincides with the Mirtazapine.  

I messaged my Sema doc about it but haven’t heard back yet.  Wasn’t all that worried about it at first but since it seems like there is some relevant interaction going on I guess I need to chase him again for a real discussion about it.  

The Mirtazapine has worked really well otherwise so I’d like to see if there’s a way to make it work and get the weight issue in check.

semaglutide,,1oh7cqs,A love letter to 0 25 Wegovy,"I am extremely proud of myself ! It definitely hasn't been easy, but I have so much more energy now . I'm more confident. I'm also only taking 1 blood pressure medication ! Where as before ( just 4 weeks and 1 day ago ! ) , when I was 271.9, I had to take 3 different blood pressure medications a day, and now I only take 1 Blood Pressure Medication a day ! Bonus, all my labs look great, and my A1.C is now looking beautiful! 

So, I want to be completely transparent and honest. I was/am/always have been a HUGE BINGER/BINGE EATER !
It was so bad on/to me in numerous ways, including but not limited to , mentally,  spiritually,  emotionally,  and financially. As in while eating 1 meal, I would already be eagerly anticipating my next meal and/or snack. 

Especially at night, after I put my youngin to bed. I would just eat and eat and eat . To the point that my stomach would be in so much pain , and most nights I would throw up ( Not on purpose, definitely not bulimia, instead i would throw up because I had over stuffed my stomach because I obviously ate way too much ) even still I would continue to eat. I wouldn't eat out for real , actual hunger , but because food helped me feel better and mask/hide my emotions from everything I had gone through.  

I've noticed that I'm much more patient, empathetic, and compassionate, and I also give myself more grace , not just with my toddler but also with complete strangers! I smile all the time, and folks reciprocate with smiles and small talk !

 Most importantly ( at least, to me ) is that I'm a much better and healthier mother to my very strong-willed ,very loved, very much always wanted, very active, 3 year old toddler, lol . Now, I can actively play with him ! Including chasing him, hide and seek, running up and down, and all over playgrounds with him, going all over the zoo, etc . All things I couldn't hardly be active for more than 10 minutes ! 

 Honestly, I think several different things/lifestyle changes/ daily exercise/meal planning , loghing , charting, and tracking everything in MyNetDiary APP.  As well as meal prep/plus my Miraculous , Glorious, Wegovy - I did 0.25 MG for 4 weeks , 

The last 7-10 days on the 0.25 mg were the absolute hardest because the ""food noise "" started to creep back in , which also coincided with my ovulation. 

I did have a follow up with my PCP Dr , She's amazing and we discussed any/all side effects and i let her know that,  while yes I lost weight,  my "" food noise "" was coming back with a vengeance.  So I agreed to go up to the next dose. Which is 0.50 1X a week . So far, it's been nothing short of a miracle gor me ! I have another follow-up with my PCP Dr on 12/22/2025. And I'm determined to lose another at least 25-40lbs a month before I see her 

All combined are the reason why I'm happier, healthier and why I have more patience now as a woman and a SMBC ( SOLO MOTHER BY CHOICE) who in just 4 weeks 1 day has lost a total of 31.3 lbs !!! 

Started- 

September 27th, 2026, 271.9 lbs

Now-

10/26/2025-  240.3 lbs !!! 

That's  a total of 31.3 lbs in 4 weeks, 1 day !

As a huge added bonus , I'm not in as much pain , so that makes me feel tremendously better (even though it's only 31.3 lbs so far ) versus before when I was even 271.9 ! 

 I take my 3 year old on 30-minute walks 2X a day. I also take him to the park and actively play with him the entire time . While as before, I could only play a few minutes at the park with him before I had to sit down and typically sat on my phone for the rest of the time we were at the park. 

Also , even though I've lost 31.3 lbs , I don't see much of a change physically.  I'm still wearing the same clothes from 31.3 lbs ago. But , i physically feel BETTER and have more energy and more stamina!
 
I'm kinder to myself and try to remind myself that I didn't gain all this weight instantly or overnight, but it took years to get to 271.9 lbs  . So , down to 240.3 in just 4 weeks and 1 day or 29 days total ! Is AMAZING to me because I honestly never thought I would get here ! 

 I try to always have an Attitude of Gratitude because, Just like my toddler isn't going to just magically be able to control their emotions/outbursts and tantrums immediately! It takes patience,  compassion, empathy/understanding, and the ability to recognize that, unfortunately, sometimes life just isn't fair.  

For Example- 
While Betty Jo down the street eats ginormous , ungodly amounts of food ( at least when you see her ), and yet she still weighs the same as she did in high school! Ugh , that can be so triggering and devastating!  I caution you from these thoughts,  because all you have to do is remind yourself,  YOU are NOT HER ! YOU have zero clue what goes on behind closed doors ! Maybe she's depressed.  Maybe she's in an extremely abusive relationship,  or 
Maybe she has a medical condition and wishes she could GAIN weight! Maybe she's on drugs and burns through all the extra calories and then some.  Maybe she's bulimic? Maybe she had/has plastic surgery? Or on the other hand. Maybe she only eats OMAD, so it's a huge portion with a full day of calories, and you just happen to see her then . Maybe she's also on a GLP-1S. Regardless of her reasons, Please try and remind yourself that HER Journey,  HER life , Her Decision, HER LIFESTYLE, and HER CHOICE(S) and everything she chooses to consume or do is NONE of your business.  IT has NOTHING to do with you! REMEMBER IT IS NEVER OKAY TO COMMENT ON ANOTHER WOMAN'S BODY ! UNLESS/UNTILL , YOU'VE WALKED A MILE IN HER SHOES, YOU NEED TO MIND YOUR OWN BISCUITS AND YOUR LIFE WILL BE GRAVY ! 

STOP COMPARING YOURSELF/LIFE/JOURNEY to others ! We are all beautifully, uniquely ourselves 💖

COMPARISON IS THIEF OF JOY 💖

So, instead of sitting/laying around bemoaning my wasted life , I'm now ACTIVELY Participating IN MY LIFE ! I am no longer just a spectator in mine and my 3 year olds' lives ! Instead, I'm now an active and willing participant in mine, and my toddlers lives 💙

I do track and log over EVERYTHING,  including water in the MyNetDiary APP. I use the free version.  It's awesome, and I can also enter food(s) , meals, and/or drinks before I eat/drink them . That way, I'm able to stick to less than 1200 calories a day, and I can add or remove BEFORE consuming so that I don't go over ! It also has a bar code scanner that you can use ( also free) to easily see all nutrient facts, including serving size, etc .

You can also add steps per day and exercise, sleep,  medications, etc ! All free , that's why I'm not going to bother to pay 9$ a month when the free version works just as well !

WE GOT THIS! WE ARE STRONG, BEAUTIFUL, BRAVE WEIGHT LOSS WARRIOR QUEENS 💖💋💕

semaglutide,,1ohhnsg,How much should I expect to lose in a year?,"My doctor gave me a 30 day supply of wegovy because I'm a 50 yr old male with a BMI over 40.  I was not fat my entire life and in fact ran 5 miles a day through my mid 30s but a back injury sent me into a deep spiral as I couldn't move like I used to.

I lost 17 lbs this first month and the doctor seemed pleased with it but my insurance will not cover wegovy and my doctor will not prescribe ozempic off-label as I do not have diabetes.

So, if I spend the $500 per month, is it realistic to expect to lose a hundred pounds within a year?  I have to seriously consider if it is worth that money as I have a family I support and that is a freaking car payment or two.

Thanks for any words of wisdom.

But the reason I am commenting is because I am concerned you haven’t been told these are life-long medications for the vast majority of people who qualify for them for weight management. Is that not a discussion you had with your doc?

If budget is a concern, consider looking to comp0ounded Semaglutide, which can be had from reputable telehealth providers. A few of them offer three months of any dose of sema for $399, which works out to $133/mo. 

ETA: CallOnDoc might be willing to write a script for off-label Ozempic. They write all brand name weight loss scripts and refills for free thanks to their compassionate care program. 

With the GoodRx coupon, you can get an Oz pen for $499 and count the clicks to take lower doses. I don’t think CallOnDoc will start you on the highest dose pen so you’ll have to work your way up each month until you can really benefit. https://www.callondoc.com/en/medications/ozempic",16.0

totally depends on your current weight/height and how much motivation you have to be actually dieting. if you are like 350+ lbs, totally possible. If you are 250 lbs are less, it's going to be hard.  
\>So, if I spend the $500 per month, is it realistic to expect to lose a hundred pounds within a year? I have to seriously consider if it is worth that money as I have a family I support and that is a freaking car payment or two  
Well for me the logic was that my family would prefer me not to die at 55-60 because of some obesity related conditions like most people do! I believe yours would have the same opinion. Also you will save A LOT by just easting less food every month if it's in USA. Actuall cost after saved food money would be $100-$200 per month which is ok for benefits.

I belive realistic weight loss speed long term is 1-1.5 lbs per week. Year has 52 weeks so it's about 50-75 lbs per year, which is a lot still.

I think taking this is the best thing I ever did, but it also (for me, and most people) does require additional work and effort. It is not a magic pill. Also, the same rules of weight loss apply: it will take time to lose the weight. 

I can afford the drug, but it is expensive. However, if I had continued on the path I was on, I would have wound up having to pay for health issues like diabetes, heart disease, etc, etc, which are also not cheap.

I am definitely eating WAY less than before see below for a typical day. My question is- why is the scale not moving? I mean I would be happy with even a pound. It’s just stuck? I’m moving around too- I was extremely sedentary before. I’m dancing and walking. Sweating. What am I doing wrong? 

Typical Day of eating:

Breakfast- egg whites, homemade sausage patty made with EXTRA LEAN beef, on whole wheat English muffin and a slice of cheese with fruit. 

Snack- low fat cheese stick or a fruit


Dinner - buffalo chicken bowl: 6 oz chicken breast, lettuce, 1/2 cup air fried potato mini cubes, some hot sauce, a slice of cheese, and Greek yogurt. 


I mean this CANT be high cal?  I’m literally tracking everything.  I’m eating Whole Foods, I am 28 years old, height- 5’2

health issues: I have hashismotos, hypothyroidism but it is under control with medication. 

HELP :( im getting discouraged.",0.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Semaglutide/comments/1ohhbvo/help_stuck_at_cw_sw_210_cw_201/,ResearchStill7932,2025-10-27 08:22:41,11.0,post,,,

Keep doing all the right things and the scale will move again. If you’ve gone four weeks with zero weight loss (and don’t have any adverse effects on the current dose), consider stepping up in dose.

semaglutide,,1ogzx1a,Newbie Stuff,,,,choctaw529,2025-10-26 20:58:23,,comment,nllgvx5,"Protein is important, but why? Protein sticks around longer, breaks down slower, keeps you full longer, and helps keep your blood sugar from taking big dips. You need to prioritize protein multiple times a day. If your nausea and fatigue are more pronounced in the morning, have a protein snack before bed. I drink Premier Protein ready to drink shakes. The Cafe Latte has the same amount of caffeine as 1 cup of coffee and 30 grams of protein. Some people drink protein rich coffee. I haven't tried it, but it sounds great. Others add unflavored collagen powder to their coffee to boost their protein intake.

Are you getting enough calories and are they balanced? I aim for 30% carbs or lower, 30% fat, and 40% protein. I'm not at goal every day, but I'm close. In the beginning, I struggled to eat more than 500-800 calories a day and suffered fatigue. I was having dental issues at the same time so it was hard to mostly drink my protein. I still struggle to get 1000 calories per day, but I try. 

Hydration is important, but don't overdue it. Too much water can be as much of a problem as too little. Anything over a gallon a day is too much, unless you're vomiting to excess or have extreme diarrhea. 

Electrolytes are important. Many people will tell you to get supplements and packets for your water to take 2-3 times a day. Again, too much is just as bad as too little. Too much and too little can cause nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, fatigue, heart palpitations, high blood pressure, muscle cramps, and headaches. If you can't get adequate electrolytes in your diet or you have excessive vomiting and/or diarrhea or you lose a lot of sweat from working outside or exercise, try an electrolyte beverage like Pedialyte or Powerade before jumping to supplements.

I offer this advice as a nurse and a user of semaglutide. I hope this helps and that your journey is a successful one.",6.0

\- Coffee thing is pretty common. Switch to herbal tea for like 2 months, you might be able to handle coffee again

In the beginning I was very hesitant to use scales and track the weight loss as I was worried it would become almost compulsive and that I may “punish” myself if I say gained a kilo since the last weigh in. I instead used going down sizes in clothing to track.

Now that I have a healthier relationship with food with help from wegovy I want to look at starting to track the weight loss.  Do you think it’s too late to start? If not what are the best apps?

It's the only measurement that I even loosely keep track of.  I couldn't tell you want the first waist measurement was, because I'm not recording it anywhere, I just know where I was last. As long as the waist measurement hasn't gone up, I'm good.


I didn't get an actual starting weight, because I didn't want to face it. Instead, I've been using the last number from the doctor's office before any intervention started. It is about six months outdated, and I was moving through a particularly bad period so I know I was probably a good 10-20 pounds heavier by the time I started doing anything about it, but since I don't know for sure I can't claim it. 


It's never too late to have a benchmark for your reference. It's nice for that to be an objective measurement (the fit of a single garment would work too), so that you aren't working with a moving target. Clothing is so variable that I worry you'd beat yourself up if you grab something that is marked as a 14 but fits like a 10 in other brands/cuts. ",2.0

Supplements,NAFLD,1m37s3w,Fructose Metabolism and the Energy Crisis of Modern Disease: A Research Journey,"## The Metabolic Theory of Everything?

This post is part personal reflection, part academic deep dive. I’ve spent the past several months exploring why so many chronic diseases—from obesity to Alzheimer’s—share similar metabolic features. The more I read, the more I kept coming back to one core dysfunction:

**Our cells can’t make or use energy properly.**

This isn’t just about fatigue. It shows up as insulin resistance, fat buildup in the wrong tissues, cognitive decline, and inflammation.  
Dr. Ben Bikman and others have argued that **insulin resistance** may be the central link across many of these conditions.

But that raised a new question for me:  
**What’s driving insulin resistance in the first place?**

That led me to a hypothesis I now find hard to ignore—one that may unify many threads in metabolic research:

**Fructose metabolism is acting like a biological “eco-mode,” throttling energy use and pushing us into storage mode—even when fuel is abundant.**

---

### A Pattern That Keeps Repeating

Across metabolic syndrome, diabetes, fatty liver, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and even cancer, we keep seeing the same signatures:

- Mitochondrial dysfunction  
- ATP depletion  
- Insulin resistance  
- Oxidative stress  
- Uric acid elevation  
- Fat accumulation in non-adipose tissue (liver, muscle, brain)

These aren’t isolated effects.  
They seem to reflect a coordinated biological state where energy production is suppressed, fat storage is favored, and normal metabolism is hijacked.

---

### Why Fructose?

Fructose is metabolized differently than glucose. It bypasses normal regulatory checkpoints and is rapidly taken up by the liver, where it activates the enzyme fructokinase (KHK-C). That does three things immediately:

- **Consumes ATP**, triggering a transient energy crisis  
- **Generates uric acid**, which suppresses mitochondrial function  
- **Signals starvation**, increasing hunger and reducing energy expenditure  

This would be helpful if you were about to hibernate or migrate—situations where storing energy and reducing output would extend survival.

But in a modern context—where fructose is everywhere and even made inside our bodies—this **adaptive “eco-mode” can get stuck on**, causing chronic dysfunction.

And crucially, **we don’t need to eat sugar to activate it**.  
Our bodies can synthesize fructose via the **polyol pathway**, especially under:

- High glycemic load (glucose spikes)  
- Alcohol consumption  
- Salt overload  
- Dehydration or low blood volume  
- Hypoxia or oxidative stress  

In short: whenever the body detects **environmental stress or resource scarcity**, it can shift into this state **endogenously**—as a survival adaptation.

---

### Different Diseases, Same Energy Crisis

The hypothesis is that many “different” diseases may simply reflect where this energy failure shows up first:

- In the **liver**: fatty liver and metabolic syndrome  
- In the **brain**: neurodegeneration and low dopamine  
- In **muscle**: insulin resistance and glucose intolerance  
- In **cancer**: metabolic rewiring toward glycolysis  
- In the **vasculature**: oxidative stress and hypertension  

It’s not about blaming fructose for everything. It’s about asking whether it’s *disproportionately responsible* for tipping mitochondria into dysfunction.

---

### A Paper That Brings It Together

The clearest articulation I’ve found of this hypothesis comes from Dr. Richard Johnson’s team, who’ve been pioneering this research for years. Their 2023 paper in *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B* is titled:

[*The Fructose Survival Hypothesis for Obesity*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2022.0230)

> *We propose excessive fructose metabolism not only explains obesity but the epidemics of diabetes, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity-associated cancers, vascular and Alzheimer's dementia, and even ageing.*  
>
> *Moreover, the hypothesis unites current hypotheses on obesity. Reducing activation and/or blocking this pathway and stimulating mitochondrial regeneration may benefit health-span.*

I’m not affiliated with their team—just a medical student drawn to how well their model connects survival biology with modern chronic disease. It’s also worth noting that the paper includes authors with pharmaceutical ties. That doesn’t prove the thesis, but it does signal serious research interest in targeting this pathway.

---

### A Unifying Theory for Obesity Models

One of the things I appreciate most is that this hypothesis **doesn’t contradict the caloric model**—it explains it.

Fructose metabolism increases hunger, suppresses satiety signals, and shifts the body into fuel conservation mode.  
Overeating and fat storage become *consequences*, not just causes.

It also ties together ideas from:

- The **insulin resistance model**  
- The **reward-based model** (via dopamine changes)  
- The **fat toxicity model** (due to fat being stored where it doesn’t belong)  
- And the **inflammation model** (via oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction)

All of these may be *downstream* of one adaptive but now maladaptive trigger: **fructose metabolism as a starvation response.**

---

### Where the Research Goes Next

While this paper focused on the adaptive biology and disease implications, a few interventions are already being explored:

- **Pfizer** tested a selective fructokinase inhibitor (PF-06835919) for NAFLD, which showed metabolic effects before being discontinued.  
- **Luteolin**, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has shown promise in blocking KHK-C in preclinical studies.  
  - In human trials (e.g. Altilix), it improved insulin resistance, liver enzymes, cholesterol, and visceral fat.  
  - It's also being explored in cancer, Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease, and even long COVID—suggesting a broad role in restoring mitochondrial health.  
- **Osthole** and **D-Mannose** are other early-stage natural candidates.

These aren’t mainstream interventions yet. But they hint at a future where **controlling fructose metabolism itself** becomes a viable tool—not just avoiding it.

That matters because even the cleanest diet can’t eliminate endogenous fructose.  
So the long-term goal may not be elimination, but intelligent control.

---

### Final Thought

I started this journey wanting to understand insulin resistance better. I didn’t expect to land here—but now it’s hard not to see fructose metabolism as the upstream switch that alters everything downstream.

Still learning. Still curious. Would love to hear if others are exploring this too, or any further evidence for or against to deepen the dive.

In fact honey even contains Luteolin.

The best explanation I've heard is when speaking of fruit.  In an unripe stage, the plants protects it's seeds with fibre and polyphenols that promote fat burning.  Then when it ripens these are progressively replaced with Fructose along with bright colors.  Which not only fits the thesis that this is a survival trick, but how fruit could be simultaneously healthy and potentially concerning.

What also works and what I take currently (too many antibiotics) is Tudca, HimalayaLiv52, plenty of super strong ginger tea. You need to drink a lot. 

Your tea is not strong enough and the powerful stuff is not water soluble. Go for Sylimarin from an online pharmacy.

Have you been tested for hepatitis? One reason for that liver problem is too many calories, especially sugars, e.g. from fruits and all the cheap stuff in cereals etc. Some light exercise and a diet will help as well. 

I had that strange feeling on my nipples recently too lol. but due to the antibiotics problem I took a lot, probably the maximum of Sylimarin a day and the liver got better. I am not allergic to something. I still take it.

The second time was after I had been diagnosed with vestibular migraines so all the things I put down to that.

Now I started two and a half weeks ago and I took a break for three days because I really couldn’t make out if it was the vestibular migraine or the milk thistle and started again and these symptoms started again

Supplements,NAFLD,1k0lcrr,Going to buy supplements for the first time & concerned about the brand-,"Hello, 
I am about to buy a few supplements, and I am concerned and overwhelmed about what to get. I am 43 years old, woman, and going through a serious medical issue for the first time in my life . Before this, well I have not had a cavity or a broken bone even, so I am really bad at knowing how to handle what is going on. 
I am really hoping that the supplements I am going to try and take will help my condition, but before I hit the checkout I just keep having these thoughts that I could buy this stuff and it could be completely junk , or even worse, if it isn't legitimate. 

I know about all these certifications to a point, but my issue is that I really don't trust what I read anymore from these companies or from the media especially, and it's hard for me to have confidence anymore in any type of product unless I hear from real everyday people . 
 
So , I am initially looking to buy NAC, Magnesium Glycinate, and a high quality Choline Lecithin that is not soy based if possible, and I've heard that egg derived choline is the best for the issue im trying to help, but I have not seen it yet 😭. I am also shopping around for a milk thistle or other type of supplement that actually is known to help the liver. My concerns about the milk thistle again are like, isn't it dried up and ineffective by the time we buy it?

Before I decided to just ask here, I did have this Codeage brand in my cart, and I had been about to purchase the NAC + PLATNIUM which says liposomal NAC +, which says :

 "" Premium NAC Formula: Codeage Liposomal NAC+ Platinum supplement features 900 mg of N-Acetyl L-Cysteine (NAC) in its free-form for a refined and pure ingredient profile.
Advanced Blend: This N Acetyl Cysteine supplement also includes Vitamin C, alpha-lipoic acid, and selenium (as L-selenomethionine).
Liposomal Delivery: This NAC vitamin supplement features the proprietary Codeage Helix liposomal delivery with a phospholipid complex utilizing non-GMO sunflower oil for added purity.
2-Month Suppy: Each bottle of Codeage N Acetylcysteine capsule supplement comes with 60 servings for 2 month supply. This NAC supplement is vegan, non-GMO, dairy-free, soy-free, and gluten-fre"" 

I also had their liposomal mag.glycinate , and was considering their ultra life telomers bc of the B12 and folate .... I've copied the details here: 
Coenzymated Vitamins:

"" Codeage Ultra Life Telomers offers two high-grade coenzymated vitamins 5-MTHF and Methyl B12 as well as 13 potent herbal extracts rooted in Ayurveda and TCM (Traditional Chinese Medicine) in an all-in-one supplement solution.
5-MTHF: Codeage Ultra Life Telomers offers 510 mcg DFE of Folate as L-Methylfolate 5 MTHF. 5-methyltetrahydrofolate is an active form of vitamin B9, present as folate and folic acid in specific foods and vegetables.
Vitamin B12: This dietary supplement also offers 250 mcg of vitamin B12 as methylcobalamin, an active form of vitamin B12 supplement.
Advanced Herbal Blend: Codeage Ultra Life Telomers also features a unique blend of herbs and nutrients, including astragalus, ashwagandha, holy basil, Fo-Ti extract, L-theanine, blueberry fruit powder, black pepper BioPerine, Rhodolia and Harikati extracts.
Manufactured in the USA: Codeage Ultra Life Telomers is non-GMO, dairy, soy, and gluten-free. This Life dietary supplement is manufactured in the USA in a cGMP-certified facility for quality and purity.""

For context, I found out that I have NAFLD this year, after I have been having liver pain, daily, for about 5 years. I do not have any cihrossis yet, but I need to do some about it now. They did a scan and asked me the deposits, and also a few tiny gallstones. 
Most importantly I am working on my weight- total I needed to lost 70 pounds. So far I have lost 30. Yesterday I bought a treadmill bc it's very bad where I live and I cannot walk outside safely. I love it I just tried it and this thing is going to help me a lot. I have been workong on completely changing my diet, i eat about 800-1k calories a day since the last few weeks and I am really scared that I won't be able to do anything about this, this pain is bad. 

Nothing helps it except when I changed my diet and actually, started having lecithin 😳. It is like a pain reliever for it. I am not diabetic, I was 2 points away though from being a prediabetic 😭😭😭😭😭. I'm wondering if maybe I should be pushing for metformin, but I really really wanna reverse this as much as I can , so if anyone has any advice for supplements, what to do, etc, I'm open to it. my amniotransferase levels are high too. 😢 ",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1k0lcrr/going_to_buy_supplements_for_the_first_time/,Sikorraa,2025-04-16 07:09:58,3.0,post,,,

Supplements,NAFLD,1fcyjra,Milk Thistle Experience,"I have had an extremely positive experience with milk thistle, and I am not exactly sure why.

I originally started on milk thistle about a month ago. I've had elevated liver enzymes in the last few blood tests, and a recent CAT scan showed that I had the beginnings of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), so I started it due to its literature evidence towards liver support.

Since taking it, here are the positive effects I've had:
(1) More positive mood and stability. Enjoy music more. More alert and self-assured.
(2) Significantly increased libido
(3) Decreased facial and stomach bloating
(4) Less acne
(5) Much less back pain and irritability.

I am not sure why it has such a positive effect,  especially with libido. The effect has persisted in the past month, and I haven't changed much in my stack since then. I generally eat healthy and don't have added sugar or many carbohydrates, but that diet was stable before starting thistle and seeing those effects.

Supplements,NAFLD,133kuzy,What supplements do you think should be baseline for everyone?,"IF they want to PRESERVE & / OR GET BACK to better health, even if their lifestyle isn't that unhealthy anyway?

Right now, I supplement Vitamin D3 - because after a test I found out I was around 18ng/L, which I think is quite low. Then I take TUDCA & NAC every morning because I have NAFLD. And a B-Complex since I think the benefit outweighs the risk (if any).

Since taking NAC, I have found out it can deplete copper. So I was thinking about picking some up. Also, I can't remember which, but I heard one of the supplements I am taking can lower magnesium. I also heard it is best to take VITAMIN-A with D3, and NAC is better absorbed with Glycine - and Vitamin C enhances the absorption of the B-Vitamins, and so on.. --- None of which I am taking. At this point would it not just be easier to buy a multivitamin? But then which do you choose, since a lot of them are really questionable in quality and dose certain nutrients too high sometimes?

- Omega 3 Fish Oil: 1-4g daily. Look for an IFOS certified product (google it), or Nordic Naturals.

Beyond that, you’re really fine-tuning the margins. I take a whole bunch of vitamins and supplements, but if I had to pare that down to the “Essentials,” I’d keep D, MG, and Zinc.

Herbs and herbal preparations are different, and incorporating healthy herbs is good, but with caution and knowledge. What most people do not consider is that even things like Omega 3, K2 etc have molecular analogues that are present in natural food and not in the isolated supplements, and you do not get those through supplements.

I kept doing this (gaining a skill set) every time med. treatments failed and were unsatisfactory.

I'm dealing with a lot of personal/life issues and my supplement protocol is a reflection of it. But it's getting embarrassing at this point and I am sure I am over-doing it. 

Basic run-down: basically healthy, but feeling very deficient due to a horrible divorce, highly stressed and dysregulated nervous system, perimenopausal (age 48), sleep issues, depression and anxiety, and too much alcohol (which I am cutting back on as much as possible, but right now it's the only thing that helps me feel any sense of calm), two teenage sons (who are lovely and fabulous, but deserve a mom that isn't hurting so much). 

So, I find myself thinking that I am a prime candidate for many, many supplements. Many... 

Tell me which ones I can cut out and if there are multiple vitamins I should consider to cover the bases:

I'm considering:

AM: 

1. \-Fatty 15 (omega 3)
2. \-Pro-biotic 
3. D3 + K
4. L-Tyrosine
5. TUDKA (liver support)
6. \-TMG (because I am taking NAD+ sub-q)
7. Glucosamine MSM 

Lunch: 

1. Live green powder (multivitamins, pre-biotics, minerals)
2. Protein powder
3. Collagen powder 
4. Colostrum 
5. Fiber powder
6. Glycine (aminos)
7. Iodine (couple of drops - low salt intake)
8. Berberine
9. EGCG
10. CLA
11. MTC oil
12. L-Carnatine
13. Creatine
14. Astaxanthin

Dinner (with food):

1. Liver supplement (Milk Thistle...)
2. Magnesium Glycinate
3. Digestive enzyme
4. 5-HTP
5. Turmeric
6. MTC-1
7. Beef intestines (tribal queen)
8. Glutathione

 Bedtime: 

1. L-thionine
2. Magnesium Glycinate
3. GABA
4. SAM-E (if fasted)
5. L-Tryptophan
6. NAC
7. L-Tyrosine

 I am even considering adding HMB as a help to recover from workouts because I am soooooo sore!  


Please nicely tell me why I am crazy and how I can be less so.

I need help trimming down my crazy...,,,,Outrageous_Truths,2025-10-12 16:10:09,,comment,nj6mzlq,"Listen…please - I’m going to be straight with you. Im not in the medical field, but if I had to guess - you most likely have anxiety, depression, and are overly obsessive with the supplements you’re taking. Any positive benefits you “think” you are feeling are mostly placebo. Why do I say that? Because I was doing the exact same thing during a very stressful life period…one in which I I physically felt horrible and started believing that the missing pieces to “feeling good” were supplements…and the list of pills and shakes and drops to take daily grew and grew and grew.  Every time I read some article or research, I added it. Not only did it become ridiculously expensive - I was chasing something that supplements would NEVER be able to help and was exhausting my liver/kidneys at the same time. What did I do? I stopped taking any supplements - took none of them for 60 days. Yep - cold turkey, just stopped. During those 60 days, I focused on walking everyday outside (getting sunlight/movement), hydrating, meditating 15 minutes per day, stretching, tucking in same time each night and walking up same time in the morning, eating three times daily and frankly - seeing a therapist to talk through my personal life. After 60 days, albeit expensive, I got bloodwork done to identify any vitamin or mineral deficiencies, as well as thyroid, liver, lipid, and inflammation issues. What do you know? I was slightly low in Vitamin D and Iodine and had slightly high cholesterol and that was it - so I started low dose supplements to address those minor items. Vitamin D (with K), Kelp for the iodine, and Omega-3s with a better diet for the cholesterol. And that’s it…THATS IT…I feel better than I have in years and I guarantee you the three supplements I now take have almost nothing to do with it. Supplements can never replace self-care and mental wellness which is exponentially more life changing than any pill. Best wishes and I hope your life improves!",79.0

They both have connections to production of adrenaline and similar.   Some people like tyrosine in the AM to help them get started. 

the other things you take at bedtime make sense although it seems strange you don't take melatonin.  I understand tryptophan and B6 are needed upstream to make melatonin. 

Glutathione probably not needed.  You support your body's natural production of it. 

I take glucosamine in the evening.  The body does many of its repair processes overnight.

You are taking collagen and protein powder.

If I was your medical provider I would have you stop everything and monitor you for serotonin crash. 


I'd focus exclusively on adding back only the things to support sleep and serotonin, and get you stable on that. 


THEN, I would begin you on hormone replacement as needed to get you feeling optimal. 


No, it doesn't not cause cancer and that fact is all over the news trying to reeducate the population away from this medical lie. 


Women have a significant mental and stress tolerance drop at your age because of how estrogen drop effects the brain. HRT fixes these issues as well as anxiety. 


If and only if your stress doesn't come down with HRT, then I would start reaching for the mental support supplements you are taking.


After ALL that, and we have that in lock down, then you would have a green light to add supplements back. But you have to get stable first.

First and foremost, I would recommend Shoden Ashwagandha, It's possibly the most powerful supplement on the planet for cutting cortisol. It doubles KSM-66 effect at reducing cortisol by 60% compared to ksm’s 30%. On top of that, it has some of the best sleep metrics out of even dedicated sleep supplements. On top of that, I would recommend magnesium glycinate or 5 grams of glycine for sleep support. And if you are really feeling that you need a mental pick-me-up, I would add Affron patented Saffron, since it has some of the best data in regards to depression and mood and is comparable to lose dose SSRI’s without the side effects. Then, for the alcohol, I would focus on 1,200 mg of NAC if you think your liver is really in a tough spot. However, 600 mg NAC every day with an empty stomach should probably be enough. Besides this, you need a dedicated methylated multivitamin with chelated minerals. This is just fancy for saying these vitamins and minerals are actually active in the body. Otherwise, you could get inactive forms and possibly waste money. I recommend Morpho Multi  if you want everything covered for a high price, otherwise I personally get Nutricost Methyl multi Which gets 80% of the job done at only $7 per month. From here, your bases are covered in regards to stress, mood, micronutrients, and then you can start adding stuff back in like creatine, berberine, omega-3s, curcumin, of which I personally recommend theracurmin it has positive data for alzheimers and really strong data for cognition and neuroprotection.

Most of us go through that phase of adding more supplements to fix different issues, but it can backfire when things overlap or compete with each other.

If it helps, start by getting blood work done and keeping only what your results or doctor confirm you need. From there, focus on basics that cover most gaps, like magnesium, omega 3s, and a good multivitamin.

Sometimes I (half-jokingly) call them my ""emotional support supplements"" ;)

You've got some good things in here. I'm mainly questioning the timing. And I definitely think you could streamline a bit.

L-tyrosine: take only in the morning, not at night, as it can be stimulating/energizing

D3+K: take with a fat-containing meal

Glycine: take at bedtime

Creatine: take directly before and/or after a workout (should help with soreness)

Magnesium glycinate: you only need to take this once, before bed

5-HTP: take this before bed but it's essentially redundant with L-Tryptophan, so take one or the other. Consider adding Taurine (500mg)

NAC: better to take in the morning

EGCG + Turmeric: these have both been shown to cause liver damage if taken at too high a dose / for too long. I'd drop these.

MTC-1: this is the only one I didn't recognize

Hate to recommend one you might ADD, but I'd suggest a good quality methylated multi B-vitamin.

You could try a bit of an 'elimination diet' and drop things out for a few weeks, see if you notice a difference, and add back in accordingly. It's also good to rotate supplements so you don't overdo it.",9.0

Supplements,fatty liver,1nvp73n,Is there a take-before-meal supplement that will help someone digest fatty meal?,"My mother has always gotten very nauseous after eating anything fatty, like full-fat ice cream, fish and chips, etc.  She has always just avoided fatty foods but sometimes her ladies group likes to dine at places that only have fried foods; this past weekend it was a pub and she ate the chips, but didn't feel great afterwards. She's elderly and needs to be able to go out with her friends, especially since her husband died, so I'd really like to find something she could take before a fatty meal so she can eat with the rest of them, something like how you can take Beano before raw vegetables, but for oily/high-fat foods.

I am trying to find out from her *how* she gets sick after high-fat foods. Does she get nauseous? Acid stomach with heartburn? She's never been specific, but I'll try to get her to be.

I know it's hard to know which enzyme is needed without knowing why she feels sick after a high-fat food; it could be gallbladder, pancreas, liver...she could need bile salts, lipase, but I thought there might be a digestive enzyme supplement she could take **right before a meal** that would cover all the bases. It might not be an enzyme deficiency, but I thought a supplement was worth a try.

We are in Ontario, Canada, so need a recommendation for supplements we can get here.

Thanks.

Edit: she had a full hysterectomy nearly 30 years ago, so it's not her ovaries.

Supplements,fatty liver,1nre3vz,Every chronic disease shows the same fingerprint: low energy. Have we finally found the upstream trigger?,"Across conditions that look unrelated — obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, hypertension, dementia — the same fingerprint keeps appearing: **mitochondrial dysfunction, low cellular energy.**

Recent research makes the point clear:  
- [Reversing cognitive decline by powering up mitochondria (Nature Neuroscience, 2025)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-025-02032-y)  
- [COVID-19 as a mitochondriopathy driving systemic dysfunction (ScienceDirect, 2025)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213231725002794)  

The pattern seems hard to ignore: fragile energy is the common denominator.

That makes me wonder if we’ve been asking the wrong questions. Instead of focusing on which diet or supplement might help, shouldn’t we be asking what **drives cells into low-energy states in the first place?**

A credible upstream switch should meet six criteria:

- **Reproducible mechanism** — directly lowers ATP and impairs mitochondria.  
- **Ubiquitous exposure** — not a rare toxin, but nearly universal today.  
- **Redundant triggers** — stays active even if one input is removed.  
- **Historical alignment** — rises in lockstep with chronic disease curves.  
- **Actionable/testable** — modulating it improves multiple endpoints.  
- **Unifies incomplete models** — explains why calorie, hormonal, and inflammation theories each hold part of the truth but don’t explain the epidemic alone.  

A few ideas hit some of these. But one pathway checks all six: **fructose metabolism.**

- **Mechanism:** Unlike glucose, fructose bypasses checkpoints, rapidly depleting ATP (via KHK), generating uric acid, and downshifting mitochondria.  
- **Ubiquity:** Fructose exposure is unavoidable in modern life. It’s not just sugar and HFCS. Whole fruit adds seasonal doses (though fruit is often protective thanks to fibre, potassium, and polyphenols) — but here’s the bigger reveal: **common foods like refined carbs, alcohol, and salty processed snacks all trigger endogenous fructose synthesis**. This explains why debates about “carbs vs. alcohol vs. salt” have each seemed partly right — they’re all hitting the same switch through different doors.  
- **Redundancy:** Even if diet is cleaned up, the pathway doesn’t fully turn off. Dehydration, hypoxia (like in sleep apnea), stress hormones, and obesity itself (via osmolality and oxygen shortage) all trigger endogenous fructose. This redundancy shows its original purpose: a survival mechanism designed to conserve energy and water under multiple stresses.  
- **History:** For millennia fructose was scarce and seasonal. Industrial sugar, HFCS, and processed foods made it constant — and the disease curves climbed in parallel.  
- **Actionable:** Essential fructosuria proves the pathway is optional. KHK inhibitors and natural modulators like luteolin improve liver fat, insulin sensitivity, and blood pressure.  
- **Unifying lens:** Calories matter — but fructose drives the cravings and fat-trapping that make excess unavoidable. Hormones matter — but insulin and leptin resistance are downstream of energy depletion. Inflammation matters — but uric acid and oxidative stress trace back to the same source. **Hyperinsulinemia could almost fit the criteria, but fructose sits further upstream, explaining why it develops in the first place.**  

Put together, the model is almost absurdly simple: **fructose reduces metabolism → fragile cells → fragile organs → fragile systems.** What we call “different diseases” may just be different faces of the same low-energy biology.

In response to the rigorous underlying science, one review concludes: *“Excessive fructose metabolism not only explains obesity but the epidemics of diabetes, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity-associated cancers, vascular and Alzheimer’s dementia, and even ageing. Moreover, the hypothesis unites current hypotheses on obesity.”*  
https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2022.0230  

This demands rigorous debate and experimentation.  
> **Is chronic disease basically a survival switch stuck ‘on’ — with fructose metabolism as the upstream engine keeping cells in low-energy mode?**  
If not, what alternative mechanism fits all six criteria more cleanly?  

For anyone interested in the full model, here’s a [**whitepaper series**](https://liv3health.com/blogs/white-paper/metabolic-energy-failure-framework) and a recent [**Boost Your Biology podcast episode**](https://open.spotify.com/episode/7honYUtWK641ybrkuTwUjs?si=218fd5a4df7e45f2) that explore it further.

> ***Which single biochemical pathway unites obesity, diabetes, fatty liver, hypertension, kidney disease, dementia, and cancer by producing the same early fingerprint of cellular energy failure — ATP depletion, mitochondrial suppression, uric acid generation, and cravings — and, being triggered both by diet and endogenous stressors, makes the strongest candidate as the causal driver of the metabolic epidemic?  If true, what strategies, molecules or nutrients may directly modulate the stressor?***

Edit: Apologies - quite a few of my replies are stuck in Automod purgatory.  Hopefully they'll be unlocked.

---

**TL;DR**  
- The four pillars of chronic disease — metabolic, cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, and cancer — share the same fingerprint: **low cellular energy**, progressing from fragile cells → fragile systems.  
- While many stressors can cause this, **fructose metabolism is unique**: universal, redundant (dietary + endogenous), constant, and often stacked with other stresses.  
- This makes fructose metabolism the **most likely root cause of modern metabolic dysfunction**, unifying other disease models.  
- **Lifestyle fixes have been tried for years**; they unknowingly help by reducing fructose load (including endogenous production) or by supporting energy recovery — but they are highly restrictive and fail at scale, especially given the pathway’s redundancy.  
- The pathway is **validated**: enzyme assays, animal models, human RCTs — reinforced by evidence from **nature, history, and economics**.  
- **Luteolin**, a natural polyphenol, shows near-complete validation as a safe way to modulate fructose metabolism, paralleling the benign phenotype of essential fructosuria.  
- Existing strategies focus on energy recovery. **Modulating fructose metabolism targets the hole in the bucket.**  ",304.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/1nre3vz/every_chronic_disease_shows_the_same_fingerprint/,ATPDropout,2025-09-26 14:53:01,194.0,post,,,

""While it is commonly believed that the liver is the main site of fructose metabolism, Jang et al. show that it is actually the small intestine that clears most dietary fructose, and this is enhanced by feeding. High fructose doses spill over to the liver and to the colonic microbiota.""

Jang, C. et al. The Small Intestine Converts Dietary Fructose into glucose and organic acids. Cell Metabolism, 2018:
https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(17)30729-5

***

""High-dose fructose is different because it can overwhelm the small intestine’s ability to convert fructose to glucose. That results in fructose reaching the liver and microbiome and inducing intestinal permeability, oxidative stress, inflammation, and fatty liver—all leading, in turn, to an increased risk of insulin resistance.

According to Princeton researcher Joshua D. Rabinowitz:

“There is a fundamental physiological difference in how smaller and larger amounts of sugar are processed in the body.”

“Fructose from moderate amounts of fruits will not reach the liver. However, the small intestine probably starts to get overwhelmed with sugar halfway through a can of soda or large glass of orange juice.”

Have we finally found the upstream trigger?,,,,SuperFunTime777,2025-09-27 14:16:50,,comment,ngjnoxl,"Interesting post — the KHK/fructose angle is legit enough that pharma’s been chasing inhibitors for fatty liver and metabolic disease for a while. The “fructose → ATP depletion → uric acid → mitochondrial stress” loop is a real mechanism and worth watching.

Where it goes sideways is the “and therefore luteolin is the secret master fix.” In vitro, luteolin does inhibit fructokinase, but translating that into humans is another story — absorption is poor, dosing unclear, and there’s basically no large-scale clinical evidence that popping luteolin pills shuts down fructose metabolism in a meaningful way.

The “liposomal luteolin / special supplement formulations” part starts to smell more like nutraceutical marketing than settled science. If KHK turns out to be a strong therapeutic target, pharma’s designed inhibitors will likely beat a flavonoid extract on potency and reproducibility.

So yeah: the upstream fructose hypothesis is a cool and testable unifying idea. But leaping from that into “buy this obscure supplement” feels like sliding from research to sales pitch. Until human trials show luteolin works in practice, this is still theory, not therapy.",9.0

Supplements,fatty liver,1nre3vz,Every chronic disease shows the same fingerprint: low energy. Have we finally found the upstream trigger?,,,,Smooth_Imagination,2025-09-27 03:31:54,,comment,nggi8hm,"Diabetes is a component, but more critical is general accumulation of 'junk' especially reactive nitrogen species, ALEs and reactive aldehydes as well as AGEs. Endoplasmic reticulum stress and overloading the cell and its self cleaning pathways happens upstream of diabetes and high blood sugar.


This dysfunction leads ultimately to dysfunctiomal mitophagy and reduced mitobiogenesis. 


That in turn amplifies the problem in a feedback via mitochondria that both pumps out more free radicals and produces less ATP. The mitochondria also play a key role in removing the junk, such as the respiration poisons like reactive aldehydes. Thus you create more radicals, more poisons snd less energy in a continual pro-aging feedback. Diabetes and prediabetes /metabolic syndrome is just one aspect of these amplifying feedbacks acting mainly on one source of radicals. 


The early antiaging research was on r lipoic acid and acetyl l carnitine. The Al Car increased the deliveey of toxic mitochondia poisoning junk to oxidatibe pathways in the mitochondria, whilst the lipoic acid protected the mitochondria from the compounds and metabolite radicals. 


Mitochondria are highly dependent on cellular function and recent research shows that damage to telomeres impscts mitochondria and repairing or targetting either has the same effect - much of the harm caused by processes that damage telomeres and the telomere danafe itself feedback and manifest via damage to mitochondria. 


R lipoic acid appears in high doses to block mitophagy. But Al Car and Ubiquinone / Ubiquinol works similarly, and ubiquinol is not thought to impair mitophagy. Agents like lithium likely enhance mitophagy and mitochondrial biogenesis, especially in the brain, since low dose lithium caused cortical thickening and mitochondrial expansion would account for dendritic and cell volume growth large enough for the observed brain growth.",6.0

For nonalcoholic fatty liver, milk thistle’s silymarin may support liver health, but benefits depend on consistent use and the right dose. Try taking it with food to reduce nausea, and consider lowering the dose to 100 mg daily, gradually increasing as tolerated. Pause for a few days, then reintroduce slowly to assess if nausea persists. If it does, you might need a different formulation or brand. I recommend Pure Encapsulations or Thorne, both third-party tested for purity. Look for standardized silymarin content (70-80%). Typical doses range from 140-420 mg daily, split into 2-3 doses. Rarely, allergies or digestive sensitivities can cause reactions, so monitor symptoms. Other liver-support options like dandelion root or NAC might be worth discussing with your doctor, who you’re smart to consult. Everyone’s body reacts differently, so tracking symptoms and adjusting cautiously is key.",2.0

Supplements,fatty liver,1n0wzg8,Trying to build a supplement routine but feel overwhelmed,"
Hi, wonder if anyone could help me improve my supplement routine. I’ve been reading so much online my head is spinning and the GP is not helpful. 
I am 41yo f with non alcoholic mild fatty liver, mild pcos, insulin resistance. Awful brain fog and fatigue, energy so low I only have about 3-4hrs of productivity, at times cannot form sentences, words just wouldn’t leave my mouth or I say the wrong thing, memory is quite patchy and unreliable, wake up groggy and tired. Gone up one size in the last few years and cannot lose it. Been practicing intermittent fasting for a month now to see if that changes anything. Mostly vegetarian diet, I eat well - plenty of veggies, pulses, fermented foods and yogurt. Physical activity - 10k steps almost every day, 45 min of core exercises once a week, and hour of yoga once a week - physically and mentally cannot do any more. 

From what I understand my folate (10.7 ug/l) ferritin (57 ug/l) and b12 (273 ug/l) levels are suboptimal.

My routine now is as follows:
Ashwagandha and 600 mg NAC in the morning (+2 small cups of black coffee)
1000 mg Myo Inositol and 22 mg Chelated Zinc in the afternoon 
200 mg Ferrous sulfate with 500 mg vitamin C before bed

I am looking to add a multivitamin complex, B12 and Omega 3, perhaps magnesium glycinate. Have really high hopes for B12 but unclear if it needs to be taken with folate? I currently do not want to include vit D as a few months ago my levels appeared to be too high (129 nmol/l).

Any insights or pointers to older post addressing similar issues hugely appreciated!

Leave out Zinc, vitamin C, B12, complex etc. if you have a normal diet.

Leave aside Ashwaganda for now, up your NAC dose to 1000 mg (or 1200 mg if you decide 2 of the same pills).

Include creatine 15mg for long-term cognitive benefits, will go well with the NAC too.

If your vitamin D3 level is too high by default, then you NEED to include more magnesium for proper synthesis and potentially bring it down to normal levels. Could indicate severe magnesium deficiency.

Supplements,fatty liver,1m37s3w,Fructose Metabolism and the Energy Crisis of Modern Disease: A Research Journey,"## The Metabolic Theory of Everything?

This post is part personal reflection, part academic deep dive. I’ve spent the past several months exploring why so many chronic diseases—from obesity to Alzheimer’s—share similar metabolic features. The more I read, the more I kept coming back to one core dysfunction:

**Our cells can’t make or use energy properly.**

This isn’t just about fatigue. It shows up as insulin resistance, fat buildup in the wrong tissues, cognitive decline, and inflammation.  
Dr. Ben Bikman and others have argued that **insulin resistance** may be the central link across many of these conditions.

But that raised a new question for me:  
**What’s driving insulin resistance in the first place?**

That led me to a hypothesis I now find hard to ignore—one that may unify many threads in metabolic research:

**Fructose metabolism is acting like a biological “eco-mode,” throttling energy use and pushing us into storage mode—even when fuel is abundant.**

---

### A Pattern That Keeps Repeating

Across metabolic syndrome, diabetes, fatty liver, cardiovascular disease, dementia, and even cancer, we keep seeing the same signatures:

- Mitochondrial dysfunction  
- ATP depletion  
- Insulin resistance  
- Oxidative stress  
- Uric acid elevation  
- Fat accumulation in non-adipose tissue (liver, muscle, brain)

These aren’t isolated effects.  
They seem to reflect a coordinated biological state where energy production is suppressed, fat storage is favored, and normal metabolism is hijacked.

---

### Why Fructose?

Fructose is metabolized differently than glucose. It bypasses normal regulatory checkpoints and is rapidly taken up by the liver, where it activates the enzyme fructokinase (KHK-C). That does three things immediately:

- **Consumes ATP**, triggering a transient energy crisis  
- **Generates uric acid**, which suppresses mitochondrial function  
- **Signals starvation**, increasing hunger and reducing energy expenditure  

This would be helpful if you were about to hibernate or migrate—situations where storing energy and reducing output would extend survival.

But in a modern context—where fructose is everywhere and even made inside our bodies—this **adaptive “eco-mode” can get stuck on**, causing chronic dysfunction.

And crucially, **we don’t need to eat sugar to activate it**.  
Our bodies can synthesize fructose via the **polyol pathway**, especially under:

- High glycemic load (glucose spikes)  
- Alcohol consumption  
- Salt overload  
- Dehydration or low blood volume  
- Hypoxia or oxidative stress  

In short: whenever the body detects **environmental stress or resource scarcity**, it can shift into this state **endogenously**—as a survival adaptation.

---

### Different Diseases, Same Energy Crisis

The hypothesis is that many “different” diseases may simply reflect where this energy failure shows up first:

- In the **liver**: fatty liver and metabolic syndrome  
- In the **brain**: neurodegeneration and low dopamine  
- In **muscle**: insulin resistance and glucose intolerance  
- In **cancer**: metabolic rewiring toward glycolysis  
- In the **vasculature**: oxidative stress and hypertension  

It’s not about blaming fructose for everything. It’s about asking whether it’s *disproportionately responsible* for tipping mitochondria into dysfunction.

---

### A Paper That Brings It Together

The clearest articulation I’ve found of this hypothesis comes from Dr. Richard Johnson’s team, who’ve been pioneering this research for years. Their 2023 paper in *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B* is titled:

[*The Fructose Survival Hypothesis for Obesity*](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rstb.2022.0230)

> *We propose excessive fructose metabolism not only explains obesity but the epidemics of diabetes, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obesity-associated cancers, vascular and Alzheimer's dementia, and even ageing.*  
>
> *Moreover, the hypothesis unites current hypotheses on obesity. Reducing activation and/or blocking this pathway and stimulating mitochondrial regeneration may benefit health-span.*

I’m not affiliated with their team—just a medical student drawn to how well their model connects survival biology with modern chronic disease. It’s also worth noting that the paper includes authors with pharmaceutical ties. That doesn’t prove the thesis, but it does signal serious research interest in targeting this pathway.

---

### A Unifying Theory for Obesity Models

One of the things I appreciate most is that this hypothesis **doesn’t contradict the caloric model**—it explains it.

Fructose metabolism increases hunger, suppresses satiety signals, and shifts the body into fuel conservation mode.  
Overeating and fat storage become *consequences*, not just causes.

It also ties together ideas from:

- The **insulin resistance model**  
- The **reward-based model** (via dopamine changes)  
- The **fat toxicity model** (due to fat being stored where it doesn’t belong)  
- And the **inflammation model** (via oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction)

All of these may be *downstream* of one adaptive but now maladaptive trigger: **fructose metabolism as a starvation response.**

---

### Where the Research Goes Next

While this paper focused on the adaptive biology and disease implications, a few interventions are already being explored:

- **Pfizer** tested a selective fructokinase inhibitor (PF-06835919) for NAFLD, which showed metabolic effects before being discontinued.  
- **Luteolin**, a naturally occurring flavonoid, has shown promise in blocking KHK-C in preclinical studies.  
  - In human trials (e.g. Altilix), it improved insulin resistance, liver enzymes, cholesterol, and visceral fat.  
  - It's also being explored in cancer, Alzheimer’s, cardiovascular disease, and even long COVID—suggesting a broad role in restoring mitochondrial health.  
- **Osthole** and **D-Mannose** are other early-stage natural candidates.

These aren’t mainstream interventions yet. But they hint at a future where **controlling fructose metabolism itself** becomes a viable tool—not just avoiding it.

That matters because even the cleanest diet can’t eliminate endogenous fructose.  
So the long-term goal may not be elimination, but intelligent control.

---

### Final Thought

I started this journey wanting to understand insulin resistance better. I didn’t expect to land here—but now it’s hard not to see fructose metabolism as the upstream switch that alters everything downstream.

Still learning. Still curious. Would love to hear if others are exploring this too, or any further evidence for or against to deepen the dive.

In fact honey even contains Luteolin.

The best explanation I've heard is when speaking of fruit.  In an unripe stage, the plants protects it's seeds with fibre and polyphenols that promote fat burning.  Then when it ripens these are progressively replaced with Fructose along with bright colors.  Which not only fits the thesis that this is a survival trick, but how fruit could be simultaneously healthy and potentially concerning.

Supplements,fatty liver,1luwsxr,Withdrawals.,,,,Airfrying_witch,2025-07-09 17:32:05,,comment,n2a1h1t,"Got it. Not sure if that alcohol intake is at a level that could cause the same risk as an every day drinker, but highly encourage you to research signs of alcohol withdrawal which are life threatening so you’re aware. Wish I had more info about helpful supplements, but I think I’ve seen threads on quitting alcohol/substances that may be more tailored to the advice you’re looking for. 

Sometimes EFT tapping and EMDR resourcing can help with panic attacks if you’re still experiencing them. EFT tapping videos on YouTube are plentiful and vary in focus (ie calm/peace/joy/releasing worry etc). I especially found the EMDR resourcing helpful for myself and clients. 

First component includes bilateral stimulation, which is simply doing a movement on the left side of your body and then the same on the right, then rinse and repeat. When I’m low energy I’ll lay in bed on my back, knees propped up, and then swing/tip them left and right. If I don’t want to move at all I’ll look at the corner of the walls and ceiling on the left side of my room and then right. But also this could just be going for a walk, sitting and swaying left and right, whatever feels best in your body. 

An additional / optional option is to recall a pleasant memory / visualize something that evokes whatever emotion you’d like to feel. Combining this with the movement strengthens this resource in your brain, and the idea is that you’ll be able return to this whenever you’re experiencing a panic attack/ low mood to decrease their intensity. The more you practice outside of those moments, the easier it gets to return to them in the moment they return. 

One more additional / optional practice to include is to add a statement / mantra that focuses on how you would like to feel. Utilize your spiritual practice if there is one you find supportive. I lean spiritual due to trauma around religion, so I like to include gratitude and the universe as a higher power. If your atheist, speaking to your highe(r/st) self is an option.  Examples might be

Thank you universe for making it easy for me to:
Stay emotionally regulated
Feel joy
Feel peace
Feel connection
Take care of myself
Maintain sobriety
Sleep well and feel rested
Listen to and follow my intuition
Know what I need & want

Just tailor to what you need. Including mindfulness through senses can help as well. Incorporating things in every day life that are pleasant to the senses can turn down the volume of the unpleasant things. Know that whatever you focus on, your brain will find more of that to focus on. Guess I rambled here a bit, hope something is helpful to you ❤️",1.0

Supplements,fatty liver,1l5geju,Rate my stack and suggest any improvements,"Hi, I'm very new to this process of taking supplements, this is the first time I went overboard to take in charge of my health and become active, healthy and a fit individual. To begin with, I am obese, I have gained 25+ kgs weight in the last 2 years due to job stress, poor lifestyle and bad eating habits. Lately I'm realising how difficult it is to reverse all symptoms I'm feeling and want to become fit again. Suffering with lethargy, low energy, inconsistency, brain fog and mild ADHD. I have stage 1 fatty liver as a result of overweight, on the verge of prediabetic, doctor has adviced me to reduce weight to back to normal, it's all about weight loss to reverse symptoms.
But I'm very much into nutrition and want to loose a proper weight without any fad diets. I want to take a balanced approach, loose weight healthily, to sustain long term approach and get my nutrition on point. I'm a pure vegetarian, sometimes I eat eggs but not possible to cook at home everyday. Challenge is to get Omega, vit d, protein through diet, I'll slowly want to reduce dependency on supplements and shift naturally the things I could get from food but for now, I want to fix all symptoms and get back to my normal self. Taking normaz for myo inositol, earthful cal+vit d+k2, delivery pending. 
I had to order biotrex k2, I didn't read properly regarding the company but I want to switch to healthier version soon, I have stretched my budget 3x to seriously start it, this might not be sustainable to import from IHerb, it was just one time investment but I'll have to source it from local sources soon.
So any inputs about what's missing, recommendations, how should I start with what, will be appreciated. ",3.0,https://i.redd.it/ww3scv0ozg5f1.png,Minimum_Spare1756,2025-06-07 01:59:28,11.0,post,,,

Supplements,fatty liver,1kcsgac,What's good for kidneys?,"Hi all,

I don't have any existing kidney issues (that I'm aware of, knocks on wood), but it's something I'd like to be more careful about in terms of preventive efforts. I once had elevated liver enzymes, tried taking regular milk thistle, and didn't see any improvements in my numbers over the course of 18 months with checks at 6-month intervals. I ran across a liposomal version licensed as Siliphos, tried it, and have had healthier liver numbers ever since, even while continuing to have fatty liver (non-alcoholic) prior to some weight loss.

I'm wondering if there is anything comparable out there that others have found to be effective for overall kidney health. e.g., Has anything helped with wonky kidney numbers as it regards supplement use?

Supplements,fatty liver,1il41ic,One Month of Supplements/Nootropics in 2 Hours,"When you start discovering the benefits of certain supplements by taking them regularly, you can’t do without them. Over time, more and more supplements accumulate, making it a real chore to take them consistently.

I created this system to minimize friction as much as possible. That moment when you think:""Fuck! It’s 7:50 AM, and I start work at 8. Forget it for today! I have better things to do than unscrew a plastic bottle, swallow a pill, and screw it back—ten times in a row.""

To avoid this, each month, I prepare 3 sets of 30 plastic bags filled with the supplements I plan to take in either capsule or powder form (cheaper) using a milligram scale and spoons of various sizes.

I say 3 sets of 30 rather than 90 because I actually prepare three different stacks, categorized by color:
White ⚪ for water-soluble supplements (bioavailable in water).
Red 🔴 for fat-soluble supplements (bioavailable in fats).
Black ⚫ for supplements intended to improve sleep quality.

Routine

Morning: I empty a white ⚪ water-soluble sachet into a 1L water bottle. I refill it once or twice when it reaches half, to dilute the effects throughout the day.
Tip: Use a metal bottle. If your water-soluble supplements have a strong color and you're using a clear plastic bottle, people will give you suspicious looks, as if you're drinking a liter of liquid crap. I learned this the hard way. Also, wash the bottle at least twice a week, or else horrifying mold will develop, seeking your demise. Again, I learned this the hard way.

Midday or Morning: I take a red 🔴 fat-soluble sachet with healthy fats—eggs drenched in olive oil, fatty fish, an avocado, or cod liver oil.

Evening: I take a black ⚫ sleep stack one hour before bed (or a few minutes before if I forget).

That’s about it for my system. When I travel, I take a few small dealer-style baggies with me. Since setting this up, I’ve significantly improved my discipline and consistency, which I believe has allowed me to get the best out of each compound.






My Current Stacks
For the curious, here’s what’s in my current stacks. I’m not excessively meticulous, Since I manually measure powdered dosages I estimate a ±15% margin of error 
 
I - WATER-SOLUBLE SUPPLEMENTS

1) Mainly for sports performance:

5g Creatine Monohydrate (maintenance dose)
1.5g TMG (Trimethylglycine)
1g Taurine
200mg Tongkat Ali 2% (recent addition; taking it for a few days but might drop it because the taste is absolutely disgusting)

2) For cognitive enhancement:

300mg Alpha GPC 99% (every other day)
250mg Citicoline (every other day, meaning I fill half my sachets with Citicoline and the other half with Alpha GPC and let chance decide)
5mg Electrolyte Powder (to maintain optimal hydration levels)
250mg Cordyceps 10:1 (recent addition, mostly out of curiosity—maybe I fell for the brand’s marketing)
500mg Lion’s Mane (currently out of reliable sources like Oriveda or Nootropics Depot, so I’m wasting money on less trustworthy, non-extracted alternatives for now. Fortunately, I’m among the 90% who tolerate Lion’s Mane well—never experienced the awful symptoms some report.)

II - FAT-SOLUBLE SUPPLEMENTS

400mg Sunflower Lecithin (for its phosphatidylcholine content)
3000 IU Vitamin D3 + 135 mcg K2 (considering switching to 5000 IU since my trusted brand recently released capsules at that dosage—might try them)
1000mg Omega-3 (including 800mg DHA / 160mg EPA; using a supermarket brand because this stuff is expensive, but heavy metal contamination is a concern—any recommendations for high-quality, affordable Omega-3s are welcome)
1 capful of Cod Liver Oil (about once every 4 days; just another source of good fats—useful when I don’t feel like making eggs)

III - SLEEP SUPPLEMENTS

360mg Magnesium Bisglycinate
300mg Magnesium L-Threonate (the dose might be a bit low, but I already feel a subtle benefit)
1g Taurine

IV - OTHER COMPOUNDS

These are supplements I take occasionally for specific needs—mostly stimulants reserved for particular situations, but not exclusively:
7mg Nicotine Patch (2–3 times per week, always spaced 2 days apart)
Intranasal Cortexin (for 4–5 days, 1 week out of 3)
Phenylpiracetam (once every two weeks)
50mg Modafinil (once a month or less)
200mg L-Theanine (once a week)
Psilocybin Mushrooms (2–3 times per year).

Any respectful and reasonable optimization suggestions are welcome.
I'm missing a good vitamin B complex (ideally in powder form). I use Life Extension tablets from time to time but I find them too strong for regular use.

You want to separate your fat and carbs in your diet.

Two things about your liver and diet. 

1. Never do keto full time. 

2. When not on keto, embrace complex carbs full on and use almost no fat. 

Swap out low carb diet for just zero simple carbs, and very low levels of fats. Free floating carbs and fats in the blood stream together cause fatty liver and arterial plaque. 

Get your fat during your fat burning days.

Supplements,fatty liver,1fcyjra,Milk Thistle Experience,"I have had an extremely positive experience with milk thistle, and I am not exactly sure why.

I originally started on milk thistle about a month ago. I've had elevated liver enzymes in the last few blood tests, and a recent CAT scan showed that I had the beginnings of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), so I started it due to its literature evidence towards liver support.

Since taking it, here are the positive effects I've had:
(1) More positive mood and stability. Enjoy music more. More alert and self-assured.
(2) Significantly increased libido
(3) Decreased facial and stomach bloating
(4) Less acne
(5) Much less back pain and irritability.

I am not sure why it has such a positive effect,  especially with libido. The effect has persisted in the past month, and I haven't changed much in my stack since then. I generally eat healthy and don't have added sugar or many carbohydrates, but that diet was stable before starting thistle and seeing those effects.

Overtime whenever I stopped eating whey I’d lose weight but when I have whey protein shakes I bloat and chubby up.

I have no idea why this happens ,I suspected it’s connected to the sucralose in them giving me non alcoholic fatty liver, but I puff up even when I take the ones sweetened with stevia.

Supposedly whey is one of the healthiest things for you and especially Bulk Powders whey is supposed to be grass fed.

Supplements,fatty liver,1d3euj4,How stupid is this supplement list I'm taking between all my pills?,"So yea, I'm taking about \~10 different supplements per day and while I just have all of the items on my spreadsheet, I'm curious how ""stupid"" of a dosage these are. Of course some of the obscure dosages are because they are contained in multiple different supplements but still.

I don't have any known deficiencies and I only started taking all of the supplements because of supposedly having a fatty liver (non-alcoholic), being obsese and sedentary (down 50 lbs since starting weight loss and walking daily for the past 2 months) so I'm trying to ultimately change my lifestyle.

Personally, I feel supplements are all placebo for me as I never feel any different when I take anything but whatever I have the disposable income.

Also, I suppose I'll ask just to see any commentors thoughts here but would any of these (or any supplements in general you can think of) change the color of your urine unless you really diluted it with a lot of water? Sometimes I notice my urine is a very deep yellow and labs/urinalysis never show anything abnormal but just curious.

Anyway, I've always been (knowing it's not always ""safe"" but still) an OTC supplement type of person without a second thought. ""Oh, I can take 2 2000mg of vit c everyday and it will keep me healthy!!11"" knowing I'm just going to piss almost all of it out. However, I do know there is actual deficiencies that people can have and I'm curious how to go about ""finding out"" if I'm honestly taking supplements for no real reason/benefit/gain.

Mind you, I haven't been taking anything prior to 2 months ago, but as stupid as I am, I do a bunch of research find all these supplements that supposedly help (with healthy diet and exercise of course - down 38lbs in the past 1.5 months) the liver like Milk Thistle, TUDCA, B-complex, Vit E, D3, K2, Krill Oil and CoQ10 but I'm hesitant per se of asking my doctor if I'm stupid or not. I'm also not really sure any labs to ask for that can actually show me if I have any actual vitamin deficiencies or not.

Supplements,fatty liver,1cagh77,"Bile flow is essential for the liver, as it continuously borrows phosphatidylcholine (PC) from liver membranes. PC plays a crucial role in assisting the liver in detoxifying the body by facilitating the removal of toxins, thus helping to maintain its strength and functionality.","Phosphatidylcholine (PC) plays a crucial role in bile flow, a process essential for the elimination of toxins from the body. Bile, produced by the liver, contains bile acids and phospholipids, including PC. PC acts as a major component of bile, aiding in the emulsification and transport of fats and fat-soluble toxins. 

Impaired bile flow can lead to various health issues, including:

1. Digestive complications: Bile is essential for the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble vitamins. Impaired bile flow can result in difficulties digesting fatty foods, leading to symptoms such as bloating, gas, and diarrhea.

2. Jaundice: Bilirubin, a yellow pigment produced during the breakdown of red blood cells, is excreted in bile. When bile flow is impaired, bilirubin can accumulate in the bloodstream, leading to jaundice, characterized by yellowing of the skin and eyes.

3. Gallstones: Bile helps to maintain the solubility of cholesterol and other components in the gallbladder. Impaired bile flow can contribute to the formation of gallstones, which can cause severe pain and complications if they block the bile ducts.

4. Toxic accumulation:  Bile serves as a vehicle for the elimination of waste products and toxins from the liver. When bile flow is impaired, toxins may accumulate in the liver and bloodstream, potentially leading to systemic toxicity and liver damage.

5. Nutritional deficiencies: Impaired bile flow can interfere with the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and essential fatty acids, leading to nutritional deficiencies over time.

Recommendations for food with a good amount of phospholipids such as PC include egg yolks, soybeans and soy products like tofu and tempeh, liver, fatty fish, and sunflower seeds.

Overall, impaired bile flow can have significant implications for digestion, liver function, and overall health, highlighting the importance of supporting bile flow for optimal well-being.

PC is crucial for optimal health, especially considering the challenges posed by overwhelming circumstances, inadequate dietary intake, and toxin exposure. Many of us aren't getting enough PC and struggle to absorb nutrients effectively. That's why, when addressing digestive issues and related toxicities with my clients, I often suggest supplementing with highly bioavailable PC complexes like [BodyBio PC](https://bodybio.com/products/bodybio-pc-phosphatidylcholine), [Quicksilver Scientific Pure PC](https://www.quicksilverscientific.com/all-products/pure-pc-micellized/), or [Membrane Mend](https://www.quicksilverscientific.com/all-products/membrane-mend/).

Like mentioned in the post, phospholipids play several roles in the body, including supporting detoxification and bile flow, as well as addressing mold toxicity.

Phospholipids, such as phosphatidylcholine (PC), are essential components of cell membranes. They help maintain the structural integrity of cells, including liver cells involved in detoxification processes. By supporting healthy liver function, phospholipids indirectly aid in the body's detoxification pathways.

They are also crucial components of bile, a substance produced by the liver that aids in the digestion and absorption of fats and fat-soluble nutrients. Phospholipids help emulsify fats in the digestive tract, allowing them to be broken down and absorbed more efficiently. This process supports proper bile flow and prevents the formation of gallstones.

Phospholipids have been studied for their potential to help address mold toxicity. Mold toxins disrupt cellular membranes and lead to various health issues. Phospholipids help repair and protect cell membranes from damage caused by mycotoxins, thereby mitigating their harmful effects.

Overall, phospholipids support detoxification by promoting healthy liver function, aid in bile flow for efficient fat digestion, and help address mold toxicity by protecting cell membranes from damage. Incorporating phospholipid-rich foods or supplements, such as lecithin or krill oil, can help support these functions in the body. However, it's essential to consult with a healthcare professional before starting any new supplement regimen, especially if addressing specific health concerns like mold toxicity. Although, PC is not the only piece of the puzzle for mold toxicity.",1.0

Supplements,fatty liver,1c1rnwz,Please review my noob stack," Hi everyone,

First of all, sorry, English is my third language, I will make many language errors.

I'd like advice on and some help with my (crazy huge) stack.

44 years old male. Until 6 weeks ago I had a very unhealthy, bad lifestyle. Much alcohol, fast food, constant stress from work, bad sleep etc. I was at BMI +30, while until my late 30's I was slightly underweight even. Then 6 weeks ago it happened, I crashed and ended up in hospital. Luckily after checks there is no sign of major issues (yet) and I was dismissed with fatty liver disease - which was diagnosed after a CT-scan, slightly elevetad liver set, particulary gamma GT. Amazingly, cholesterol levels were within normal range, and the rest of the blood tests were not too bad after all. Could have been far worse. However, this was a wake up call.

So I stopped drinking alcohol. No more junk food. Avoid sugar. Started eating fruit, vegetables, fibres ... just a 'normal' healthy diet. I have little of no exercise, do walk a lot, but nothing too intense (yet). A man has got to stort somewhere, no.

Also this early stage turnaround in lifestyle (+- 6 weeks now) lead to me googling all kinds of liver cleaning foods and supplements ... and frankly, I just could not stop ordering more stuff. So now - as a total noob - I probably have a bad stack. I wonder what I could keep on taking together what can I park for later or even stop, what can I cycle and what about dosing. What can I add or replace, etc.

Thanks in advance. Every input will be greatly appreciated.

Well, here is my daily menu as it is at the moment:

I'll add some to the list right away :-) The fructooligosaccharide prebiotic in the ""Life Extension Liver Restore"" is also interesting. I might order that product or add a prebiotic to my probio's. Will read into it.   
  
What is your opinion on the dosages? I keep them low, one of the reasons is indeed the possible adverse effects of going pro-oxidant instead of anti-oxidant. Might I be better of to cut some things out for now to cycle these later, and / or increase dosage on some of the stuff?",2.0

At least my sense is that approaching it from multiple angles is better than trying to sledge hammer it from one. Your dietary changes are doing the heavy lifting; supplements are helping it along. The only supplements I still take daily on an ongoing basis are the general support multi, milk thistle, turmeric, etc. The more targeted extra NAC, C, TUDCA, and Siliphos combo is when I have a heavy or higher fat meal. TUDCA is a bile acid and specifically helps the liver and gall bladder handle fats.

You seem to have a good handle on researching nutrition and supplements and are dealing with the issues well. I think if you just keep doing what you’re doing you’ll be very pleased with the results.",2.0

Must say, when the antioxidants arrived and were first added to the more 'familiar' stuff like vitamins, minerals, Omega 3 and herbs, it felt like I almost got high on them. Obviously the body had to adapt and reacted almost instantly with a significant energy boost in the first half of the day and rebound later in the afternoon, along with 2 evenings with mild headache, wich I normally have very very seldom. 

But after a week or so everything got more stable and wow I haven't felt so 'fresh' in years. Sleep gets better and better too. I plan too continue this stack for a month or two, maybe, then try to cycle some combinations or keep it to the basics like you and see from there. By that time the healthier lifestyle should be the new normal to body and mind and I can better judge possible placebo-effects.

A nice side-effect of these 'experiments' is that they present me with an extra motivational factor. It's kind of fun and exciting too look forward to more healthy experiments and to fine tune the supps or to discover some new stuff. Of course that would not make much sense if I'd start to drink or eat crap again every day. So yeah, looking forward to the summertime already.

Supplements,fatty liver,1anbeze,A doctor´s supplement protocol - thoughts?,"I recently found a great blog about all things biohacking. There is also one article on supplements, which I found very interesting and I learned a great deal from.

Link to the article: [**Supplements I Take And Why I Take Them**](https://desmolysium.com/supplements-i-take/)

The author, who appears to be a doctor/med students from the way he writes about medicine/physiology (but he does not claim to be), takes the following supplements:

**Morning:**

* 1g sodium chloride
* 2400mg lecithin
* 500mg L-carnitine
* 1g TMG
* 1 mg L-methyl folate
* 2g creatine HCL

**Noon:**

* 1g beta-alanine
* 45mcg VitK2
* 100mg alpha-lipoic acid
* 2g EPA/DHA
* 3.000 IU vitamin D
* 250mg VitC
* 60mg CoQ10

**Evening:**

* 400mg magnesium
* 500mg inositol
* 5g glycine
* 500mg taurine
* 300mg NAC

In the article, the author explains each of these in more detail, why he takes them, and the adverse effects/risks he has experienced. There were many new and interesting points raised for me and I learned a great deal. Here a couple of things I found interesting and worth sharing.

* Supplementing with salt tablets (for people who mostly eat non-processed foods) is an option
* ""there is a huge range of vitamin D blood levels and it is hard to say whether a vitamin D blood level of 30ng/dl in person A is equivalent to 30ng/dl in person B. All else being equal, if parathyroid hormone (PTH) is high, vitamin D action is (probably) low.""
* Prescription iron is an option - an much cheaper than supplemental iron
* Vitamin B12 injections >> oral supplements
* ""Furthermore, niacin activates the hydroxycarboxylic acid receptor 2, which causes flushing (good for the skin), prevents lipolysis and therefore lowers blood lipids, leads to rebound ketogenesis, and has anti-inflammatory effects in a variety of tissues. Some mental health researchers swear by high-dose niacin but whether there is anything to it is not known.""
* Flush-niacin is a great substitute for NMN but can cause laryngeal and ocular edema.
* Creatine HCL has much less water retention than creatine monohydrate.
* Alpha-lipoid acid as a great antioxidant-enzyme inducer
* "" Interestingly, glycine passed the Interventions Testing Program (ITP) of the National Institute of Aging, prolonging the lifespan of mice by a tiny but statistically significant amount (4%). However, they put glycine in the chow, which is different than a megadose on an empty stomach, thereby probably having a different safety and effect profile. Paradoxically, glycine is known to activate mTORC1, which should have pro-aging effects. ""
* A choline deficiency is associated with decreased cognition, depression, atherosclerosis, increased homocysteine levels, and fatty liver disease.
* The author avoids herbal supplements

Well, there were many more interesting points in the article, I just mentioned a couple of them. I highly recommend the article: [**Supplements I Take And Why I Take Them**](https://desmolysium.com/supplements-i-take/)

If you only have 1 drink, then take 1. There's a lot of zinc and selenium in there, but the NAC kind of binds to zinc, and selenium is used to make glutathione.

However, for long term usage, I strongly prefer s acetyl glutathione. It has less side effects for me. 

I'm 90% sure if someone tested blood alcohol levels, pretreated with NAC, the NAC will dramatically increase the rate your liver metabolizes alcohol.

Supplements,fatty liver,18v30w6,How effective are these supplements at lowering cholesterol and blood pressure?,"Age:25

Gender: F

Weight: 229 lbs

Height: 5’4 ft

Medication: 60 mg Cymbalta 2x daily, 60 mg of propranolol twice daily, Metformin 500 mg, Mirtazipine 30 mg, Nurtec 75 mg as needed

For 3 weeks, I’ve noticed that my blood pressure and heart rate has been high. On Thursday, I had a doctor’s appointment and they ran some blood tests as well as did an EKG and ordered me to be fitted for a heart rate monitor to wear for 24 hours. He also wants me to be retested for sleep apnea and to see a dietician. My test results for cholesterol came back pretty high. This is it: 

Cholesterol: 268

HDL: 50

Triglycerides: 172

LDL:186

My PCP doesn’t want to prescribe a statin for my cholesterol or anything for blood pressure since she says my cardiovascular risk is low. All she said was work on losing weight, exercise more, and stick to low a low carb and low fat diet. She wasn’t too concerned since my cardiovascular risk is low, but I still feel pretty worried. I have a referral to see a dietician as well as to see a sleep specialist regarding the sleep apnea. My EKG and all other blood tests came back normal. 

I plan on increasing my exercise to 30 mins 5x a week, sticking to a DASH diet and working on losing weight. For weight loss I plan on doing intermittent fasting and look into doing keto. For exercise I plan on walking on my treadmill for 30 mins to start and practicing yoga. It’s going to be pretty hard for me to lose weight tho since I have PCOS and my insurance doesn’t cover any weight loss treatments. 

I was also thinking of taking these supplements: 

Trader Joe’s Omega 3 Fatty Acids supplement 2x per day 

2 g Plant Sterols 

600 mg Aged Garlic Extract 2x per day

40 g of Psyllium Fiber per day 

Nature’s Blend B Complex

I’m wondering how effective these supplements are for lowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels and as far as how safe they all are? I do have a pretty sensitive stomach so I’m unsure if I should take the garlic extract or not. As far as medical conditions go, I get migraines, I have GERD, nonalcoholic fatty liver and just got over a H Pylori infection",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/18v30w6/how_effective_are_these_supplements_at_lowering/,spazthejam43,2023-12-31 00:07:30,3.0,post,,,

1) in another Reddit thread a bunch of people said taking it daily will cause liver damage but I found this study saying it has actually been used to heal fatty liver… https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK591552/ — so why were people in multiple Reddit threads saying the oil will damage your liver over time?

2) in another thread they said it is a MAOI… they said this as if it was a bad thing. What exactly does that mean and why would it be bad?

>Polystyrene nanoplastics penetrate across the blood-brain barrier and induce activation of microglia in the brain of mice
>
>In pathological conditions such as neurodegeneration in the Parkinson's disease (PD), microglia are activated, migrated to the injury site, and prone to engulf debris, sense pathology, and secrete possible pro- and anti-inflammatory factors
>
>Inflammation-mediated neurodegeneration involves activation of the brain's resident immune cells, the microglia, which produce proinflammatory and neurotoxic factors, including cytokines, reactive oxygen intermediates, nitric oxide, and eicosanoids that impact on neurons to induce neurodegeneration. Hence, identification of compounds that prevent microglial activation may be highly desirable in the search for therapeutic agents for inflammation-mediated neurodegenerative diseases

- Dextromethorphan

In this study, we report that dextromethorphan (DM), an ingredient widely used in antitussive remedies, reduced the inflammation-mediated degeneration of dopaminergic neurons through inhibition of microglial activation. The neuroprotective effect of DM was attributed to inhibition of LPS-stimulated microglial activation because DM significantly inhibited the LPS-induced production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha, nitric oxide, and superoxide free radicals

- Nicotine Patches

Nicotine inhibits H+ currents of microglia via interactions with α7 nAChRs. This means that α7 nAChRs agonists may have a therapeutic potential via regulation of microglial activation in neuroinflammatory diseases

- Taurine

Taurine inhibited KDM3a and microglia activation, thereby playing an anti-inflammatory role in LPS-treated mice and BV-2 cells

- L-Theanine

These results suggest that the mechanism of action of L-theanine, may partly depend on suppressing microglial activation in the LCSPT circuit related encephalic region and recovery of neurogenesis in the hippocampus

L-theanine treatment effectively reduced the immunohistochemical hallmarks of Parkinson's disease, particularly Lewy bodies and α-synuclein, and increased the number of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive cells. L-theanine also improved the motor dysfunction in MPTP-induced.

For context I’m a recovering alcoholic and I have been many times long term sober, now I have maybe one or two beers with my meal but that’s stopping.

I struggle to cook in my accommodation as I’m in company accommodation and don’t have a stove so I’ve came here for some advice in a feeling of overwhelmed desperation.

I do exercise but threw my back out doing deadlifts and haven’t been to the gym in around 4 weeks

The posts I’ve read say I should be taking choline, tudca, milk thistle but there’s not many posts I can see that give advice on dosage; some say 300mg choline and some 1500mg but nothing relating to tudca or milk thistle and this is where I ask for your guidance:

What daily supplements should I take and what dosage?

I’m going to go back to 18 hour fasting and eating once per day while also going back to the gym for weights and cardio… I really want to lose some weight on top of giving my body the right supplements 

I’m sorry for the long winded post on something that is discussed multiple times over; just hoping I can get some good advice to do as little damage as possible while I’m out of my home country x",17.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/17i8g1z/fatty_liver_disease_36yrs/,Real_Common1507,2023-10-28 00:21:25,65.0,post,,,

Supplements,fatty liver,17mhvxi,I added up my $100/month regimen. Is everyone here rich?,"Hey everyone,

I'm a big fan of Peter Attia, Andrew Huberman, and David Sinclair, and I'm always looking for ways to improve my health and longevity. I'm currently taking the following supplements:

* Vitamin D3 & K2 (5000 IU / 100mcg)
* Taurine (500mg)
* Glycine (1000mg)
* NAC (600mg)
* Creatine (5g)
* Magnesium (325mg)
* Resveratrol (500mg)
* EPA (1000mg)
* NMN (500mg) (starting in a few days; finishing out my NiaCel as we speak)

I'm spending about $3 per day on supplements, and I'm wondering if there are any ways to save money or improve my stack.

Here are some specific questions I have:

* Are there any cheaper places to buy the same supplements?
* Can I combine any of these supplements into a single product?
* Are there any other supplements that I should consider adding to my stack for heart and brain health, and longevity?
* Am I taking anything that's not really worth the money?

Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

**TL;DR:** I'm taking a variety of supplements for heart and brain health, and longevity. I'm wondering if there are any ways to improve my stack on the same or less money.

Supplements,fatty liver,171jxzg,Belly fat and supplements - revisited,"Hey! Starting a new thread to say 'thanks!'. The [other one](https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/170l7j0/belly_fat_any_supplements_to_help_get_rid_of_it/) got locked.  
(Please don't post any recommendations for illegal drugs…)

Few people asked what **DNA Analysis** I did. I got it from Dr Anthony Jay. Got my genome sequenced with 23AndMe and sent it to him. He does an analysis and then discusses the results with you.  
That was helpful, since those analysis usually produce up to 10 pages of 'defects'. Having someone point out the urgent and important ones is super helpful.

A lot of tips I read on the old threat. Some I'll try out. 

First off:  
**Fasting** \- I do this on a daily cycle. I stop eating at 20:00 and only start eating at 12:00 again. So my gut gets 16 hours of rest in between. Advised to me by Dr Jay since I have two genes that make me less tolerant to gluten. I don't have clear signs of leaky gut, but some indicators that point in my gut being not totally healthy.

**Cortisol** – Is interesting. I read stress and lack of sleep can give you a belly too. But since I have a relatively stress free life, with more that enough sleep, don't think this is the issue.

Also interesting to read that **insulin** regulates lipoprotein lipase. So when you have sugar in your blood, you won't burn fat. I'm already extremely careful with sugar. But this underlines that importance again.

**Berberine** – that one is new for me. And very interesting. It decreases insulin resistance, increases glycolysis and helps break down sugars inside.  
Also it decrease sugar production in your liver, since I have a gene that can cause nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. This is interesting. Will try this one oiut.

**Eca stack** – That's ephedrine, caffeine, and aspirin in one supplement. Ephedrine can be used for short-term weight loss, specifically fat loss. It stimulates thermogenesis in the brown adipose tissue. But there are also unaccounted cases of heart attack. It's forbidden in the Netherlands for this risk. I'll pass.

The question about whether I'm **fat** or **bloated** (yes, thanks), triggered another line of thought: When I'm have a cheat day (or weekend?) I put on a lot of weight, easily two or three pounds. And those disappear again within a week (jay!) but that might be body fluid instead of fat. Probably water that is held for a fight against inflammation.  
Someone suggested **probiotic strains**… That is interesting and might indeed help with the bloating.

So… Berberine and Probiotics – that's what I'll look into.  
(And also: a bit more sports activities and holding on to this new found discipline).

I'll let you guys know.

And let me know if you like to add something to my thoughts now.",3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Supplements/comments/171jxzg/belly_fat_and_supplements_revisited/,HansKorff,2023-10-06 11:30:22,3.0,post,,,
Supplements,fatty liver,171jxzg,Belly fat and supplements - revisited,,,,bbspooks,2023-10-06 21:53:28,,comment,k3tdfi6,"I saw someone mention R-ALA and I've also heard of that stacked with L-Carnitine or CLA. B vitamins. 

The most researched things are going to be caffiene and green tea. Coffee is good. Drink some matcha or green tea too. I've also heard drinking yerba mate or guayusa tea helps. Idk about ketones but if you follow the diet then that might help. The most important of all is getting your daily amount of protein in, which I suggest protein powder over any other supplement if you're not meeting the protein goals for the day. Also weight training alongside of cardio. 3 to 4 times a week, about 60 to 90 minutes tops, with a plan.

There's branded fat burners that people in the fitness industry use to slim down a bit but I don't put a lot of weight on those being helpful to anyone above 10% body fat. These are things like GBB, grains of paradise, MitoBurn, L-BAIBA, CaloriBurn, capsasin (CapsiMax), yohimbine, rauwolfia (alpha yohimbine), InnoSlim, forskolin, synephrine, bitter orange, theobromine. 

I've also heard belly fat is the last to go and also that cortisol levels contribute to it a fair bit. So keeping your stress lower might help. So taking supplements to manage that as well as practices to manage stress could help. Some people use ashwagandha, there's a lot of threads on this subreddit about supplements for managing anxiety and stress etc. Cortisol in general. Just make sure nothing interferes with prescription drugs you take, that goes for all supplements. And take supplements one at a time to see what works for you and what doesn't and in case you have unwanted side effects. 

There's also glucose disposal agents. Berberine is in a lot of them. Insulin resistance plays a big role in fat as well. Other things included in GDAs are glucomannan, konjac, chromium, cinnamon, banaba, citrus bergamot, grapeseed extract, fenugreek, glutathione, DIM, bitter melon.



The TLDR is: managing stress, hitting your protein goals, calorie deficit, weight training and cardio 3 to 4 times a week. Glucose disposal agents (GDAs) are more used by general populis now than they previously were, specifically in the single ingredient of berberine. The ""fat burners"" are really just useful for people sub 10% body fat, prepping for bodybuilding competitions or have their entire careers based around staying lean year round. Otherwise I don't personally see them as beneficial for someone just looking to be healthy longterm. Even GDAs I question in that regard. For supplementation I'd recommend stress (cortisol) reducing supplements and focus on that as well as supplements to help athletic performance in the gym. And maybe berberine. Just stay dialed in on your fitness and nutrition. 

It's also worth noting the need to shake up your metabolism. A long term calorie deficit can actually slow your metabolism down. I recommend doing a cutting cycle (deficit) to a maintenence then back to a cut. Maybe like 6 weeks then 2 weeks then back to a cut. So your metabolism doesn't adjust to the deficit. If it adjusts you'll have to go even lower etc. Your ""deficit"" won't stay the same, just like your ""maintence"" will change. This is why I recommend to focus on your understanding of nutrition and fitness and how the metabolism works and how to do an actual deficit in cycles before you look to supplementation. Consume as much knowledge as you can before consuming any pills as they say. :)",2.0

Supplements,fatty liver,16cto1d,Thoughts on Current Supplement Routine?," Everyday I (26M) feel like I’m learning new things by reading up on supplements and seeing how my body reacts to new ones. Here’s a bit of medical history: 

\-Countless days and nights of (especially lower) abdominal pain, attributed to very poor diet as a kid killing my microbiome and digestive health. Though I cleaned up my diet and started taking probiotics this past year

\-General anxiety/OCD symptoms since early childhood, possibly also connected to the above issue

\-Sharp pain on right side, starting around college. Initially I thought it was connected to the liver or gallbladder (I’ve always had elevated liver enzyme levels) as this flares up after drinking or eating fatty foods.  

\-Very recently, similar right-sided pain was the result of a massive kidney stone.

\-Possible hyperthyroidism? I’ve always tested low in TSH, normal in hormone levels

\-Long Covid sufferer for the past 1.5 years. Ever since getting it I’ve had noticeable fatigue - especially after exercising, a reduction in exercise capacity, dysphagia, indigestion/burping, feeling stuffy/sick more often, and brain fog. I could be extra-anxious because doctors haven’t noticed anything, but I sometimes wake up and feel a lump in my throat. I’m worried the extra burping and trouble with swallowing, thyroid issue, and COVID are all connected.

&#x200B;

My diet usually consists of drinking lots of water and eating a keto-ish low oxalate diet that’s heavy on lean meats and nutritious vegetables. Currently, my daily routine of supplements and time having taken them is:

\-Years of probiotics (Seed over the past year). Night and day difference with my intestinal health.

\-6 months of B complex. Over the past month I switched to Ancient Nutrition B Complex which has the methylated forms of folate and B12. I’ve noticed a sharp reduction in the number of times I have right-side pain (though not gone completely), reduction in dysphagia/indigestion/burping, and slight uptick in energy - especially after switching to the methylated forms.

\-5 months of D3 (5000mg). I also tested vitamin D deficient earlier last winter. I’ve noticed this helps with in clearing my seasonal depression and overall mood. Everyone says to incorporate K2, but after trying to add it for a week I noticed consistent sharp pain in my right side. I would consider trying again, but I fear another liver/kidney attack if I do.

\-3 months of Nordic Naturals Omega 3 (2150mg) and Vitamin D3 (1000mg). I’m unsure of the benefits yet, but possibly it gives an effect of reducing inflammation, boosting brainpower and immune health. Just doing what the internet recommends. I feel I don’t eat enough seafood anyway.

\-1.5 months of NAC (600mg). This one I feel most happy about, at least for now. I’ve seen a noticeable increase in mood quality and sharp decline in my sometimes addictive personality. Let’s just say certain sugar and drug cravings/addictions in my life have almost vanished after a month of taking. I’m worried though about becoming more sensitive and needing a stronger dose in the future - not sure if this is true having read this on the internet. After my next bottle, I am considering switching to the slow release capsules as opposed to the immediate one I am currently taking.

\-1.5 months Thorne Pic-mins (Zinc, Selenium, Manganese, Chromium, Molybdenum, Vanadium, Boron). I originally started taking this thinking that my fatigue issue was related to mineral imbalance. Now I’m not sure if there is any benefit. Although I check my diet sometimes on Cronometer and see that I’m oftentimes not getting most of these minerals daily.

\-2 weeks of Supplement Studio (Vitamin C, Quercetin, Bromelain, Zinc). Buying enough oranges for the week sometimes gets inconvenient. I feel less inflamed and stressed immediately after any natural form of vitamin C. This does the same for me minus the extra sugar. Also, not sure if the extra Zinc is worth it or not.

\-2 weeks of CoQ10 (100mg). This is a newer supplement I’ve only taken for a couple weeks, but I’ve possibly noticed an increase in energy and possibly a reduction in long covid symptoms.

&#x200B;

Currently it’s the noticeable fatigue, especially with exercise, indigestion/burping and dysphagia that’s my biggest issue. What are you guys’ thoughts? Is there anything I should add, delete, or substitute? I am happy to give an update after this to show any results.

AskDocs,NAFLD,1odapi6,"14 years undiagnosed (30F). My body is facing the consequences, and I’m desperate to finally receive the right treatment. How can I find a doctor who truly thinks outside the box?","TLDR: I’ve been severely ill for 14 years with worsening systemic symptoms that no doctor has connected or properly investigated. Despite an extremely healthy lifestyle and young age, I now have prediabetes, fatty liver and advanced fatty pancreas, arterial plaque, and constant debilitating fatigue and other issues. I’m deteriorating fast, can barely work, and the system keeps dismissing me as “fine.” I urgently need a doctor who can look at my whole case before my health collapses completely.

I’ve been dealing with systemic health issues for 14 years now, since the age of 16 (almost half my life). Over time, I’ve realized that there’s very little space in healthcare to deal with long-term systemic conditions, as the system tends to focus mainly on problems that are easily detectable or straightforward to diagnose. I’m at my wit’s end, because even though I’ve searched hard and learned a great deal about what’s going wrong with my body, I still haven’t found a doctor who is willing to connect the dots. These symptoms have had a severe impact on my life: they’ve affected my ability to go to school, my career choices, how much I can work, how I spend my energy and free time, my hobbies, my financial situation, and even decisions about whether I can start a family in this state. I want to explain in this post why I still don’t have a diagnosis even though it's a long story, because it’s crucial to understanding why I’m completely stuck, what I'm looking for, and why I am absolutely exhausted from having to search my way through the medical system. Please hear me out. I absolutely have no idea where to go anymore. Thank you for your patience.

When I was 16, I suddenly developed a stabbing pain just under my chest, around the midriff in the epigastric region. It lasted for about two weeks and was so severe that it sometimes made it hard to breathe for a minute or so. I went to the GP, but she laughed it off, saying it was probably nothing. The pain eventually went away on its own, but right after that, I developed massive fatigue that came out of nowhere, and it never went away. Over the years, more symptoms appeared: mostly increasing muscle issues, hunger, thirst. Because there wasn’t any single “red flag” symptom, after only minimal testing (a few vitamins, etc.), it was concluded by doctors that the problem is unexplainable.

Back then, my lifestyle was already fine. But over the past decade, I have done everything possible to be as kind as I can to my body and live in the healthiest way imaginable. I cut out all added sugars completely. I have never drunk alcohol or smoked, I maybe eat fast food twice a year at most. I bicycle everywhere each day and stay physically active. I also noticed early on that carbohydrates affect me very strongly: I seem to experience (subjective) massive blood sugar swings whenever I eat them, even when they’re complex carbs. For example, eating even whole-grain products, even combined with enough healthy(!) fats and protein, leaves me hungrier than before or makes me extremely sleepy and shaky, even with the smallest amounts of carbs. Because of this, I’ve been lower-carb to varying degrees for nearly a decade now. Despite this, all my symptoms remain. They just become even worse if I don’t live an absolutely strict, “perfectly pure” healthy lifestyle. I won’t go into every single symptom here, but you can ask if relevant.

Over the past ten years, I’ve also been put through various programs required by my health insurance, and to be honest, they’ve been absolute hell for me. The constant focus has been on the idea that I must be doing something wrong in my lifestyle, my mindset, or my physical activity, and that I just need to change that endlessly. For example, I was told that my hunger wasn’t real, but rather probably emotional eating, even when I explained that I experienced excruciating nightly hunger that keeps me often awake for an hour to hours. Or that my fatigue wasn’t actual tiredness, but a mental or motivational issue. That my muscle issues are deconditioning, or else it's overconditioning, or central sensitization. I have been told so many times to eat less unhealthy, drink less alcohol, be less inactive, and stop smoking, even though I already don't do any of these things, it's also just standard advice.

Every time I asked to see a specialist, I was instead sent back into these programs. When I finally did get referrals, the referral letters were written to “exclude a physical cause.” That meant that the specialists didn’t do much further testing, they just sent me back to CBT or GET again. The underlying conviction was always the same: that there could be absolutely nothing wrong with my body, even though it was not really tested thoroughly. I should add that a family member of mine went through the exact same process with the same GP a few years later. She was sick for a year, couldn't work and couldn't do many physical activities anymore, and her symptoms were labeled as “central sensitization” and IBS during that time. After pushing hard for more tests, it turned out to be stage four pancreatic cancer, and she sadly passed away shortly after. I’m not mentioning this because I think I have cancer, but to show that this system is not infallible and that physical issues can and do get missed. I have switched GP but by now my medical record is already quite smudged and on top of that I noticed this is also an insurance issue.

Eventually, last year, I decided to go to an academic hospital and pay out of pocket for more extensive standard testing, something that hadn’t been done for me in over a decade. I had standard blood work, an abdominal ultrasound, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) done, for the first time in 13 years.

The results were as follows:

* Prediabetes: glucose levels were only the the prediabetic range at the peak, but insulin levels were massively elevated, and elevated HOMA-IR.
* Fatty liver.
* Advanced pancreatic lipomatosis.
* Plaque in the arteries, including in the carotid arteries.
* A remarkable amount of gas in the abdomen (it even complicated the process of the ultrasound), which my physiotherapist had already noted several times before, though it hasn't given me noticeable symptoms to everyone's surprise.

Though there was still no absolutely alarming findings: no official diabetes, organ failure or fibrosis (yet), this was surprising to me, considering my healthy lifestyle and a BMI of 21, and that I was only 29 years old. I understand that lean-NAFLD exists, but what concerns me most is that my organs are already in poor condition despite such a healthy lifestyle, and mostly these findings combined with that I also feel absolutely terrible. The problem is that I’ve already been living the prescribed lifestyle for these conditions for years, and yet I’ve still developed them. That means there’s currently no way for me to stop the progression.

Following the hospital’s advice, I made an appointment with a gastroenterologist to investigate a possible cause for the fatty organs. I paid for this visit myself and asked in advance whether the specialist would look at the whole digestive system and the metabolism connected to it. I was told he would focus on the complete digestive system as a whole. However, during the appointment, the doctor only focused on the liver, saying it looked fine since there was no fibrosis. He added that fatty liver occurs often and is just a natural variation, advising me to “just live my life” and check again in a year. I stressed that I’m a young woman with a healthy lifestyle, yet I’m experiencing severe, worsening symptoms that are making my life increasingly unlivable. I pointed out that the issue isn’t just the fatty liver, but also all the other things. And that original stabbing chest pain, which I always mention, is completely ignored every single time. While I just want the question answered: what is the cause of these things together as a whole, and how to treat it? And even if a cause can't be found: I need some kind of treatment, care, and supervision with my issues.

He responded that for muscle issues I should go to a neurologist, for glucose issues to a diabetologist (who, with the same logic, might just say it’s “only prediabetes” and therefore not serious), and for arteries to a phlebologist, etc. In other words, each issue belongs to a different specialist, and no one looks at the overall picture. But I can’t wait until my condition worsens to the point where I finally have full-blown diabetes, actual fibrosis, or such severe symptoms that I can’t work at all anymore before someone takes it seriously. I also can’t financially afford (and timewise, cause this might take literal years) to see all these individual doctors privately, one after another, only for each to say that their specific part looks fine. Because of my health, I can only work part-time already, and I can't get any disability benefits because on paper I'm healthy as a horse. And I can’t go through the insured system again, because they’ll just send me back to CBT or GET instead of proper medical testing. My quality of life is getting lower and lower with each passing year.

So, where do I go from here? Where can I find a doctor who will connect the dots and truly understand the severity of this situation and understand that this is not normal for a woman going through her teens, twenties, and early thirties? I need someone who has access to testing and who can also refer me to the right specialists, while keeping the whole picture in mind, so I don’t have to keep re-explaining and fighting to be taken seriously.  For context: I am in the Netherlands, but am very willing to travel to Germany, Belgium, Luxemburg, or even France if needed.

Prediabetes is usually asymptomatic so doesn’t really explain anything. 

Fatty liver is super common and MASLD should not be diagnosed based just on a bit of fat on one ultrasound scan. This finding could be totally irrelevant. 

Arterial plaque— you didn’t say if this was found to be more severe than expected for your age or anything, so I’m not sure. Almost everyone in their 30s has at least some atherosclerosis so it depends how much, how it was detected, etc. 

Advanced fatty pancreas is not a term I have ever heard before. In a lean person I would assume it’s just a variant of normal. There is always some fat in/around the pancreas. 

Gas in bowels is normal and I’m not sure there is any amount that would automatically be considered pathologic as opposed to just within range of normal. And as you said, in that respect you don’t seem to have any related symptoms. 

Fatigue and hunger seem to be your most severe symptoms. Like others have said these don’t always (or often) have a findable explanation or fixable underlying problem. If anyone might be able to find an exotic underlying problem it’s probably an endocrinologist.",71.0

I’d like to give a bit more context to clarify what I’m running into and what I’m looking for.

I’ve already seen a private endocrinologist who ran standard tests (TSH, cortisol, etc.), which were normal. It is however good advice you gave, cause it definately fits my symptoms. However, the issue is that once those common causes are excluded, the conclusion tends to be “you’re healthy,” rather than asking what else it could be\*.\* I don’t believe it’s something extremely rare, just something outside the usual checklist. I’d also like someone to consider how the sudden chest/epigastric pain that started everything might connect to the later metabolic findings, and to the symptoms alltogether (not just one). It feels a bit like a standard script is run, which I don't say to critisize the individual doctor, but for me it just adds to the personal frustration.

In academic clinics, the process is slow and fragmented: brief appointments, long waits for results, and limited follow-up if nothing directly gets found. At the clinic I went to it took 2,5 months to get the results of the tests, then another 1,5 month to ask for clarification on the result. I don't want to critique the system as I understand how overburdened the medical system is. However, ideally for my personal situation given how complex it seems and that I've already been waiting for 14 years, I’d like to find a more accessible internist who can look at the whole picture and help coordinate next steps. Even if he would have access to less testing, that he at least knows about what options exists in the medical world and what centers are best for that. I am willing to see someone privately for that as long as it gets my situation finally thorougly considered. Do you have any advice on where to look for that kind of care?",7.0

I'm going through an undiagnosed health issue as well, which caused me to see a lot of specialists which resulted in me finding most of the same ""*issues*"" as you have found. I have learned they are all very common, non-concerning issues that many people have and don't even realize since most times they don't progress into anything serious. Literally, in the last few weeks I found out I have pre-diabetes, NAFLD, arterial plaque, and a lot of gas. Out of everything you said, the pancreas is the only thing I don't have (or at least haven't had specifically checked out).

So fortunately none of those things are abnormal, as many people have them, surprisingly. And some aren't always due to lifestyle, other times they can be caused by genetics.

AskDocs,NAFLD,1jpd8f0,Ultrasound suggestive of cirrhosis - freaking out.,"I had an ultrasound that was suggestive of cirrhosis.  I finally got in with a GI after calling for 6 weeks because places are so full.  The doctor was ""perplexed"" because all of my bloodwork was normal.  He had me scheduled for a Fibroscan but the soonest available appointment is 2.5 months.  I don't know how to get it done sooner other than to call constantly.  Any suggestions?

  
US report stated, ""coarse echogenicity with nodular contour consistent with cirrhosis.."" size 17cm.  Everything else was normal.

No smoking, drugs, marijuana.  No prescription drugs.  I was on a low dose of xanax .25mg hs prn.  I quit taking it though.  I was on and off of it several years.  Took 1200mg Trileptal bid from 19 - 27 for seizures.  Just occasional allergy, OTC pain meds, etc.  I'm very conscious of the dosing on the back.

Symptoms - URQ pain, dull ache.  Occasional nausea

Travel outside US - No.

I'm not looking for a diagnosis on here, but I have no where else to turn until my appointment months from now.

Any feedback would be appreciated.  I feel so helpless.  If I went to an ER, would they do a fibroscan?  Just waiting for over two months is torture.

Cirrhosis is a clinical diagnosis. The concept of cirrhosis liver morphology may be supported by ultrasound findings of liver contour modularity and course echotexture. However, in my experience it is easy to overcall this due to technical and anatomical factors. (My flair is years old I need to update my flair I am a radiology resident ). 

The fibroscan will give an estimated stiffness which translates to a “risk for clinically significant fibrosis.” If the number is discordant it really could mean a lot of things, not limited to a false positive. That being said, we see cases of people who match your description with real liver disease.

If I saw what you were reported to have, without a diagnosis of cirrhosis, I would call it morphologic features of chronic liver disease instead. This is because it is not the radiologists call to make, it is the clinician who is usually supported by radiology, pathology (by biopsy) and clinical findings/labs.

AskDocs,NAFLD,1jloo67,I had IV contrast go into my artery for a CT scan.,"I (female, 29, 5'3, 250 on Wegovy for 1.5 years for insulin resistance paired with diet and exercise 4-5 days a week), also on birth control (Yaz) and sprinolactone; have PCOS and just reversing NAFLD), went to the emergency room Monday morning for vomiting and bloody stool (with lower right stomach cramps a few weeks before). Got the usual tests. One being a CT/cat scan from my stomach down.

When I first got checked in the nurse put my IV in, I've had many in my day and have rolling veins so I know they can be painful. When she flushed my IV my hand felt on fire and turned completely white. The nurse said if it went away in a minute or so, it was fine. 20ish minutes later she gave me an IV bag but it wouldn't drip even if she pushed, she couldn't figure out why and mentioned how she'd flushed it a couple times. Then I went for my CT scan. When they put the contrast in, it was the most immense pain I've ever felt in my entire life, the muscles in that arm all contracted and my arm contorted in ways I didn't even know the human body could do. I was screaming in pain and the radiologist stopped after about 10 seconds.

Once the contrast stopped a couldn't control my arm for about a minute and it was just twitching. After a couple minutes it felt completely fine. The radiologist and the nurse talked about it like it was no big deal, didn't warn me of any long term or short term effects this could have.

Here we are 3 days later and the arm hurts incredibly bad. To bend it, mostly to straighten it, it just really really hurts. I'm also have some pain in my leg on that side (maybe unrelated but I don't know). Of course, I got the ol google out, and peer reviewed medical journals say you can get blood clots, gangrene, and lose the limb from this situation (but didn't say specifically for contrast)😩

My questions are, is this likely given my circumstances? What will the real signs be? What type of doctor would I go to be seen about this problem? I don't have a PCP right now after just moving and have been waiting since Feb for a June appointment.

AskDocs,NAFLD,1ivyyf2,Liver? Or just fat and stressed?!,"I (41F, 163cm, 99kg, non-smoker, rarely drink alcohol, from Australia) am trying to get to the bottom of a few health concerns. I do have severe health anxiety, so would appreciate any advice keeping this in mind. Link to relevant bloodwork history: [https://imgur.com/a/v6qlwct](https://imgur.com/a/v6qlwct)

For the past 2.5 years I have had, on and off, itchy skin with and without a rash. I had a few episodes where it felt concentrated in my hands and feet, but I've also had random hives come and go from all over my body, sometimes itchy, sometimes not. Sometimes just red blotches that aren't itchy. I also get mild angioedema on my lips and feet. These random itches/swellings always respond well (ie disappear) to antihistamines. I do know I have an allergy to dustmites, but given we haven't changed anything to do with bedding etc, I doubt they are the cause here. 

At the time of onset, I likely had uncontrolled high blood glucose (although my fasting was 5.2 at the time, I feel that was a fluke, as my at-home testing was showing post-prandial values around 9-10 sometimes). I got my diet and exercise under control, lost 15-20kg, and the hives/itchiness disappeared completely. Also at the time of onset, my GGT was slightly elevated (see pic) - I saw a different GP to my usual one to get the results, she wouldn't have been aware of the itching, and she wasn't concerned about that finding, although did encourage weight loss in response. I have had two more full blood tests since then, and all my liver enzymes have been in normal range.

I have since put back on most of the weight I lost, and my lifestyle has slid back to old habits. I noticed that when this happened, my skin issues started reoccuring. I have got back on top of my diet and exercise again, but it's only been a few weeks proper, so too early to see any noticeable changes, although I am feeling fitter, and less anxious about the whole situation - I tell myself that if I actually had cancer, I wouldn't be able to do all the exercise, work, running around after my family that I do, and certainly not 2.5 years after symptoms started.

I've also been having occasional loose stools (occasional diarhhea, but mostly soft blobs) but these seem to improve when I am less stressed (currently going through the most stressful period of my life doing my PhD - when I take leave from work, my BMs are mostly perfect).

My concern is centred around the itching/rash situation, and the possibility it is liver-related. Even though I have had normal liver enzyme results for the past two years, the weird itching is worrying me. I have no pain where liver pain normally is, and have none of the other symptoms associated with liver problems, besides feeling tired, but I know that could be lots of things - I've noticed I've been feeling more tired since worrying about all of this! I do feel the itching is worse when I think about it, and I definitely have a tendency to experience worsening symptoms when I think about them. I just don't want to leave any stone unturned to figure this out - I have a young child who I need to be here for.

I guess my question is - what are the chances this is something nasty such as cancer (my rational brain says 'low', surely if it was something bad my symptoms would have escalated since having them for 2.5 years), and could this random itching just be due to bog standard fatty liver not picked up by blood tests (I know sometimes you can have NAFLD with normal liver enzymes), which will resolve once I've been in the groove of a healthier lifestyle for a little while? Can obesity alone cause elevated liver enzymes?

AskDocs,NAFLD,1hpx4u8,Really scared about blood test results. What are stomatocytes? What’s Anniscytosis??? Cancer??? ,"Can someone please help explain my blood test results. Really scared I have Leukemia/ blood cancer F23

For reference, female, 23, Uk based, sexually active with 1 male partner, recently diagnosed with nafld due to poor diet extending over a year but still concerned about blood cancer. 

2 weeks ago I started experiencing pain in my left hand side on breathing in, only hurt when taking a deep breathe in. A couple days later I noticed my lymph nodes in my groin had swelled up so o booked appt with my GP. She listened, said my oxygen was good, could not identify any obvious reason why I was experiencing this so sent me for host of blood tests

https://imgur.com/gallery/15r6wvR

For which here are the results^

After my results I was referred by my GP to go to a&e that night where I had further blood tests. They told me my liver enzymes were raised which I now know is due to nafld and that my CBC was off and they were referring me to haematologist. 

3 days later I was referred to SDEC ( same day emergency care) at the hospital where they retook my bloods. I was told something along the lines of levels gone done but liver enzymes still high( hence nafld) diagnosis. 

I have heard nothing so far from any hemotolgist. 

I’m just really scared, why would I be referred to heomotolgy if they didn’t suspect a blood cancer? I’m terrified, I’m so scared I might have cancer. I have since come down with conjunctivitis and a little bit of a cold, pain in my left side has gone and my lymph nodes do not appear to be swollen anymore but I’m still terrified. 

Could someone please shed some light on this for me please? I have another appt this coming Friday to review bloods again and to discuss results of liver ultrasound.

AskDocs,NAFLD,1h9xw0t,GI doctor opinion needed--two months of pancreatitis followed by...something else,"* Age: 53
* Sex: male
* Height: 6' 4""
* Weight: 155 (but normally 190)
* Race: Caucasian
* Duration of complaint: Approx 2-3 months
* Location (Geographic and on body): abdomen, general body
* I have celiac disease, and have been strictly gluten free since diagnosis in 2008.
* Current medications (if any): 145mg fenofibrate (to lower triglycerides); Constella (to address constipation and bloating).

Thanks in advance for any help someone can provide in some ideas.

My entire life, I've always had a poor diet (pizza, french fries, burgers many times a week, etc)--not exclusively, but mostly. I have sensory ARFID, which means I've never eaten fruits or vegetables and have a limited palate. I've also had very high triglycerides for a long time (between 4-8 mmol/L over many years). Aside from the fast food I actually avoid sugar as much as possible (I drink water).

All summer, my diet was even worse than ever if that's even possible. Then, starting in mid-August and lasting through most of September, I started noticing bowel changes, which ended up with me being almost completely constipated and producing hardly any stool at all. At the same time, I started feeling ""off""--just generally not well.

On September 25, an hour after eating a pizza, I suddenly had an ""attack"" in the gallbladder area--cramping that came and went. I also started feeling extremely unwell and faint. I was away on vacation, otherwise I would've gone to an emergency room. I thought I was having a gallbladder problem, so basically ate almost nothing the next three days.

Four days later I was home and went to my doctor immediately. Blood work showed high lipase levels (around 200). An ultrasound soon after showed everything normal. However my doctor suspected pancreatitis, which eventually was confirmed via CT scan on October 20 (diagnosis was ""mild focal pancreatitis""). Since I don't drink and no gallstones were found, he figured the pancreatitis was brought on by my high triglycerides.

Despite going on a super low-fat (and healthier) diet, my pancreatitis symptoms continued through early November. Finally, in desperation, I did a three-day liquid diet, and also started fenofibrate medication to lower my triglycerides. Immediately afterward, things started to improve. Eating almost normally (but still healthier and low-fat), I was feeling much better, stools were returning to normal, etc.

On November 28, I decided to ""treat myself"" for emerging from pancreatitis symptoms by eating a small bison burger with some air-fryer homemade french fries (no oil, just cut potatoes). Later, for dessert, I had a small chocolate ice cream sandwich.

The next day, I felt much worse again--generally unwell, nausea centered in the upper right quadrant, bloating and abdominal distension, constipation and almost no stool, etc. That continues to this day.

So, that's all the background. Here's the conundrum I'm trying to figure out: I did blood work on December 4. It showed my lipase level is now totally normal (45--it had been 197 on November 4). However, although my triglycerides are only slightly above normal (1.78 mmol/L, where 1.70 is the upper threshold for normal), my ferritin levels are elevated. Before this all started in August, my ferritin levels were around 200. Starting in early October after my initial ""attack"", they started rising, and have not come down since then--on December 4, my ferritin was 425.

so I'm trying to figure out why I still feel generally unwell and poor. I thought maybe gallbladder, but all scans have come back normal (even a HIDA scan showed normal except for a slightly high ejection fraction of 75%). My GP thinks it's likely IBS...but then why are the ferritin levels so high? My understanding is that the ferritin is an indicator of either infection (unlikely as far as I understand in my case), inflammation, or liver disease. I can totally understand possible fatty liver disease due to my longstanding poor diet--in fact, NAFLD symptoms of malaise, fatigue, and discomfort in upper right abdomen matches my symptoms very closely.

Thanks very much for taking the time to reply, I appreciate it.

I think I mentioned in my post that the pancreatitis was confirmed via abdominal CT scan with contrast--the scan report read as follows:

""The head and uncinate process of the pancreas are mildly enlarged and heterogeneous. There is surrounding fat stranding with no discrete mass or ductal dilatation identified. No peripancreatic fluid collection. The findings are most in keeping with mild focal pancreatitis. The adjacent vasculature is patent.""

Then in the summary of observations, the report read:

""Bulky and heterogeneous head and uncinate process of the pancreas with minor surrounding stranding, in keeping with focal pancreatitis. Followup CT or MRI assessment after resolution of symptoms is recommended to further exclude an occult mass.""

The CT scan was ordered because the lipase levels had peaked at just over 3x what my lab considers the upper limit of normal, and I was suffering pancreatitis symptoms such as pain in my abdomen and back, bloating, etc. The levels were at 282, and my lab considers normal 80. Also, when I went to the ER on October 24 because I was having nausea and discomfort, the ER GI doctor on call said ""yes, I looked at your CT scan, you definitely have pancreatitis."" (For what it's worth, at that time, they gave me two bags of IV saline and then sent me home.)

In the end, from the time of my acute ""attack"" on September 25, it seems to have taken about 1.5-2 months for the lipase to return to normal levels.

I thought all along that it was my gallbladder, not pancreas, because when I had my ""attack"", it felt like my gallbladder was cramping. However, an initial abdominal ultrasound and the later CT scan showed nothing unusual with the gallbladder; and a HIDA scan I did the other day found nothing abnormal either (although it did say my ejection fraction, though within normal limits, was 75--which I understand is right about at the upper limit of what would be considered normal). My doctors explained this all away by saying that an inflamed head of a pancreas is right next to the gallbladder and can cause pain in that general area.",1.0

Sorry, maybe I'm not being clear. I'm still not feeling great, even though the pancreatitis now seems to be gone (lipase is normal). The symptoms I'm having match the symptoms I had before what seems to have been the acute pancreatitis attack at the end of September. Namely, I'm fatigued, have malaise, generally feel unwell, and every now and then have a nausea pang and discomfort in the upper right abdomen. I also have severe abdominal distension--I look pregnant--in addition to severe constipation. As I wrote:

> so I'm trying to figure out why I still feel generally unwell and poor. I thought maybe gallbladder, but all scans have come back normal (even a HIDA scan showed normal except for a slightly high ejection fraction of 75%). My GP thinks it's likely IBS...but then why are the ferritin levels so high? My understanding is that the ferritin is an indicator of either infection (unlikely as far as I understand in my case), inflammation, or liver disease. I can totally understand possible fatty liver disease due to my longstanding poor diet--in fact, NAFLD symptoms of malaise, fatigue, and discomfort in upper right abdomen matches my symptoms very closely. But, if that were the case, why would I have been basically feeling ""okay"" in mid-November?

My guess is that something related to my poor diet/high triglycerides caused not just pancreatitis, but also this underlying other GI problem I'm still struggling with. This problem continues despite the fact I haven't eaten the same poor diet for over two months now--still no fruits or vegetables due to my ARFID (which I'm going to work on for sure), but I've been eating fish and chicken for protein (no red meat), chia and sesame seeds, brown rice and white rice, gluten free bread with psyllium husk (so relatively high fibre), etc.

So bottom line, I'm trying to figure out what's causing my continuing symptoms and what's causing the ferritin to continue to be high.",1.0

Your ferritin levels could just be elevated due to ingesting access iron. Any kind of inflammation will also raise your ferritin levels but there's nothing obviously here (data/information wise) that correlates with why your ferritin levels could be elevated (IF it's from an inflammatory cause). Your diet certainly points toward a high-iron intake. Fatty liver could potentially raise your ferritin too. Again, we don't use ferritin and try to work backwards to figure out what's causing it. That's generally not how it works since it's just a ""symptom"" of a billion different inflammatory causes.

The issue I think is that my ferritin levels, up until October when this all started, were all quite normal and stable. I don't see how I would suddenly have excess iron based on my new recent diet of fish/chicken/GF pasta/brown rice/carbs/etc, and I have celiac disease and have had low iron in the past; excess iron seems unlikely. So that leaves the main potential high ferritin causes as infection (almost certainly not the case here), inflammation, and fatty liver disease. If it's inflammation (which is certainly possible), then my question is: What's inflamed, and could whatever it is be causing my current continuing symptoms beyond the supposedly-now-healed pancreatitis (is it perhaps my gallbladder, perhaps, given that the ejection fraction on the HIDA scan I took was 75, which is right at the upper limit of normal)? If it's fatty liver disease (also certainly possible), then it'd be good to know that too, because the diet for hopefully reversing fatty liver disease seems to be somewhat different from, say, a diet to address IBS.",1.0

AskDocs,NAFLD,1gkptwe,I'm having severe neuro symptoms and the doctors so far can't figure it out. Anyone?,"38m, white, 215 lbs, 5'7""
I'm having severe neuro symptoms and no one can figure out why. Please help.

So this started about two months ago. I had a sudden loss of vision, that I didn't even realize had happened. 
-My vision went from 20/10 in both eyes to 20/80 in my right (dominant) and 20/40 in my left. 

-I'm constantly itching in my feet and limbs. 
If I'm upright and moving for more than half an hour I get dizzy and I feel faint, and occasionally my legs will literally just give out. 

-I've also started misreading letters and numbers. 
-memory loss in general 

-severe insomnia 

- a feeling like my eyes are vibrating in my head, usually accompanied by weird feeling like my head doesn't fit properly, I don't know how to explain it better.

My head will start to list to the side now if I don't consciously remember to keep it upright.

-And to finish out, I've lost my muscle memory.
 Playing video games I've played for years, painting, typing, driving. The natural reflexes just aren't there anymore and I have to consciously think about every movement. 

Known and previously diagnosed medical issues are as follows:
-Borderline personality disorder 
- anxiety 
- NAFLD
- rheumatiod arthritis 
- psoriasis 

Other traumatic injuries, and I'm not exaggerating or making these up: 
-Lighting struck at 16 and 22
-Severe injuries from an auto accident at 27 (broken bones, no head trauma)
- snake bit at 25, 30, 33  twice by copperheads and once by a pigmy rattlesnake 
- heatstrokes and heat exhaustion at 33, and 36

Background on me: former land surveyor tech, former high risk private security officer (body guard) and currently a private investigator specializing in medical claims fraud, for those that know the details I do (did until these issues started) both surveillance and SIU. So prior to the symptoms starting I would've been considered to be off relatively sound body and mind.

So far I've seen an optometrist, an optomologist, and a neuro optomologist. The first was useless. The second thinks I had a TIA, and the 3rd couldn't be bothered to actually look into my case and referred me to get an MRI and see a neurologist (in my area there's a shortage of neurologist and its going to be a while before I get into see one)
At the start of this I did go to the ER and when they did a non contrast MRI they didn't see anything. 
I'm pretty desperate as my left eye is getting worse and I basically can't work anymore, and I can barely function. If anyone has any advise I'd greatly appreciate it.

It’s excellent that you’re keeping your health data organized, too!

A few pieces of additional info would be helpful. 

1. Are any of these medications new, or have the dosages been changed recently? If so, what what was the timing between the changes and your symptoms - and these labs? 
2. Can you say more about your weakness and exhaustion? These are both complicated symptoms that can mean very different things. For example, are certain muscles weaker than others, or does your whole body feel weak? Are you weak all the time or just certain times of day? Similarly with exhaustion, when do you notice this the most (e.g., when getting up in the morning, walking up hills, etc.)? Do you feel short of breath? Any other associated symptoms? 
3. Are you monitoring your heart rate or blood pressure at home, especially when you're feeling most weak/exhausted? If not, you might want to consider it, as this info may be helpful for your doctors.

**Lab findings/infections**

I’m not a rheumatologist, but I suspect your symptoms and the lab findings could be due to your condition or, more likely, your medications. Plaquenil has a number of potential side effects, muscle weakness being one of them, and is known to lower immunoglobulin levels (so does sulfasalazine), which is one way it helps people with autoimmune conditions. One of the known risks of medications used to dampen the immune system is increased susceptibility to infections.

**Weakness/exhaustion**

Many of your meds have weakness as a known side effect. For example, cevimeline can make people feel weak. Metoprolol can cause fatigue in some people, especially when it's first started. Perhaps more importantly, **many of your medications interact with each other - there are too many interaction for me to list**, but I recommend using a tool like Epocrates (https://apps.apple.com/us/app/epocrates/id281935788)  to check for yourself and discuss with your rheumatologist AND primary care provider. Also, given your weight gain, it may be worth getting screened for sleep apnea, which can cause fatigue/exhaustion. 

I hope some of this is helpful for you and that you're able to get to the bottom of these new symptoms soon.",3.0

The interactions suck but honestly we've done a lot of tweaking over the years to get the ones with the least interactions. It's a pain! At least I don't experience many physical side effects (like GI issues, etc) from them. 

1. Plaquenil I've been on since 2016, metoporol since about 2018, enbrel I started this year (January/February - switched from orencia, another biologic). Everything else I've been on at least a few years - long before any of the new symptoms started. 

2. Weakness - it's most notable in my legs. I used to be an athlete and now I can't even stand up without pushing myself up. My rheumy asked me to stand up without my arms and I couldn't do it. I also have some in my arms where it's harder to pick things up than it used to be, but mostly the legs. This started probably around April of this year and got really noticeable sometime over the summer when I could barely swim with my kid (I used to swim competitively). 

Exhaustion - I'm just always tired. I've always had fatigue but it got a lot better after I started treatments in 2016. Now for the last several months it's like I can do work for a few hours and then I HAVE to nap or I'm not functional.

I'd never thought about my medications causing these because I've been monitored and stable for so long, but that's definitely something I can forward to a pharmacist friend of mine to look at specifically (he's well acquainted with my medical history and has expressed concern more than once about how many meds I'm on 😅)",1.0

NOW for the story -->

It all started back in April of 2023. I was on Trulicity for my diabetes. I was fine for a while and then I went up a dose from the lowest dose. A week later, I began having extremely bad abdominal pain for days on end. I went to the ER to find out I had pancreatitis. It wasn't severe, quite mild and no need for a hospital stay. Moving on, I continued to be in and out of the hospital because of the abdominal pain however I kept being told I had a colonic back up even though I was having bowel movements very normally, nothing had changed. At that time, my lipase numbers seemed to be fine. I went back one last time due to abdominal pain and my lipase numbers were high. Again, they didnt keep me so I went home for self care. A few days later, I ended up having a random situation where I was eating dinner and began to have extremely bad vertigo, slurring my words and had a syncope episode. Upon going to the hospital, no one knew why I had the episode and told me to see my PCP. She couldn't explain it either but decided to send me to a GI doctor.

Before seeing the GI doctor, I began to have changes in my bowel movements. I would have days of constipation followed by days of diarrhea. I would have tenesmus and have bad random nausea (mostly upon waking in the morning). Continuing on, I saw the GI doctor who stated that my pain is most likely my small bowel. I stated okay, they got me on the books for a colonoscopy and an endoscopy. No IBD, no gastritis, no inflammation. Only benign lymphoid aggregates in the terminal ileum. Started me on Mesalamine to see if it would help with my issues. Needless to say, it did not. \*i forgot to mention that my abdominal pain was located to the left of my umbilical, nothing upper at this time\*

I continued to have worsening symptoms of abdominal pain that would place me in the ER, with diarrhea, constipation(no blood in stool this entire time btw), nausea and just not feeling well. They did blood work and determined I had iron deficiency without anemia and a positive AMCA. They immediately jumped to Crohn's even though I had no proof via colonoscopy. Stated to continue on Mesalamine and it would get better. Well, it did not.. Everything continued to persist and I changed doctors. During this time, I began having a random rash that started on my neck and spread to my arms. Biopsied and came back as interface dermatitis due to a illness or connective tissue disorder. They also did blood work. ANA negative, thyroid was askew however, C3 elevated, EBV elevated but no one was concerned at all. I went to an endo who diagnosed me with subacute thyroiditis when all of this was occurring.. was on propranolol and it went away. Thyroid is back to normal with no other issues.

Moving on.. My new GI wanted me to get a CT enterography of my abdomen which showed no evidence of IBD and the appearance of my small intestine looked fine. Did a breath test..came back fine. Tried Xifaxan, Dicyclomine and Zenpep. Nothing helped. Did a fibroscan, showed NAFLD. Did a HIDA because we had no idea where to go next. The HIDA showed low ejection fraction and biliary dyskinesia. Since we didn't know where to go next, we removed the gallbladder in 12/2023. At the same time, I began to have a new rash on my back. Biopsied and dx with pityriasis rosea. Was told it would go away in a few weeks (its now 9 10 months later and i still have it). Moving on..

Tried to give it time to see if things would settle but it did not. Same symptoms from my abdomen but now it is painful in my umbilical area AND upper right quadrant pain below my ribs. Nausea worsened, and now extreme fatigue was kicking in. In 2/2024, they did a CT of my abdomen with contrast and notated that I have no acute findings, and I have a 9 mm hepatic hypodensity too small to characterize. Further testing (MRI) showed it was a benign hemangioma. I also have hepatomegaly with diffuse hepatic steatosis. Nothing else further there.

I did begin having bad body aches, random muscle aches (like middle of my limb and would go away in a few hours), joint pain, extreme fatigue, palpitations and random nausea, continuing the same abdominal issues(and yes i finally started a probiotic).

Now we are summer of this year. I changed PCPs who put me on Cymbalta for anxiety and the random muscle aches that started this year. It did help a little for muscle pain but not much. But they referred me to a rheumatologist, cardiologist and sleep specialist. I have mild apnea. One rheum told me fibromyalgia without further testing, another said it is a huge coincidence and nothing is related and I am fine. And the new one stated that theyre starting me on hydroxychloroquine to see if it helps my symptoms since my symptoms are real.

I am seeing a pain specialist whom did an upper and lower EMG. I have cubital tunnel on my right arm and peripheral neuropathy on my lower limbs. My A1C is stellar and has been for years. I was dx with diabetes in 2020 and got my A1C down to below 7 for the past 4.5 years. LABS --> High CRP and ESR rate for the past year. Iron deficiency is fixed. Factor 8 is elevated. I have had almost every lab test done that anyone can think of from autoimmune hepatitis, to valley fever. If you are wondering if they did xyz test... ask! I have too many screenshots of results to share but will if needed.

My current symptoms include --> fatigue, body aches, joint pain, muscle pain, random headaches, nausea, diarrhea followed by constipation(no i dont take constipation meds or diarrhea meds ever), i feel weak sometimes, palpitations, inner ear pain, somewhat pitted or messed up nails, i get cold REALLY fast(i usually live in 68 degree weather but at night i am freezing in 72 degrees)... and im just exhausted with everything. Please help, the other symptoms didnt start until this year... I also have always had a high HR. Typically around 100 resting for the past like 8 years it seems like lol.

No significant family history that I am aware of besides my mother passing away at 34 with sarcoma cancer that metastasized to the lungs, maternal grandma with breast cancer, maternal half aunt with cervical cancer, and maternal great uncle with prostate cancer.

AskDocs,NAFLD,1flgf4a,Mildly Elevated AST/ALT Liver Enzymes - Health Anxiety,"51M, 5'11"", 230lbs, White, USA

Primary Complaint: Elevated AST/ALT enzymes

Don't smoke, drink, or do drugs.

First, let me state that I have severe health anxiety and am on Escitalopram to deal with GAD.  I also take a statin for high cholesterol.  I went in for my annual physical and while all of my results came back normal across all tests (Metabolic, Lipid, Thyroid, PSA, A1C, and CBC) and I have had two normal urine tests in the last month, my AST and ALT numbers were ""mildly elevated"".

From a historical perspective in August of 2023, my AST was 37 and the ALT was 60.  In August of 2024 the numbers jumped up to 46 and 74 respectively.  I am a terrible hydrator, typically drinking around 20 - 30 ounces of water daily.  My primary care doctor indicated I should start drinking 64 - 96 ounces of water a day, which I did.  About a week ago I did a Hepatic Function Panel and all numbers continued to be normal, except for the enzymes.  The numbers went down to 44 and 68, but are still elevated.

My doctor thinks this is NAFLD and wants me to have an ultrasound to make that determination concrete.  The next step would be to lose weight, which has gone up over the last few years.

With severe health anxiety, my mind has spun into liver cancer.  So, I'm looking for a ""second opinion"" on this matter.  Are these numbers concerning?  With a pretty subpar diet and little to know exercise is NAFLD the likely cause?  Is there anything in your experience that leads you to a conclusion of liver cancer?

Thanks in advance for your insights.",3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1flgf4a/mildly_elevated_astalt_liver_enzymes_health/,ZenCardinal777,2024-09-20 09:38:33,4.0,post,,,

Medications: Mounjaro 15 mg. First started medication 12/2023, have slowly titrated up. I have lost approximately 65 pounds since starting. Not a smoker or drinker. Diagnoses: Type 2 diabetes, NAFLD but recent liver levels are normal after weight loss. 

For the past year or so, I would wake up once a month or every other month with a sore throat. I always contributed this to sleeping with a fan a few feet from me. It would last 24 hours and go away.

The last couple of months this has become more frequent and is accompanied by a mild cough, and flu like symptoms. I don't know how else to describe it but I feel super hot (never actually run a fever), and like shit, sometimes with a nasal drip.

This has happened the last 3 weekends in a row, it will start mid day and by night time I feel truly awful. Most of the time I wake up the next day back to normal.

At first my doctor said it was probably acid reflux because it was just a sore throat, but now I don't know.

Recent bloodwork is all normal aside from APA which came back positive (picture in comments) but my doctor wasn't concerned due to normal sed rate and CRP levels.",6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1flos3n/frequent_flu_like_symptoms/,beckywiththegood1,2024-09-20 15:47:37,7.0,post,,,

AskDocs,NAFLD,1ecot91,High MPV level,"F36yo, live in the UK.
I was diagnosed with NAFLD 4 months ago and recommendation from my GP was to lose weight (233lbs at the time) and exercise (very sedentary too). 

I lost almost 40lbs since with the help of Mounjaro. Only mild side effects so far. I usually eat around 1,200-1,400 cals per day.

I also started exercising, I do 1 hour walking/running 5x a week + strength exercises.

Had to re-do my blood tests to check if my liver was doing better and all good! Didn’t see the doctor yet but I think I don’t have NAFLD anymore. Also my cholesterol was a bit high before and now it is in the normal range.

HOWEVER, newest test showed that my MPV increased and it is now out of range (12.7fl) and my platelets went down -45 10*9L, but still in the normal range (248).

All other measures are normal.

My questions are:

What does that mean?
Should I be worried?

Not sure if Mounjaro and/or the weight loss and/or excess exercise could impact MPV???

I will see my GP in two weeks to discuss this, but I’m a bit anxious… 😬

AskDocs,NAFLD,1eb4ulk,First meeting doctor tells me to get bariatric surgery?,"32M, Singapore. I went to an endocrinologist recently for a first appointment because I'm trying to lose weight for controlling NAFLD. This was all at a public hospital and doctor, not private. I weigh 123kg and am 172cm tall. 

I told them that I had already been on a slight change of diet and exercise that lost me 10kg, but plateaued over the past 4 months. I'm okay with medication but not fond of meal replacements, because of cost and mental health issues. Currently on antidepressants. Also cool with making a little more lifestyle changes. No alcohol, drugs, or tobacco. 

They went through all the usual slides for weight loss and options, diet, exercise, medication, surgery, etc. And immediately after they covered that, they instantly suggested bariatric surgery, completely skipping everything else. 

Honestly, I thought they would go through other steps first? I haven't even been given a DEXA, RMR test, or proper BIA (they mis-measured my height by 2cm), so I don't even know where I stand in terms of mass and density. Maybe even measure my hormone levels to see if I'm deficit. But that's also a no? 

And depending on which BMI equation are used (which I recently found to be very unreliable, especially for a southeast Asian) I'm anywhere between 30 to 40 BMI. So either I have just a little more to go to get things under control, or I'm about to have a heart attack? Aside from my NAFLD (which I haven't even had an elastography for yet), and high blood pressure which is under control with medication, I'm otherwise fine. 

Is this a normal train of progression for obesity treatment from an endocrinologist? Because of my experience with weight bias in doctors, it took me 4 long years to even get to the specialist level, so I'm wondering if I just have my guards up? I'm very used to GPs suggesting extreme treatment to ""scare me thin"", but I didn't expect it from a specialist.

AskDocs,NAFLD,1eb4ulk,First meeting doctor tells me to get bariatric surgery?,,,,MyDoctorFriend,2024-07-24 09:58:03,,comment,leqgn14,"Hello, the treatment and evaluation of obesity is a subject that is vast for which thousands of articles and books have been written, many of which offer confounding prescriptions for diet, behavior, medications, and, as a physician has suggested, surgery.  I can offer the following:

1.  We define severe obesity when a person's BMI is greater than 40 kg/m2 (the body mass index is your weight in kilos divided by your height in meters squared).  Your BMI is 41.6.  Severe obesity carries many risks including high blood pressure, increased risk for diabetes, fatty liver (which you have and which is often associated with insulin resistance), heart disease, stroke,  and even cancer.  It also has a profound influence on our sense of well being and the perception of our self worth.

2.  Losing weight is very, very hard to do.  Our genetic proclivities, our upbringing, our cultural mores all contribute to our manner of eating.  Comprehensive lifestyle changes- diet, exercise, changes in our behavior rarely are able to achieve long lasting weight reduction.  While this doesn't mean that some individuals can succeed by these more conservative approaches, most are unable to do so.  

3.  Medications can be used to aid an individual in losing weight.  The most effective medications now available are GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide 1) receptor agonists.  While expensive, they have the least side effects and have resulted in sustained weight reductions.  Other medications are available but their side effects often limit their usage.

4.  Sometimes doctors recommend the placement of devices in the stomach such as balloons to lessen an individual's hunger.  I don't recommend these approaches.

5.  Bariatric surgery has proven to be very effective for sustained and significant weight reduction in persons who are severely overweight.  In the hands of an experienced surgeon, the risks are small (there is no such thing as ""simple"" surgery and every procedure carries with it some risk) but the benefits of losing weight are amazing.  In my experience, those individuals who have undergone this procedure have been thrilled with the results:  drops in blood pressure, reductions in cholesterol and triglycerides, lowered risks for diabetes and fatty liver, improved energy and better sleep (individuals who are severely obese have an increased risk of sleep apnea), and a much greater sense of well being.

All of these comments assume (a dangerous word) that you do not have any 'medical' issues that predispose you to weight gain such as an under-active thyroid.

You are a young man who should strive to do all you can to assure a long and healthy life ahead.  No doctor can tell you what to do nor can he/she understand your specific circumstances, motivations, fears, and aspirations.  I would ask you, however, whether you believe that you can alter your lifestyle in so radical a manner as to achieve weight reduction that is meaningful and long lasting.  If so, certainly try.  But if you honestly recognize that such changes are near impossible, do not be afraid to accept therapeutic options such as bariatric surgery  to help you- with a high likelihood of success- achieve your desired goals.  I hope that this note is helpful and wish you the best of luck.",25.0

*Diagnosed with NAFLD in 2023

Hi! I've been on ozempic for 9 weeks and my physician ordered a routine metabolic panel, mainly to check my kidney function. My aspartate amino trans was flagged high at 32 u/l after being only 17 four months ago. My alanine amino trans was also flagged as high at 35 u/l after being 29 four months ago. (Four months ago I had another metabolic panel for my annual physical so that's what I'm comparing it to)

I did go to urgent care a couple days ago because my urine output was low and my urine was dark/cloudy/bubbly, turns out I'm just dehydrated (hard to drink when you feel full all the time), no protein or bacteria in urine so it looks like my kidneys are fine but can dehydration cause elevated liver enzymes? Looking at my medical records, in 2021 my alanine level was actually up to 40 u/l but my physician at the time didn't mention say anything, it was during an abdominal ultrasound for something unrelated in 2023 that they happened to notice my liver was enlarged etc and I was diagnosed with NAFLD.

Is this anything to be concerned about? I have a follow-up in a couple weeks with the physician managing my weight loss who ordered the panel. My GP said we could wait until next year's physical to do another liver ultrasound to monitor since I'm working on losing weight but should I schedule a follow-up sooner since my levels are elevated?

Anyways, my LFT were elevated the past year at every doctor's visit.

Ultrasound results came back as ""fatty filtration of the liver"". I don't drink, so this would have had to have been NAFLD if anything. I was referred to a hepatologist who ran a bunch of tests for things like autoimmune hepatitis, cholangitis, etc. pretty much every autoimmune test for liver disease that exists as well as Hep A, B, and C and Celiac's. All was negative. I asked her then if this was just a simple cause of NAFLD and she told me no, that I do not have fatty liver because my age and weight basically made that impossible and my LFTs were not consistent with fatty liver. She recommended a one year follow-up ultrasound, but said she did not think I had it.

Your LFTs are basically normal or *extremely, mildly elevated*…seriously, even LFTs in the 100s are still low.  50s are nothing in the grand scheme of things in terms of health or liver damage.


So it’s more academic question of whether there’s fatty infiltration of the liver.  Radiologist thought there was.  Gastroenterologist thought not.

Hello! 

30 y/o, male, 5’10” and ~250lbs, no meds, non smoker, rare social drinker (1-2x/yr), only medical problem is NAFLD. Most recent labs show not diabetic, no cholesterol issues, no BP problems. Working on weight loss but not sure if relevant to complaint in this post. 

My husband has really bad dandruff and has picked scabs off his scalp before. Today he picked a lump off and we're not sure what it is?

He says it doesn't hurt at all (but may feel differently at his next shower). There is a crater on his scalp that I put neosporin on, although he has short prickly hair so his hair fibers won't flatten enough to apply the cream well enough.

The thing (lesion? growth?) he pulled off is white and smooth, has the firmness of a gummy bear. It's not hard like tooth but also not soft like a marshmallow. It's about 6-7mm long. We tried pinching it without bursting it and it feels very dense.

Current Medical History: non-severe idiopathic gastroparesis, chronic abdominal pain with visceral hypersensitivity, chronic idiopathic constipation (bowel movements once every 10-16 days or longer), poorly controlled blood sugars, seizure disorder, trimmer, elevated prolactin levels (not pregnant or lactating), elevated liver numbers, benign mass next to heart, liver perfusion abnormality.

Current Meds: Keppra (seizure prevention), pepcid, L. gasseri, hydroxyzine (for allergies/sleep), NJ tube w/ pump, docusate liquid, vitamin B complex, Vitamin D, Cod Liver Oil, Magnesium, Potassium, Biotin.


I've posted here before about other things so if you recognize some of this, hi again!
Long story short: I began having post-prandial abdominal pain, early satiety, nausea, lightheadedness, extreme blood sugar fluctuations and seizures at around the same time. I was super fatigued and became very weak. My hair fell out in clumps so now I have bald spots. My appetite completely went away and my tolerance for solid foods disappeared over time. I  was at the point where I could barely stomach 1 supplemental drink per day. I ended up losing over 70lbs in 6 months, then had an NJ tube placed to prevent further weightloss but ended up losing an additional 30-40lbs. At that time my caloric intake was about 1900 calories per day. Over the last 18 months I have increased my caloric intake to around 3000 calories per day, with no weight increases (give or take fluctuations of 1-3lbs around menstruation). Recently, a nutritionist suggested supplementing more calories with MCT oil or Olive Oil. I started with olive oil at 2-3 tablespoons per day for one week, then MCT oil at the same amount until I reached about 5 tablespoons per day. This brought my caloric intake up to around 3400+ calories per day for a month straight. Instead of gaining weight, I lost 10lbs this month.

None of my docs can figure out why or know what to test for. I'm already a medical mystery because my chronic abdominal pain doesn't respond to medication of any drug class or therapies and there is no visible damage there. Does anyone have a clue what my docs could test for? 


Previous tests (negative): VGKC pathologies, NAFLD, gallbladder/liver function, porphyria, hepatitis array, sarcoidosis, cystic fibrosis, sickle cell anemia, biopsies of several lymph nodes, thyroid biopsy, duodenal biopsy, gastric biopsy, esophageal biopsy, amyloidosis, clear MRI, clear echocardiogram with bubble test, superior mesenteric artery syndrome, Lyme disease, lupus, rheumatological pathologies, mitochondrial diseases, periodic paralysis


I was very healthy prior to this; a vegetarian for nearly 15 years, ate whole, well rounded meals with macro management. Yes I was well over 200lbs, but I was training to be a competitive power lifter, moving hundreds of pounds 5x a week with yoga and cardio and still reaching PRs even after losing the first 20lbs.

Prior to starting levo, my cycles were always regular—only variations occurred after a severe viral illness (such as COVID or a stomach bug), and were only \~6 days, not 15. So, my pcp decided to test for TSH/T4/T3 (*TSH elevated at 4.2, meaning I need more levo (expected)*), alongside some general hormone tests (total testosterone, FSH, LH, etc), which all came back completely normal—except for the DHEA.

The DHEA result was over 1400 ng/dL, with the reference ranges were 31-701 ng/dL. I have absolutely no idea why they are so high.

I don't believe I have PCOS, as an abdominal CT scan in the ER in January (due to severe stomach virus) showed a ""1.6 cm physiological corpus lutem"" (*aka a functional cyst lol*), and no other evidence of PCOS—plus, my blood tests were perfect. Also, I don't show any signs of Insulin Resistance—my glucose levels are always perfect + I keep a very strict eye on it due to a large family history of Type 2 Diabetes (*I'm sure it'll develop eventually, just not in my 20s*). 

The CT scan also showed no issues with my adrenal glands, so I really have no idea what could be happening. 

**Known issues**:

Seronegative Hashimoto's, causing primary subclinical hypothyroidism (*in treatment with levothyroxine*)

NAFLD (*seen on CT scan in January, liver enzymes tested 100% normal :), likely related to hypothyroidism*)

Obesity (*primarily related to the hypothyroidism*)

High Cholesterol (*likely related to the hypothyroidism, not on statins*)

I don't smoke (*anything*) or consume alcohol.

My main questions are:

1. ...What on earth could be causing this (especially if not PCOS related)?
2. What should I ask my doctors for/about? (blood tests, ultrasounds, etc.)

I'm sorry if this is a lot—I'm just so freaked out, and a lot of information out there is about DHEA-S, not DHEA. My primary care provider is out until Monday and my endocrinologist is not the best with responding to my messages (*which is completely understandable! She is a very busy person! :)*), so I just don't really know what to make of this.

Thank you all so much! I hope everyone has a wonderful day/week! Thank you in advance for any advice you can give in this situation!",3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1bou05t/extremely_high_dhea_nonpcos_what_to_ask_my/,sad_substituteIL1234,2024-03-26 22:12:32,1.0,post,,,

What is happening? Does this mean these levels are not related to alcohol? Can levels be this high in something like NAFLD? And why are they increasing so fast?

28.
225lbs.
5’10.

Relatively healthy with no known health conditions or issues - just overweight and I know I need to work on this. I gained about 30lbs over the course of 6-8 months. Moderately active - but no hard physical activity in the past few months. I don’t drink and don’t smoke/no drugs. 

I take a multivitamin, Fish Oil, Vitamin D, Lexapro (anxiety/depression), and an allergy pill daily. 

I recently had my yearly physical and routine bloodwork - came back with slightly elevated AST and ALT levels - 

3/08/24- 
AST: 50
ALT: 128
Total Bilirubin: 1.3 

Doctor ordered another round of tests but with CK and GGT added in there. My grandmother had ALS and my parents/doctor recommended adding it.

3/12/24- 
AST: 60
ALT: 139
CK: 94
GGT: 38
Total Bilirubin: 1.8

I’m thinking it possibly might be Fatty Liver Disease - but with the elevated CK numbers, I’m worrying an underlying muscle issue may be at play here? 

Doctor hasn’t reviewed results yet - but mentioned I will probably get a liver ultrasound to see what is going on as next steps. 

Wondering if this is common with NAFLD? Or might this be something more serious? I have no symptoms of any kind.

Since the short answer is no - is it possible to have Gilbert’s Syndrome and fatty liver which is causing the spike? My levels were considered elevated in 2020 - but everything else was normal.

On Nov. 11th, 2020 - my bilirubin result was 1.5.
On Nov. 19th, 2020 - my bilirubin was 0.9. 
On March 8th, 2024 - my bilirubin at 1.3.
On March 12th, 2024 - my bilirubin is at 1.8.

In 2020 - AST and ALT levels were normal. (30s ALT, 20s AST). 

My GGT level and Alkaline Phosphatase are normal on recent bloodwork. 

Should I be at all concerned about my pancreas? I have no symptoms of PC or pancreatitis. I know a very broad question for my actual doctor, but after researching it’s making my medical anxiety a bit heightened.

AskDocs,NAFLD,1b1keey,"What is more accurate, ultrasound or CT?","I have NAFLD, and splenomegaly. I usually have routine ultrasounds every year to monitor things. Last ultrasound was June 2023, it said my spleen had gotten larger. To me this was weird as I had lost some weight (I'm still overweight but less so), I quit drinking completely over 3 years ago, quit smoking, I even went plant based 2 years ago. 

So he sent me to an internist and she ordered many tests including another ultrasound (haven't had it yet) and a full torso CT with contrast.

I just got CT results this morning. It says no splenomegaly, my spleen is 10.3 cm. It says my liver,  gallbladder, biliary ducts and pancreas are all normal. 

So I'm very confused. Does this mean I do NOT have an enlarged liver and spleen anymore? How is that possible that they healed since June? I actually have been having right upper flank discomfort, I assumed it was my liver. How can the CT scan say my liver is normal if I have NAFLD? Would a CT show fibrosis? Wouldn't it say if it was enlarged? Were my ultrasounds wrong? Is the CT wrong? 

Also it showed ""mild changes of mesenteric panniculitis"" and I have no idea what that means. And a ""benign diffusely calcified nodule is seen in the subpleural region of the right upper lobe"", what is that, how do they know its benign?? 

I don't get to see my doctor until mid April so I thought I'd ask here as I'm very confused how it could say normal liver and spleen when ive been told i have enlarged ones for like 15 years.

AskDocs,NAFLD,1amphvk,Help/advice/ideas appreciated,"Hi, 

I know it's hard to say its ptosis with a picture but I'm asking anyway! Could anyone tell me if this is ptosis or something else, or any of the medical names to read about that you see here.

 I have weird attacks? daily, where my eyes drop, weakness in face, neck and arms, air hungar/chest pressure, slurred slow speech and other times husky/throaty voice and fatigue. I look and sound intoxicated and have to sit down, if I don't I walk huddled over leaning and holding things to get to where I can sit, if not just on the floor. If I try to fight it, my neck/head spasms backwards.
I feel pressure in my occipital region and neck tightness.

 It's been happening for 6 years now. All symptoms are intermittent, happens less if I do nothing all day, happens more and more severe if I do anything, like cleaning, shopping for an hour etc.

I saw a neurologist 5 years ago who said FND, I've had no trauma and he did no tests( not even the hoover? test) and wouldnt watch my videos. I still do not believe it and it has gotten worse over the years. I am at the point I don't want to see them again, as I do not want them them to dismiss me with fnd again and leave me for another 5 years on antidepressants only. (Which have never done anything).

Other symptoms 

Muscle twitching at rest-all over but only thighs upwards, daily but not constant. Intermittent tremors-head,arms and legs, random days. Right leg thigh spasms/contractures/jerks, random days. Extreme pain in centre abdomen just below ribs and middle back- comes  in flares- could be my sliding hernia? 

(F38) 5'7, 60kg, no drugs, alcohol on special occasions only

Current diagnosis'

Gerd, hiatal hernia, pseudopolyps, bile acid in throat, duodenitis, fnd, extragenital lichen sclerosus, polygenic hypercholesteremia and some others.

Optician- just told me I have decompensating exophoria with intermittent ptosis. 

Current tests I'm waiting for

Manometry and ph 24 hr test, have to have prior to having hernia surgery because of my symptoms I have to have this before hernia/Gerd surgery they want me to have. 

Test results- abnormal

I've had an mri about 4 years ago, they only found bilateral basal ganglia calcification hemo sequence.
Plasma viscosity has been high at around 1.85mpas for around 5 years (6 out of 7 tests)
Alt and ggt high for a few years. Nafld for 2 years but cured itself apparently. All other bloods mostly normal. Private achr binding test 0.12-negative, musk negative.

I realise this is long and I'm sorry!
But any help would be great. Sort of need a push to go to the doctors again, so if you don't think it's psychosomatic and think you know what it may be, even better 🤣

AskDocs,NAFLD,18ie1hc,Medical Mystery need advice,"
I want to preface this post by pointing out that i am not relying on Reddit for medical advice. I already am a patient with several specialists and also have some appointments in the very near future. I left my last hospital stay with the actual ER physician puzzled herself. I am reaching out to see if anyone has any thoughts or suggestions on other labs that I can maybe request, questions I can ask, specialist I could maybe see, ideas on what may be going on, etc. I live in the US, but in a state that is lacking specialists and the ones we do have are overworked or not the best. I'm a 39yo female have never had any medical issues such as these before . That being said March 2023 I was in my kitchen when I started feeling like I was going to faint. I sat down for a minute then the nausea hit. I got up slowly to go lay down and once i got to the hallway I peed myself . I went to the bathroom and stood at the mirror and saw all the color leave my face . Last thing I remember is opening the door and calling for my wife and telling her I was going to pass out. Woke up on the floor with paramedics there. My wife told me I was dry heaving (which I do not remember) and it was lights out. I've never fainted or had this happen. I was taken to the ER where they did an EKG which showed up fine and blood work ( T Troponin which was elevated ) along with the standard cbc. I was taken for a CT scan and was told there was possible white matter but they weren't sure if I had a seizure. Was referred to a neurologist and cardiologist. Neurologist diagnosed me with migraines put me on meds and did an EEG which was normal. Cardiologist did a 4 day holter and an ultrasound which was normal. I was given an ultrasound of the abdomen and found that I have NAFLD(which I've had for years) but when the GI dr ran labs my liver functions are within range but my smooth muscle antibody and my titers are all high (1:160) , platelets, WBC , bilirubin( I do have Gilbert's syndrome as does everyone in my family) . After this episode everytime I stand up not matter the speed I get a flash of dizziness where I have to get my bearings, or I may start to walk and the flash of dizziness happens. My vision has started to get weird like if someone turned up the brightness ( this happens randomly even without the migraine) eye have been checked out no optic nerve damage. I was sent for a sleep study and was told I have mild sleep apnea and put on a cpap with 4 hr min usage . This machine intensifies my migraines. I've been experiencing the feeling of hot water dripping down my legs and head (which I've had for years but was told it's muscle fatigue) I get the feeling like I'm being poked by a needle and pins and needs in my legs hands and sometimes feet. My hands sometimes feel like I've had them in a freezer and run hot water on them itchy and burning. A recent issue with my pinky finger where it its tight and feels like a rubberband is tied tightly around it. If my thighs, and lower back are touched or rubbed even lightly the pain is excruciating. Fast-forward to Nov I was diagnosed with DVT in my left leg and placed on Eliquis. 2 weeks into the meds I sat up in bed one day and the whole room was spinning. It took about an hour total to get my self right so I can continue my day . I had noticed pain in my back shortly after starting the thinners but chocked it up to maybe a pulled muscle. I went to the ER because it is painful to breathe in , the cold air makes it hurt and it feels like menthol in my back . More tests were run and all clear but again my labs were off WBC platelets all elevated again ( my wife went through all my old labs from 2019 and found my WBC was always elevated but my platlets were elevated slightly in 2021 but have been constanly high since feb 2023 (all levels I speak of will be in photos ). The ER dr told me she had no idea what was going on and I was diagnosed with pain without cause but told me I should see a hematologist (they can't see me til Feb). The fatigue is real I have little energy but can't sleep at night. Sometimes I could be fine and all of a sudden my head feels floaty out of no where and I'm unable to concentrate. I have been forgetful alot and seem to space out at times. I catch myself stopping in the middle of a conversation because I can't find the words to say. I've never had COVID either so it can't be these long haul symptoms I've seen. I apologize for the long post hopefully I didn't forget anything thank you all for taking the time to read it.

AskDocs,NAFLD,18eqgsk,"Amlodipine flushing with bright red feet, can I ignore it or do I need to see a doctor?","30F, 185 lbs

Daily Medication: Altavera, Zenpep, Phentermine, Amlodipine Besylate 10mg, Pepcid, half of a women's multivitamin. 

As needed meds: Hydroxyzine (anxiety), Meclizine (motion sickness and vertigo).

Medical history: NAFLD, Raynaud's, PCOS, ADHD, previous surgical removal of ovarian teratoma, chronic GI issues with history of stomach ulcers (previous diagnoses of gastritis, GERD, IBS-D but ongoing Rx for pancreatic enzymes resolved majority of symptoms).  

Recently had a rheumatology consult for the Raynaud's. Nothing popped on the blood panel except for low potassium and a slightly elevated C-reactive protein.

Caught COVID for the first time with day zero on Nov 7th 2023. Am vaccinated, boosted, and started a course of Paxlovid on day two.  Discontinued use of Amlodipine during the course and resumed use of Amlodipine after it was done.

Concern/question:
My feet have literally never been this red before. I've been on Amlodipine since summer 2023. My dose was adjusted from 5mg to 10mg once winter weather hit because gloves and thick socks weren't cutting it.  

First picture shows my feet after 10 minutes of standing. Second picture shows 5mg dose and third picture show Raynaud's when it was untreated.

Is the Amlodipine flush a problem? If it's not a dangerous side effect I'd prefer to stay on the Amlodipine.",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/18eqgsk/amlodipine_flushing_with_bright_red_feet_can_i/,jellybeansean3648,2023-12-09 15:50:03,1.0,post,,,

AskDocs,NAFLD,181jkdt,Diagnosed with Stage 2 Fibrosis of the Liver,"I \[31M\], 5'8, 145lbs, White, have been told I have stage 2 fibrosis of the liver. Doctor says healthy lifestyle is the only treatment. I've been alcohol free for 4 months, I do not smoke, vape, or take any drugs. I only drink on occasions yet my LFTs are always elevated after an episode of any alcohol. They slowly go back down over time.

The liver doc said the following: ""Thank you for completing the ultrasound elastography.  
This shows a normal anatomic appearing liver with stage II fibrosis/scarring of the liver. This indicates moderate scarring. Recall you had an extensive laboratory evaluation that was negative for other causes of underlying liver disease. Please continue to abstain from alcohol use.""  


If any other Liver specialists could review the attached test results and elaborate that would be great. Doc seems to think it's not too serious and can be reversed with diet/exercise (which I've been doing for awhile now). I haven't drank alcohol in 4 months. Doc also said ""it could be Mild to Moderate (stage 1 or 2) depending on NAFLD or AFLD

To provide some history: I've had history of elevated LFTs. Usually from bouts of binge drinking although I never have drank often. Just when I do, I typically drink a lot.

I'm pretty shocked by these results. Any insight would be helpful as all I ever hear is ""diet and exercise, let's retest in a few months.""

Your past binge drinking has been enough to raise LFTs. Those measure enzymes that should be inside liver cells and spill out when liver is damaged. *You drank to the point of damaging your liver repeatedly*. Not everyone and every liver is equally sensitive. Some people somehow drink like fish and are fine. Some drink only a little bit of excess and develop liver failure. I have been part of transplanting multiple people in their 30’s who no one thought of as alcoholics, but they drank too much, too often, and developed end stage liver disease.

Given the lack of other obvious cause, and depending on other workup, alcohol is the apparent cause. A hepatologist might want a biopsy and further testing for more detailed assessment of other things that might contribute to susceptibility, but it’s entirely possible for it all to be binge drinking.

That does not make it okay just because a lot of other people do it. 

It *does not* matter what your ex or friends drank. You need to quit drinking alcohol. If you chose not to, you bear the risk of developing liver cirrhosis, which is **not reversible**. You are 31. You should not have Stage II hepatic fibrosis.

Everyone responds to alcohol differently. Some can drink heavily for years and not have any issues. Your case is much different.

If you want this issue to reverse, you must quit drinking alcohol, eat a *super* healthy diet, and exercise (daily if you can). Even if this was not caused by alcohol, one drop of alcohol can be *detrimental* to your liver health at this point.

Again, you have every right to refuse medical advice, but I would strongly encourage you to not take a sip of alcohol despite being conscious of your alcohol intake.

>I would think all of Germany would have cirrhosis if the amount I drank was really that harmful.

Again, everyone processes alcohol differently. In your case, you cannot consume alcohol with the state of your liver health. Right now you have Stage 2 Fibrosis. Stage 3 is cirrhosis, so you are quite close. Liver cirrhosis is *not* reversible.

Your doctor is right. At this point, you *must* maintain a strict, healthy lifestyle or you risk liver cirrhosis.

You also have the right to call your doctor and inform him that you have been eating healthy. He or she will likely ask you about alcohol intake and tell you to quit. I get it. It's confusing, so calling your doctor may provide you with more answers.",6.0
AskDocs,NAFLD,17yc09d,Anxious About Elevated ALT,"Hi all,

Just want my nerves calmed a bit. I just got some follow up blood work done. I get blood work every year or so as I am on HCG monotherapy for hypogonadism. About a month ago, I got my annual blood work done and all of my liver values - ALT, AST, bilirubin, etc etc - were elevated. In particular, my AST was 49 (normal range 8-48) and my ALT was 72 (normal range 7-54). 

My urologist was not concerned, but my primary care provider was. He instructed me not to drink for a month - I do not drink much, maybe 2-3 beers a week at most - and then re-check everything in order to rule out hepatitis or NAFLD. I do not smoke and never have, I exercise 3-4 times a week, I’m slightly overweight but I’ve kept nearly 100lbs off for a decade, I do not use drugs, I do not have unprotected sex or and am regularly tested for STDs anyway, minus the hypogonadism I am physically very healthy.

So, I did that today and have already gotten the results back. Everything has gone down significantly, except for the ALT, which is now 81.

I should note that the ALT was trending over 100 for a few years and the more weight I lose the better it looks, but I’m still not loving the sudden reversal of that trend.

My thoughts here are twofold:
1. I could stand to drop another 10-15lbs, which I’m actively in the process of doing.
2. I take numerous other medications that are metabolized in the liver first thing in the morning, and I took both of those - 10mg each of Trintellix and Vyvanse - before the blood test today.

So maybe both of those things threw off the liver panel. 

However, I’d sure love to hear that from professionals as I’m now starting to panic about having liver failure or something as an otherwise healthy and active male in my early thirties.

AskDocs,NAFLD,178kyh7,Do I Really Have an Anxiety Disorder?,"I am a 35 years old male. I am 182 cm and 91 kg. I am from Turkey. No alcohol, no smoking.  
2 months ago I tried a liquid THC by vaping. After half an hour my heart rate increased rapidly. It goes up and down between 80 and 120 bpm very quickly and I felt like my chest is on fire. I waited a few hours and I went to the doctor. I told them the truth and they gave me Diazepam through IV and checked my ECG, it was normal. I started to have attack randomly in two days. Then I visited a psychiatrist.  
He told me that I had an anxiety attack and put me on Xanax(2 x 0.5mg), escitalopram(1 x 10mg) and mirtazapine(1 x 30mg). I started to feel fine with them but after two weeks I had another episode of increased heart rate(Around 110 bpm). It didn't go away for hours. But I was fine most of the time. 1 week ago he adjusted the medications as Xanax(1 x 0.5mg), venlafaxine(1 x 75mg) and mirtazapine(1 x 15mg).  


At the same time last week I got a blood test. My ALT was 122(It was 104 last month). My AST was 53. I sometimes had increased ALT in the past 10 years but it never reached this high before. And this is the first time my AST increased over the limit. I also got a CT scan for the abdomen. It showed a 4 mm calcification on the liver segment 8.  
Right now I almost always have increased heart rate. It's almost always higher than 90 bpm while sitting or laying down. Sometimes it increases over 100. It's a really bad feeling. Since I am always like this, I started to think like maybe I don't have an anxiety disorder. My heart rate is over 90 bpm for over 24 hours right now. I know it's not that high my bpm is usually around 70-80 bpm while sitting. What should I do? Is this normal? Can attack be that long?  
Extra information:  
I have a chronic gastritis and I have been taking PPI for over 12 years. I switched among PPIs over the year. I had a Nissen fundoplication on December 2019 and cholecystectom on May 2021. Later that year I was diagnosed with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease grade 1.  
Before these happened I was already taking venlafaxine(1 x 37 mg) for over 8 years. But I stopped on January 2023. I was antidepressant free until 2 months ago.  


I read on internet NAFLD or PPIs can also cause increased heart rate but the results weren't conclusive.

I thought it was connected my migraines, as it started up when I was due for my Botox. The botox kicked in, but the headaches didn’t really stop, and my ear continued to turn red. I’ve noticed that it tends to occur at the same times daily, regardless of when I sleep, wake up, eat, or take my medications. 

It wasn’t too painful at first, but now it has gotten to the point where I have to put ice on it. It is warm to the touch. None of my doctors know what’s wrong. My primary care doctor thought it was an infection but the redness completely goes away before flaring up again. My dermatologist thought it was a type of dermatitis, and tried a steroid cream then an anti fungal cream. Neither one did anything. I finally went to my neurologist and she thinks it maybe something like hemicrainal continua, but I was unresponsive to indomethcain.

No history of smoking, previous period of drinking 1 drink roughly 1x/week over a 2 month period June-July 2023, which is over. 

diagnoses: T2D (no retinopathy, no neuropathy, since 2014 age 10, a1c under 6% for at least the past 3 years), NASH (previously NAFLD, first noted 2017 age 14, saw GI inconsistently), Iron deficieny anemia, MDD, ASD, ADHD-C. 

Medication: Metformin ER, Ozempic, Lexapro, Focalin XR, Trazodone, Testosterone Cypionate, Yuvafem, Ferrous Sulfate, Vitamin E.

Main complaint: Liver fibrosis, unsure of how long I have had it

Over the past year or so my endo has noticed that my ALT / AST levels have been slowly rising so I was told to see my GI again. I have a recurrent history of them being normal to mildy/moderately elevated, which started around 2017.

I have not had consistent monitoring with my liver. When I aged out of the pediatric GI I went without one until Sep 2022 who I was seeing for bowel issues related to metformin. after that was resolved I did not see him until August 2023, however my endo also monitors my lipids, my metabolic panel, and CBC alongside my A1C, which is how this was noticed.

They started going up around Novemember of 2022. I've had a lot happen since then, so I'll try to list everything I can remember, including instances of sickness and significant medication changes:

- I started masculizing HRT, October 2022
- I stopped Metformin ER 2000mg for Ozempic October 2022
- I tested positive for Hep A antibodies in January 2023 (routine bloodwork). Unsure of when I contracted hep A
- I started Focalin XR for my ADHD, Feburary 2023
- By around March 2023 I gained 10 pounds and was my highest at 192 lb. I think this is from a combination of starting testosterone and Ozempic by itself doing nothing for me
- I went back on the metformin ER , 1000mg / day while still being on Ozempic 1mg weekly
- Since Feb 2023 I have been changing my diet, previously I would eat nothing but high-fat high-carb (150+/day)  with very little fruit and no vegetables(ever)  and fast food 3x-4x a week. As of now I eat closer to 100 carbs / day, a lot more protien, eat fast food 2-3 times a month max, and have vegetables with nearly every meal. It wasn't a sudden shift though, I have had to work my way up to this
- I had a bout of recurrent UTIs (roughly 10) which included a few courses of antibiotics and a *lot* of AZO (Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride 99.5mg), Roughly 2 times a day for at least a week out of a month around from April to August 2023. 
- I've started exercising, brisk walk roughly 45min-1hr/day I plan to add more variety but I'm still new to this. Haven't consistently exercised in roughly 8 years before this due to mental illness.

So like, I lost 13 pounds, I eat so much healthier than I used to, I exercise now, am I doing enough? Is liver fibrosis reversible? If it is, and I am successful at repairing my liver, am I still at a higher risk of getting it again? Is there a set 'amount' of weight I need to lose before I see an improvement? Will what I'm doing even help, or is cirrhrosis inevitable?

When I say this I'm not trying to imply that I'm shifting my lifestyle just for better test results, or I'll go back to my old habits once I'm in a healthy range. But I'd like to know what to expect going forward, and if the pace at which I'm trying to heal my body from eating nothing but bread, cheese, and fried food for the first 20 years of my life is fast enough. I'm taking this very seriously - however I do have a extensive history of disordered eating (restriction, purging, binging, cutting back on insulin when I was on it) so if I go into this too fast I worry that I'll relapse. 

Any advice is appreciated, I thought I was doing well but I feel so lost right now.

AskDocs,NAFLD,16c7eht,Was admitted overnight for low potassium. 32 weeks pregnant. Is this the correct treatment plan? Uneasy as my OB is on vacation.,"30 female
215 lbs 
Gestational diabetes- not on insulin, fasting numbers have never been high
NAFLD- mild
Genetic mixed hyperlipidemia 

Now gestational hypertension 

I went into L and D a couple days ago because I wasn’t feeling right. Headache, weakness, overall malaise, elevated BP, blurry vision 

I was concerned about preeclampsia.

I get there and my BP is elevated at each 15 min check. I get told it’s anxiety.. naturally. Elevated but not a level they treat per the nurse. Sitting around 140s/90s some 150s.

Some protein in urine, but not enough to warrant concern of preeclampsia.

Get blood work done. I’m mildly anemic which I knew. The kicker: my potassium was 2.7

They gave me a dose of oral potassium and retested 2 hours later. No improvement so they kept me overnight for IV potassium and more oral dosages.

It raised to 3.1 and the OB on call felt much better about that and released me with a script for
Potassium 2x a day.

All BP checks while admitted were elevated except for 1.

Since discharge my BP has remained elevated. My OBs office (my OB is on vacation) created the plan of:

1. No BP meds until I reach the threshold of 160/110 bc it can mask preeclampsia symptoms.. but I’m already having headaches and vision changes, which are also symptoms? So how am I supposed to know?

2. 400-500mg of magnesium to hopefully aid headaches.

3. Self monitor BP multiple times a day, call if it reaches 160/110 to see if I should go in

4. Redo preeclampsia labs on an outpatient basis on Monday. (1 week since admit)

5. Appointment with my OB on Tuesday. 

6. More water. I already drink a ton

7. Eat protein. I already do this. If anything I need more carbs because i believe I’ve cut them out too much post GD diagnosis.

Is this the right move? I feel hesitant because my headache was intense tonight. I took Tylenol, it got better, then worse, now better again. 

This is not my OB that created this plan. I’m labeled high risk. It was a midwife and Rn that created the plan. 

Readings from today. The readings after “=“ are adjusted because I took my at home cuff today and it’s 5 off on the top number, 10 off on the bottom.

AskDocs,NAFLD,1611m6k,"History of Elevated Liver Enzymes (ALT, AST, ALP, GGT)","Hello,

For the last 6 or 7 years, I \[31M\], \[5'9\], \[White\] have had a history of elevated liver enzymes. I've had ALT levels up to 220 and elevated AST, sometimes ALP, and GGT. The thing is, I have a habit of getting a metabolic panel relatively soon after I consume any amount of alcohol. Here's a breakdown of how soon I've had my blood drawn after drinking alcohol and the enzyme levels that resulted:

* June 30, 2016 - Drank 4 - 6 beers night before - blood drawn next morning - ALT (216) - AST (77)
   * prompted ""how much alcohol or tylenol have you been consuming?
      * I responded by saying I got pretty drunk the night before so doc said we should monitor and retest after I've abstained from alcohol for a few weeks.
* July 21, 2016 - Abstained from alcohol - ALT (81) - AST (30)
   * Doc notices the drop but the ALT is obviously still not good. At this time I really had no idea what was happening so I was freaking out. Again, tells me to abstain from alcohol and retest in a few weeks
* August 5, 2016 - I went to the beach and did drink a small amount, maybe 4 beers over the course of a week ... can't remember but not heavy drinking at all - ALT (137) - AST (60)
   * Doc sees the numbers went back up and scolded me for drinking...
      * I responded and let her know that I only drank the ""recommended amount"" or even less for men over the vacation
   * Again.... abstain from alcohol and retest.
   * No answers
* October 6, 2016 - No alcohol since vacation (2 months basically) - ALT (27) - AST (16)
   * Doctor simply is happy with the results and gives me the ""the recommended amount of alcohol for men is 2 drinks a day.""
   * No answers, just assumes I'm an alcoholic

Fast forward a year (this is interesting):

* July 3rd, 2017 - Routine Metabolic panel - ALT (74) - AST (73)
   * Literal message on labs: ""Liver enzymes elevated. Could be alcohol, back off tylenol and alcohol.""
* July 8th, 2017 - I had a panic attach which resulted in me being hospitalized (I had never experienced one before and freaked tf out) - They performed a metabolic panel:
   * ALT (43) - AST (21)
      * HOW DID IT DROP THIS QUICKLY AFTER ONLY 5 DAYS? My numbers have always taken months to return to normal.
   * Can't recall my alcohol intake at this time, but I imagine it was low to none with these numbers

Fast forward a few more years at this point I have accepted that any alcohol I consume will show on my blood work for weeks to months to come:

* January 15, 2020 - I assume I got wasted on new years this year but I'm not positive - ALT (45) - AST(23)
   * No concern from doctor
* May 11th, 2021 - Got wasted about a week before this panel - ALT (174) - AST (56) - ALP (122)
   * message from doc: ""Normal thyroid studies, Cholesterol mildly elevated mediterranean diet and exercise most days of the week. CBC shows no evidence of anemia or infection  
Your liver functions are elevated I would like to repeat these in 2 weeks through the lab no alcohol or Tylenol use I have placed the orders just make lab appointment Please don't hesitate to call or e-mail with questions or concerns""
      * Total cholesterol: 204
      * HDL : 45, LDL: 137, VLDL: 27, Triglycerides: 120
* June 2nd, 2021 - Abstained from alcohol completely - ALT (100) - AST (50) - ALP (95) - GGT (84)
   * doc's message ""As per previous message liver us has been ordered Ultimately referring to a liver specialist will be needed is elevations persist depending on ultrasound results""
* July 6th, 2021 - still no alcohol - Ultrasound is performed on abdomen
   * IMPRESSION: 
      * Unremarkable study of the abdomen.  
GRAYSCALE ULTRASOUND OF THE ABDOMEN:  
TECHNIQUE: Multiple grayscale ultrasound images were obtained of the abdomen.   
PROVIDED CLINICAL INDICATION: R74.8-Abnormal levels of other serum enzymes Abnormal levels of other serum enzymes  
ADDITIONAL CLINICAL INDICATION: None available   
COMPARISON: None available  
FINDINGS:  
PANCREAS: No abnormality visualized.  
LIVER: Normal echotexture without focal abnormality.  
PORTAL VEIN: Normal flow direction.  
GALLBLADDER: No stones or wall thickening.  
BILE DUCTS: Normal caliber. The common duct is 2 mm.  
SPLEEN: Normal size and echotexture.  
RIGHT KIDNEY: Normal size. No hydronephrosis.   
LEFT KIDNEY: Normal size. No hydronephrosis.  
AORTA AND INFERIOR VENA CAVA: Normal where visualized.  
ADDITIONAL FINDINGS: None. No ascites.

At this point I stopped caring about any of this stuff because I got no answers, nothing on ultrasound, and my doc's response was ""Liver gallbladder ultrasound is normal, no liver abnormality seen."" and that was that. Nothing on NAFLD or any other concern.

**FAST FORWARD TO 2023**

I'm 31 yrs old now, I really don't drink often, and typically go months without, I have been exercising 5 days a week since June, 2023 with weight training. I was also running up to 12 miles a week, 200 pushups, 300+ crunches etc since early 2022. At this point I have really started to change my diet and exercise patterns. I have made a conscious effort to improve my health... Or so I thought

* August 24th, 2023 - I got wasted precisely the night of July 22nd, 2023 - ALT (122) - AST (42)
   * I have a new doctor at this point and I warned her of my history with elevated LFT's. I explained to her that the last time I consumed alcohol was over 4 weeks ago but I did drink heavily. I told her the LFT's will likely be elevated due to my history with alcohol and these tests.

Just for reference, I have a family member who is 2 years younger than me who is a chronic alcoholic. To the point where we literally just had an intervention this last week. They have been having these tests done routinely this year due to developing alcoholic neuropathy, jaundice, and other alcohol related health issues. While their ALT and AST have been elevated, they are NOWHERE NEAR how high mine get usually, and they go down VERY FAST. They were on a 2 week bender just before the intervention, drinking bottles of liquor at a time, and their ALT/AST were under 100.... HOW TF IS THIS POSSIBLE????? Then they drop down to the ""normal range"" within a few days of abstaining... It's so frustrating.

Anyways, if you made it this far and actually read all of this then THANK YOU. At this point, I really don't know why my liver enzymes fluctuate the way they do. I figured if I had NAFLD it would show on my Ultrasound from 2 years ago. It seems if I don't drink alcohol at all, the numbers eventually go down to a healthy range but it takes up to 3 months. 

I'm considering a massive change in my diet like cutting out a lot of saturated fats / sugars to see how this helps as a lot of resources online claim this is due to fat in the liver. I just don't know because it doesn't seem consistent with my ultrasound...

Any advice on how to manage these enzymes would be greatly appreciated. I apologize again for this insanely lengthy post.

&#x200B;

TL;DR : My liver enzymes dramatically increase after any alcohol consumption and show up on my labs for about 2/3 months. If I abstain from alcohol entirely for 3 months, the numbers are in the 20s or lower. I'm not sure how dangerous this is or what I should do moving forward. I'm convinced I have some sort of alcohol allergy/sensitivity.

AskDocs,fatty liver,1odapi6,"14 years undiagnosed (30F). My body is facing the consequences, and I’m desperate to finally receive the right treatment. How can I find a doctor who truly thinks outside the box?","TLDR: I’ve been severely ill for 14 years with worsening systemic symptoms that no doctor has connected or properly investigated. Despite an extremely healthy lifestyle and young age, I now have prediabetes, fatty liver and advanced fatty pancreas, arterial plaque, and constant debilitating fatigue and other issues. I’m deteriorating fast, can barely work, and the system keeps dismissing me as “fine.” I urgently need a doctor who can look at my whole case before my health collapses completely.

I’ve been dealing with systemic health issues for 14 years now, since the age of 16 (almost half my life). Over time, I’ve realized that there’s very little space in healthcare to deal with long-term systemic conditions, as the system tends to focus mainly on problems that are easily detectable or straightforward to diagnose. I’m at my wit’s end, because even though I’ve searched hard and learned a great deal about what’s going wrong with my body, I still haven’t found a doctor who is willing to connect the dots. These symptoms have had a severe impact on my life: they’ve affected my ability to go to school, my career choices, how much I can work, how I spend my energy and free time, my hobbies, my financial situation, and even decisions about whether I can start a family in this state. I want to explain in this post why I still don’t have a diagnosis even though it's a long story, because it’s crucial to understanding why I’m completely stuck, what I'm looking for, and why I am absolutely exhausted from having to search my way through the medical system. Please hear me out. I absolutely have no idea where to go anymore. Thank you for your patience.

When I was 16, I suddenly developed a stabbing pain just under my chest, around the midriff in the epigastric region. It lasted for about two weeks and was so severe that it sometimes made it hard to breathe for a minute or so. I went to the GP, but she laughed it off, saying it was probably nothing. The pain eventually went away on its own, but right after that, I developed massive fatigue that came out of nowhere, and it never went away. Over the years, more symptoms appeared: mostly increasing muscle issues, hunger, thirst. Because there wasn’t any single “red flag” symptom, after only minimal testing (a few vitamins, etc.), it was concluded by doctors that the problem is unexplainable.

Back then, my lifestyle was already fine. But over the past decade, I have done everything possible to be as kind as I can to my body and live in the healthiest way imaginable. I cut out all added sugars completely. I have never drunk alcohol or smoked, I maybe eat fast food twice a year at most. I bicycle everywhere each day and stay physically active. I also noticed early on that carbohydrates affect me very strongly: I seem to experience (subjective) massive blood sugar swings whenever I eat them, even when they’re complex carbs. For example, eating even whole-grain products, even combined with enough healthy(!) fats and protein, leaves me hungrier than before or makes me extremely sleepy and shaky, even with the smallest amounts of carbs. Because of this, I’ve been lower-carb to varying degrees for nearly a decade now. Despite this, all my symptoms remain. They just become even worse if I don’t live an absolutely strict, “perfectly pure” healthy lifestyle. I won’t go into every single symptom here, but you can ask if relevant.

Over the past ten years, I’ve also been put through various programs required by my health insurance, and to be honest, they’ve been absolute hell for me. The constant focus has been on the idea that I must be doing something wrong in my lifestyle, my mindset, or my physical activity, and that I just need to change that endlessly. For example, I was told that my hunger wasn’t real, but rather probably emotional eating, even when I explained that I experienced excruciating nightly hunger that keeps me often awake for an hour to hours. Or that my fatigue wasn’t actual tiredness, but a mental or motivational issue. That my muscle issues are deconditioning, or else it's overconditioning, or central sensitization. I have been told so many times to eat less unhealthy, drink less alcohol, be less inactive, and stop smoking, even though I already don't do any of these things, it's also just standard advice.

Every time I asked to see a specialist, I was instead sent back into these programs. When I finally did get referrals, the referral letters were written to “exclude a physical cause.” That meant that the specialists didn’t do much further testing, they just sent me back to CBT or GET again. The underlying conviction was always the same: that there could be absolutely nothing wrong with my body, even though it was not really tested thoroughly. I should add that a family member of mine went through the exact same process with the same GP a few years later. She was sick for a year, couldn't work and couldn't do many physical activities anymore, and her symptoms were labeled as “central sensitization” and IBS during that time. After pushing hard for more tests, it turned out to be stage four pancreatic cancer, and she sadly passed away shortly after. I’m not mentioning this because I think I have cancer, but to show that this system is not infallible and that physical issues can and do get missed. I have switched GP but by now my medical record is already quite smudged and on top of that I noticed this is also an insurance issue.

Eventually, last year, I decided to go to an academic hospital and pay out of pocket for more extensive standard testing, something that hadn’t been done for me in over a decade. I had standard blood work, an abdominal ultrasound, and an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) done, for the first time in 13 years.

The results were as follows:

* Prediabetes: glucose levels were only the the prediabetic range at the peak, but insulin levels were massively elevated, and elevated HOMA-IR.
* Fatty liver.
* Advanced pancreatic lipomatosis.
* Plaque in the arteries, including in the carotid arteries.
* A remarkable amount of gas in the abdomen (it even complicated the process of the ultrasound), which my physiotherapist had already noted several times before, though it hasn't given me noticeable symptoms to everyone's surprise.

Though there was still no absolutely alarming findings: no official diabetes, organ failure or fibrosis (yet), this was surprising to me, considering my healthy lifestyle and a BMI of 21, and that I was only 29 years old. I understand that lean-NAFLD exists, but what concerns me most is that my organs are already in poor condition despite such a healthy lifestyle, and mostly these findings combined with that I also feel absolutely terrible. The problem is that I’ve already been living the prescribed lifestyle for these conditions for years, and yet I’ve still developed them. That means there’s currently no way for me to stop the progression.

Following the hospital’s advice, I made an appointment with a gastroenterologist to investigate a possible cause for the fatty organs. I paid for this visit myself and asked in advance whether the specialist would look at the whole digestive system and the metabolism connected to it. I was told he would focus on the complete digestive system as a whole. However, during the appointment, the doctor only focused on the liver, saying it looked fine since there was no fibrosis. He added that fatty liver occurs often and is just a natural variation, advising me to “just live my life” and check again in a year. I stressed that I’m a young woman with a healthy lifestyle, yet I’m experiencing severe, worsening symptoms that are making my life increasingly unlivable. I pointed out that the issue isn’t just the fatty liver, but also all the other things. And that original stabbing chest pain, which I always mention, is completely ignored every single time. While I just want the question answered: what is the cause of these things together as a whole, and how to treat it? And even if a cause can't be found: I need some kind of treatment, care, and supervision with my issues.

He responded that for muscle issues I should go to a neurologist, for glucose issues to a diabetologist (who, with the same logic, might just say it’s “only prediabetes” and therefore not serious), and for arteries to a phlebologist, etc. In other words, each issue belongs to a different specialist, and no one looks at the overall picture. But I can’t wait until my condition worsens to the point where I finally have full-blown diabetes, actual fibrosis, or such severe symptoms that I can’t work at all anymore before someone takes it seriously. I also can’t financially afford (and timewise, cause this might take literal years) to see all these individual doctors privately, one after another, only for each to say that their specific part looks fine. Because of my health, I can only work part-time already, and I can't get any disability benefits because on paper I'm healthy as a horse. And I can’t go through the insured system again, because they’ll just send me back to CBT or GET instead of proper medical testing. My quality of life is getting lower and lower with each passing year.

So, where do I go from here? Where can I find a doctor who will connect the dots and truly understand the severity of this situation and understand that this is not normal for a woman going through her teens, twenties, and early thirties? I need someone who has access to testing and who can also refer me to the right specialists, while keeping the whole picture in mind, so I don’t have to keep re-explaining and fighting to be taken seriously.

Prediabetes is usually asymptomatic so doesn’t really explain anything. 

Fatty liver is super common and MASLD should not be diagnosed based just on a bit of fat on one ultrasound scan. This finding could be totally irrelevant. 

Arterial plaque— you didn’t say if this was found to be more severe than expected for your age or anything, so I’m not sure. Almost everyone in their 30s has at least some atherosclerosis so it depends how much, how it was detected, etc. 

Advanced fatty pancreas is not a term I have ever heard before. In a lean person I would assume it’s just a variant of normal. There is always some fat in/around the pancreas. 

Gas in bowels is normal and I’m not sure there is any amount that would automatically be considered pathologic as opposed to just within range of normal. And as you said, in that respect you don’t seem to have any related symptoms. 

Fatigue and hunger seem to be your most severe symptoms. Like others have said these don’t always (or often) have a findable explanation or fixable underlying problem. If anyone might be able to find an exotic underlying problem it’s probably an endocrinologist.",72.0

I’d like to give a bit more context to clarify what I’m running into and what I’m looking for.

I’ve already seen a private endocrinologist who ran standard tests (TSH, cortisol, etc.), which were normal. It is however good advice you gave, cause it definately fits my symptoms. However, the issue is that once those common causes are excluded, the conclusion tends to be “you’re healthy,” rather than asking what else it could be\*.\* I don’t believe it’s something extremely rare, just something outside the usual checklist. I’d also like someone to consider how the sudden chest/epigastric pain that started everything might connect to the later metabolic findings, and to the symptoms alltogether (not just one). It feels a bit like a standard script is run, which I don't say to critisize the individual doctor, but for me it just adds to the personal frustration.

In academic clinics, the process is slow and fragmented: brief appointments, long waits for results, and limited follow-up if nothing directly gets found. At the clinic I went to it took 2,5 months to get the results of the tests, then another 1,5 month to ask for clarification on the result. I don't want to critique the system as I understand how overburdened the medical system is. However, ideally for my personal situation given how complex it seems and that I've already been waiting for 14 years, I’d like to find a more accessible internist who can look at the whole picture and help coordinate next steps. Even if he would have access to less testing, that he at least knows about what options exists in the medical world and what centers are best for that. I am willing to see someone privately for that as long as it gets my situation finally thorougly considered. Do you have any advice on where to look for that kind of care?",7.0

For over a year my husband has been dealing with gastro issues. He says he feels like there is sludge in his stomach and he has violent painful diarrhea very frequently, I’d say at least 4 of the 7 days of the week on average. Lately it’s gotten worse and he has stomach pain while he goes to the bathroom. I made him see a gastro dr finally a few weeks ago. He ordered bloodwork (basic cbc type stuff), an abdominal ultrasound, a stool sample and he’s scheduled for a colonoscopy in a month. Today while going to the bathroom, having one of his “sludgy poops” he was saying it was very painful and then vomited. Later in the day he went again and said he felt like he was gonna vomit again but didn’t.

He hasn’t seen the Dr again yet, but from his chart we can see The stool sample and blood came back normal. The abdominal ultrasound did show fatty liver and that gas was obscuring the view of his pancreas.

What should I be asking the Dr at this point? Is a mri or ct scan of stomach better? Would an ultrasound show god forbid a tumor if we had to worry about that?

I should mention over a year ago he took ozempic (only a few months, not on it now) and I’ve always been worried it seems to line up to when the stomach issues started. I read about some type of stomach paralysis but would that persist like this for over a year?

But, medical care is expensive. So, long story but here goes. I had a grapefruit sized cyst on my right ovary when I was about 12/13. They had me on some meds and monitored it up until it was gum-ball sized. But I can’t remember what medication. It definitely wasn’t birth control because of my age. Maybe a GnRH agonist? I’m pretty sure it ruptured after they stopped monitoring it. It’s been ages but if my memory serves correctly I had a horrible pain in my lower abdomen especially when sitting down standing up or going to the toilet. I can’t remember how long it lasted. But I cannot confirm this as I was not taken to see if it ruptured.
Anyways, fast forward and I’m 16 and still have not started my first period. I beg my mother to take me back to the doctor and she takes me. They do blood work and said I was vitamin D deficient and found I had hypothyroidism. They started me on thyroid medication and gave me a pack of vitamin D supplements and did a progesterone challenge. Which triggered a withdrawal bleed. After that, nada. Nothing. I have had blood work done multiple times, and they always tell me it’s normal except occasionally my thyroid. I had scans done. They couldn’t see my ovaries but didn’t rescan or do a ct scan. I was told I was pre diabetic and insulin resistant. And am on metformin 500 once daily. previously also told I had slightly high cholesterol and fatty liver. Most recent blood work not long ago all came back normal tho. But to this day all the doctors want to do is tell me to lose weight and go on birth control. Yes, I’m fat. Have been since 1st grade. But, that cannot be my only issue. Woman bigger than me have normal cycles and healthy pregnancies. They did bloodwork to look into pcos but they said it did not come back indicative of pcos. To this day I have never had a spontaneous actual period. I was on HRT for a short time but it was too expensive for me to continue. I did another progesterone challenge not too long ago and it did not trigger a withdrawal bleed. Granted this time I did it myself with leftover progesterone I had still from my HRT(10 mg for 10 days.). So, I can only guess I have low estrogen now. I know a reproductive endocrinologist is most likely my best option but, currently out of the question unfortunately because of costs. (I would be paying out of pocket.)

I suppose an FSH of 12 could be considered ‘borderline’ but 18 is definitely high. Another FSH level and estradiol level measured at the same time would support a POI diagnosis if the FSH is high and the E2 is low. An anti-Mullerian hormone measurement isn’t totally necessary, but if it’s very low it also suggest that your follicles are depleted. Genetic testing may be helpful. You could have Turner syndrome (or a mosaic variation of it) or carry a Fragile X permutation.

If you had other puberty changes such as breast development then you had some estrogen at some point. But this doesn’t necessarily narrow down the diagnosis.

Birth control pills are fine if that’s what you have easiest access to, although usually I’ll put POI patients on estradiol and progesterone (like menopause HT).

I became very weak, have muscle pain, very easily dizzy and am short on breath from the easiest household chores, dizziness, had nausea but no vomiting. Am extreeemly tired and slept 16hrs straight on some weekends.


Went to the ER once and got an infusion, CRP was good, blood levels ok, liver markers, Calprotectin and others too. Stool test didn’t show any abnormalies - no parasites, viruses, bacteria… to my surprise: even Elastase is ok (320)? 
Sono didn’t show anything yet, but I am scheduled for an EUS and endoscopy next week (so grateful!!). 


I tried many things like psyllium, pre- and probiotics, etc. Loperamid was the only thing that temporarily helped against acute diarrhea, but led to extrem postprandial fullness and pain. 


By experimenting with food I found out that consuming fat is the main issue regarding frequency, urgency and texture of the steatorrhoe, there was a very clear and timely link. After doing a lot of online research while waiting for test results I finally tried Kreon a week ago and with a high enough dosage, it really really helps and I am even feeling a bit more energetic. But I have nausea now every evening and morning and the stool got even lighter. 


I had very similar symptoms but with much much more pain for over 5months 3 years ago, did a colonoscopy and an endoscopy. We ruled out many possible factors like celiac disease, MC, colitis ulcerosa,… chlostridium difficile, SIBO. 

The only (?) organ that never got checked was the pancreas. 

Does anyone have any possible explanation for these symptoms? I am especially scared of pancreatic tumor, since my grandma nearly died of a certain pancreatic disease when she was my age. 
But if this sounds more like another disease, please let me know 🙏

I know that the EUS will be the best analysis for that, but I am getting nervous and impatient and will be a bit more prepared and know what to expect. 
Highly appreciate any input / advice - 
thank you so much in advance!

Avoid alcohol anyway. This may seem like some life advice but nothing good ever comes from it. I have been lucky that I never got near it. Alcohol will slowly destroy you anyway (and certainly overburdens your pancreas).
For now, I don't think this looks anything life threatening but you need to take some decisions and change a few things about how and what you put in your body.

AskDocs,fatty liver,1o60j67,"Persistent  high proteins and globulins , normal albumina and liver /kidney function , should I beworried ?","Hi doctors,
I’m a 35-year-old male from El Salvador. For context: I’m generally healthy, no alcohol, non-smoker, currently on Ozempic (semaglutide) for weight loss and mild fatty liver. I’ve lost about 17 lbs in 7 weeks.

However, recent blood work shows persistently high total proteins and globulins, even though my albumin and other labs look normal:
	•	Total proteins: 12.4 g/dL (6.4–8.3)
	•	Globulin: 7.76 g/dL (2.0–3.6)
	•	Albumin: 4.67 g/dL (3.5–5.0)
	•	A/G ratio: 0.60 (low because of high globulins)
	•	ALT: 50 U/L (slightly elevated)
	•	AST, GGT, bilirubin, ALP: normal (GGT and ALP even a bit low)
	•	Creatinine and CBC: normal

Relevant history:
	•	Had a severe parasitic intestinal infection in mid-2024 with intestinal bleeding, treated successfully.
	•	Chronic sinusitis and a past chronic prostatitis, both much improved now.
	•	Mild fatty liver confirmed on ultrasound.

My doctor suspects this might just be polyclonal hyperglobulinemia from chronic inflammation or immune system overactivity after the infection, not something malignant.
I was advised to do a serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP) to confirm that it’s polyclonal.

I’m quite anxious about whether this could be a monoclonal gammopathy (MGUS) or something serious, even though I have no symptoms (no fatigue, bone pain, anemia, or kidney issues).

Questions:
	1.	How likely is MGUS at my age (35) with this pattern?
	2.	Can chronic inflammation and past parasitic infection really cause such high total proteins?
	3.	Should I also test for autoimmune markers or just do the SPEP?
	4.	Is there any risk to my kidneys or liver with proteins this high?

Any insight would be greatly appreciated — I’m trying to stay calm but the numbers look scary.

AskDocs,fatty liver,1o4ach9,Is it safe to slowly taper off alcohol with liver disease,"Hey there. I recently had a few blood draws and 2 ultrasounds done. All of my ultrasounds said fatty liver, one mentioned coarse echogenicity. The blood work all came back elevated for AST/ALT, and GGT, though the latest one had improved quite a lot with both AST/ALT dropping by over 100. Said my liver is 21.3cm, portal vein was normal, no signs of ascites or jaundice, bilirubin was normal. 

None of my doctors have been concerned, and they know how much I drink (which is a lot). I tried to cold turkey but went into withdrawal so I’m freaking out. Would it be safe to slowly taper, or could even that push me into liver failure?

AskDocs,fatty liver,1o2crq2,They found nodules in my husband's omentum and I'm riddled with anxiety,"My husband has been complaining about abdominal pain for a while and have had check ups and a few tests but they mostly came up normal aside from a diagnosis of mild fatty liver.

But when it persisted we opted to get a full abdominal CT scan at the hospital where my dad works.

  
Here are the results:

Multiple axial tomographic sections of the abdomen without contrast were obtained.

CT images reveal the following findings:

LIVER: normal size, margins and configuration. There is no focal lesion. No biliary ectasia noted.

GALLBLADDER: Well-distended with no intraluminal densities or wall thickening.

PANCREAS AND SPLEEN: Normal size and tissue homogeneity. There are no focal masses noted  within.

OMENTUM AND MESENTERY: There is focal increase in attenuation of the mesentery with thin peripheral band of soft tissue attenuation at the left  hemiabdomen. Several enlarged mesenteric nodes are seen in this region with diameters ranging from 0.8cm to 1.2cm in their short axis dimension.

GASTROINTESTINAL TRACT: The  stomach and bowels are undistended precluding adequate assessment. The bowel pattern is  non obstructive. The appendix is not dilated with AP diameter  of 5.9mm. No appendicolith is seen. No surrounding periappendiceal fat stranding or enlarged mesenteric nodes.

ADRENAL GLAND: Normal.

KIDNEYS: Normal size, position and configuration. No evidence of solid mass, cyst or radio-opaque calculi. The pelvovalyces and ureters are not dilated.

URINARY BLADDER: Distended with no intravesical densities.

PROSTATE: Normal size.

VESSELS: Abdominal aorta and inferior vena cava are normal in size and caliber.

OSSEOUS STRUCTURES: The thoracolumbar spine and the bony pelvis are intact.  
LUNG BASES: Unremarkable.

IMPRESSION: The increase attenuation of the mesentery with a pseudocapsule in the left hemiabdomen with enlarged mesenteric nodes may relate to mesenteric panniculitis. Other differentials include mesenteric inflammation versus a mesenteric neoplastic process. Correlation with  other clinical parameters suggested for further evaluation.

I have these current diagnosed medical conditions: PCOS, Hashimoto’s, Hypertensive Disorder, Asthma, Vitamin D Deficiency, Hyperlipidemia, prediabetes, Fatty Liver Disease, Anemia, a kidney cyst and an unspecified heart arrhythmia. I also see a neuro-ophthalmologist next week. Nearly 5 years ago, I went to see an endocrinologist for high ACTH and high Prolactin. She ran some additional labs and just blamed it on my PCOS. Fast forward to about 6 months ago I voiced some concerns that I still felt unwell so she ran more labs and my ACTH and DHEA-s came back abnormal. She actually sent me to a different endocrinologist and she did some more tests for Cushing’s and I’ll try to attach all labs below.  She was leaning towards blaming everything on my PCOS as well so I got a referral to Duke Endocrinology which I have an appt there in December. I have had an abdominal CT (w/o) contrast that was “normal”. I have also been having issues with the arrhythmia and with my eyes. I failed a side vision test twice, failed a depth perception test, didn’t do good on a color vision test and have 2 enlarged nerves on both of my eyes in the same place. My symptoms include:

1.	Rapid heart rate increase when standing and palpitations
	2.	Episodes of arrhythmia and irregular heartbeat
	3.	Dizziness, lightheadedness, and faintness (worse when standing or exerting)
	4.	Feeling better when lying down
	5.	Swelling in feet, legs, and fingers (worse in heat)
	6.	Cold hands and feet, flushing, and excessive sweating
	7.	Shortness of breath and trouble taking a deep breath
	8.	Chest pressure or heaviness
	9.	Chronic severe fatigue and daily exhaustion
	10.	General weakness and exercise intolerance
	11.	Memory problems, brain fog, and cognitive changes
	12.	Heat intolerance and worsening symptoms with exertion or position changes
	13.	Mild sleep apnea with oxygen dropping to 82%
	14.	Frequent respiratory and ear infections
	15.	Gastrointestinal issues, nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea
	16.	High ACTH and DHEA-S with abnormal cortisol rhythm
	17.	Rapid 100+ lb weight gain and purple stretch marks
	18.	Irregular or absent periods for 3+ months
	19.	Hair loss and mood swings
	20.	Prediabetes, insulin resistance, and fatty liver disease
	21.	Chronic lower back pain and muscle fatigue
	22.	Absolute scotoma, depth perception problems, and optic nerve enlargement
	23.	Color vision changes and failed side vision tests

Any insights or others experiences are welcome. Any knowledge on certain conditions to mention to the doctors are welcomed too. Really anything at all 
It won’t allow me to attach labs but most recent labs: 
ACTH, Plasma: 73.0 pg/ml
3 months ago Cortisol AM: 10.7 ug/dl
Prolactin: 11.0 ng/ml
Aldosterone: 11.3 ng/dl

AskDocs,fatty liver,1o0qotc,Is my chest pain worth having re-evaluated at a different ER?,"29F, history of migraines with aura, GERD, and mild fatty liver. 260lbs. 5ft6in. Nonsmoker. No ETOH. No drug use. I woke up early Monday morning with sharp, stabbing epigastric pain at a 9/10. I took bentyl and pepcid and when the pain worsened and felt like it had moved to my left chest and left shoulder, I went to the ER to be evaluated. I also was experiencing some shortness of breath that I attributed to pain. 

The ER performed an EKG which showed sinus tachycardia with a heart rate of 120. Troponin WNL and second Troponin 3 hrs later was also WNL. BNP was WNL. Cxray was WNL. Chest CT and Abdominal CT both with ""Linear hypoattenuation in the main pulmonary artery. This is favored to be from motion artifact, but embolism is not excluded."" All other finders were normal. 

Blood work showed elevated WBC of 14.95x10e3/mcL. Slightly elevated RBC. Low MCH and MCHC. Plt 492x10e3/mcL. INR <0.93. D. Dimer of 1.78 mg/L FEU. I was given morphine and Zofran. And discharged with instructions to followup with my PCP and a cardiologist and gastroenterology. I was prescribed pantroprazole, famotidine, and Zofran at discharge with a diagnosis of GERD. 

My concern is that I'm still experiencing some pain near my upper-mid L sternum (dull, aching, 4/10), mild SOB and activity intolerance, L shoulder/neck discomfort, and L arm weakness. The symptoms aren't severe, but I'm worried that something may have been missed with the elevated D. Dimer and Plt count. Any suggestions would be great. The soonest cardiology appt is 2 months away.

AskDocs,fatty liver,1ntymj3,Elevated liver enzymes after mass gainer – what’s going on? not going down,"Hey everyone,  
I’m a 33M, 5’4”, 110 lbs. Pretty healthy overall, no chronic conditions, no alcohol, no meds besides topical minoxidil.

A couple months ago, I started using **Serious Mass** (about 70% of the recommended daily serving) + 5% topical minoxidil. My lifestyle is mostly sedentary (WFH, desk job, no exercise), and I don't drink, but I vape.

After one month of supplements, I gained \~6 lbs but also noticed elevated liver enzymes. Here’s what my labs showed back on **July 25**:

* **ALT**: 90 (↑, ref 0–50)
* **AST**: 56 (↑, ref 0–50)
* **ALP**: 311 (↑, ref 40–129)
* Bilirubin normal
* Albumin, protein normal

I stopped the supplement immediately. Fast forward 2 months, I lost the 6 lbs and went back to baseline weight (110 lbs). I just repeated labs on **Sep 29** and results are:

* **ALT**: 102 (↑)
* **AST**: 60 (↑)
* **ALP**: 221 (↑ but lower than before)
* **Direct bilirubin**: 0.3 (slightly ↑)
* **Total bilirubin**: 0.9 (normal)
* Albumin and protein still normal

So things improved a little (ALP down), but ALT/AST are still high, even a bit worse.

I calculated my **R factor** and it comes out to about **1.2**, which apparently suggests a cholestatic pattern.

**Questions:**

1. Is this still just supplement/weight-gainer related fatty liver that’s taking time to resolve, or should I be worried about something else?
2. If I want to gain weight again, what’s the safest way to do it without hurting my liver?
3. Could vaping have something to do with these findings?

Would really appreciate any input, especially if someone has gone through something similar.",4.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ntymj3/elevated_liver_enzymes_after_mass_gainer_whats/,MentalIndependence15,2025-09-29 17:17:31,1.0,post,,,

Doctor has ""no idea.""","[https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mba7fs/been\_bedbound\_sick\_for\_2\_months\_my\_doctor\_has\_no/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mba7fs/been_bedbound_sick_for_2_months_my_doctor_has_no/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)

original post, with all of the information.

It's now been 4 months since the initial episode, I have had surgery and recovered from it. I'm currently in a worse spot than I was when I made that post.

I'm sorry again for the text walls--there is a lot that has happened and a lot of important information.

**Symptoms updates:**

\* Difficulty swallowing has lessened but still present.  
\* I am completely and totally bedbound now. I can't even get out of bed to microwave or retrieve premade food from the fridge and am pretty hopeless without 24/7 support from my family. I can crawl for a couple minutes but it kills me. No idea how I'm going to bathe; we've just been putting it off. We are looking into if my insurance will cover a dedicated caregiver.  
\* Sleep apnea is so severe I cannot sleep for more than 10 minutes.  
\* Starting as soon as I woke up from surgery on the 12th, I've had intense visual snow and double vision as well as some eye discomfort. It has not improved.  
\* Pain from another source (i.e, pinching myself or having an IV inserted.) seems to help with the discomfort. Any sort of sensory input otherwise seems to make it worse.  
\* I've had no appetite and no bowel urges.  
\* My heartrate dropped to 45-50 bpm yesterday and stayed around 50 bpm for about an hour. It shoots up to 100+ if I move even a little bit.

**Diagnoses updates:**

\* I have non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This is brand new, so no treatment has been discussed yet.

**Medication updates:**

\* I am no longer taking the Clonazepam as it makes the sleep apnea worse.  
\* I was put on Midrodrine after surgery until yesterday, which I stopped to see if it was contributing to the sleep apnea.  
\* I was put on Ambien 5mg yesterday to help me sleep.

**Test result updates: (If you are verified, feel free to ask me for the chart details/images on any of these. I don't really care about privacy at this point I just want answers.)**

\* The 2.1cm kidney stone has been removed, there is a 3mm fragment remaining. The stone removed was mostly brushite, mixed with calcium oxalate. The stent was removed 2 days ago.  
\* Head CT w/o contrast to check for stroke after surgery, all clear.  
\* Cervical spine flexion/exertion MRI to check for cervical instability, all clear.  
\* Urine tests and cultures to check for infection; 300+ mgl protein, some bilirubin, trace ketones, high rbc wbc pyuria and mucus. pH is consistently on the high end but not abnormal levels. No growth in culture.  
\* No risk of pregnancy as I'm ace-celibate but doctors did a test anyway and it was negative.  
\* Iron deficiency as of the postoperative blood test. Co2 continues to be low.  
\* Post-op cortisol test showed as 0.5 ug/DL at 8 am, 0.4 at 1 pm, and after a cortisol stimulation test with ACTH; 10.80 at 30 minutes and 16.30 at 60 minutes.  
\* Hepatic function panel: 0.5 Direct Bilirubin  
\* US LIVER DOPPLER: Portal vein measuring up to 1.8 cm, and fatty liver disease.  
\* Breathing function clear  
\* At-home sleep study showed in August showed 2.1 apnea episodes and the lowest my oxygen got was 88%--not clinically significant.

**Doctor opinions updates:**

\* Most still tell me this is all anxiety. My psychologist does not think so.  
\* The kidney stone is, as we can now determine, not the trigger. We're hoping I at least start to feel a little bit better.  
\* The pulmonologist thinks anxiety is the cause but suggested that my symptoms line up with calcium deficiency, and that it might be dipping at certain points throughout the day and drawing from bones to restore which is why my blood tests keeping missing it. If this is the case I don't think it's caused by my nutrition, as I've continued having severe symptoms even in periods where I was eating and taking supplements.  
\* The attending doctors at the hospital suggested I go forward with hormone testing and investigating my pituitary function.  
\* My urologist says the makeup of the stone is consistent with 'alkaline urine' and might be an indicator of acidosis.

**Other notes:**

\* I'm awaiting setting up appointments for a gastroenterologist (my last one got cancelled by the clinic), an endocrinologist, and an at-home oxygen functions test. I also have an in-lab sleep study scheduled.  
\* I've gotten a nutritionist since my last post but so far our options are limited because I can't get out of bed and don't have a reliable caregiver who can shop for me--I'm on SNAP which means I have to be physically present at the store.

Again, any insight or help would be immensely appreciated. We're all so lost.",43.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1ns65lr/update_been_bedbound_sick_for_4_months_doctor_has/,IiteraIIy,2025-09-27 13:58:07,34.0,post,,,

I have not had an eye examination but an ophthalmologist is on the list for referrals.

These were the notes written in the chart from the Head CT:

1. An air-fluid level is demonstrated in the right maxillary sinus. In the appropriate clinical setting this could represent active right maxillary sinusitis.  
2. Otherwise unremarkable, unenhanced head CT. No intracranial pathology is demonstrated.

I have not been diagnosed with POTS but my doctor suspects it. I have not had an ECG/EKG on while changing positions, but the cardiologist had me sit/stand with a basic pulse/o2 monitor and noticed a change in heart rate and blood pressure. However this isn't consistent, it seems to like to disappear anytime I'm actually having a conclusive test done, haha. I think that my anxiety also sometimes influences my bp/hr and makes the results really inconsistent.

I have tried asking for a tilt table test and the cardiologist just outright refuses saying it won't provide anything useful.",2.0

AskDocs,fatty liver,1nptuzc,very concerned! weird GI issues,"Hi!

I am a 26 yr old female with history of obesity and pcos.  Ive been having yellow colored stool for years with maybe some upper abdominal bloating. I read that fatty liver can cause those symptoms especially since my stool isn't usually greasy-looking like it might be in pancreatitis. I will also admit that I also have had very poor diet the past few years that I am working on to eat healthier. I am also currently trying to lose weight and is on zepbound (my condition has not worsened since started the med). My blood work has all been normal (both pancreatic and liver enzymes) but my CRP and IgA is very high but not the celiac specific marker. Maybe very rare occasional upper abdominal dull pain/cramping but no other symptoms than that. I do have an appointment with a GI doctor but couldn't get an earlier appointment than December. Does anyone have any ideas on maybe what's going on? Could it be NAFLD? Thank you <3

AskDocs,fatty liver,1nppam7,"Ovarian cyst, Peritoneal inclusion cyst, or hydrosalpinx, I am confused!","Hello, I have a question about a situation I am currently facing. I am working with a healthcare provider I just need some outside perspective to try and prepare myself for what could happen. I also tried to post this on another subreddit but I found this one after the fact.

So this started at the end of July this year, they incidentally found what they thought was an ovarian cyst that was measured to be 7.1cm x 4.8 cm x 3.2 or something close to that. I had an MRI, after I had an Ultrasound, because they want to do surgery and it came back saying that it is not an ovarian cyst but could be a peritoneal inclusion cyst or a hydrosalpinx. I do not have conditions that make me at risk for developing these and I have not had surgery that could put me at risk of adhesions. I am kind of freaked out thinking what I thought was going to be a simple cyst removal could now be more invasive/ fallopian tube removal. I could use some perspective on how this could have happened or if they could be wrong about this not being an ovarian cyst.

Some background on me for context (might not all be relevant to my current situation) I am 28-year-old woman; I take albuterol PRN and use Excedrin PRN for migraines. I have a fatty liver I am dealing with and possible PCOS as well from the images on the MRI that I am planning to have further investigated. I have a medical hx of IBS and have had colon polyps removed, I also have Scoliosis. But other than that I am healthy.

Thank you if you read through this post I appreciate it.

AskDocs,fatty liver,1npouxs,"Swollen lymph nodes in neck, measuring 1 cm","Background: 32F with sudden weight gain (15 pounds in 2 months) despite no change in exercise and diet. Had successfully lost 75+ pounds after having my second child. Was weighing 145 for a year+ until sudden weight gain. Now at 160. Still strength train regularly. 

Symptoms: weight gain; neck discomfort, extreme fatigue; occasional headaches, night sweats and hot flashes. Thought I was experiencing pre menopause. Began in November 2024 but went to doctor in April/May 2025. 

Abnormal labs - low wbc, low rbc, high mpv, low alt, low alkaline phosphate; high carbon dioxide, low hemoglobin, low hematocrit. 
Normal TSH and T4Free; but high TPO antibodies. Normal iron and ferritin, vitamins. 

After exam with PCP, doctor noted enlarged thyroid and lymph nodes. Requested ultrasounds - done in August. 

Thyroid U/S reading: Real-time linear scans throughout the thyroid gland shows good visualization of the thyroid gland with mildheterogeneous echotexture. The right thyroid lobe measures 5.3 x 1.6 x 1.4 cm. The left thyroid lobe measures 5.3 x 1.7 x 1.6 cm. The isthmus measures 3.9 mm. No definite solid nodule is identified. Color Doppler evaluation of the thyroid gland shows no hypervascular lesions.

Neck soft tissue U/S reading: igh resolution contact scans of the neck was performed, focusing on the area of concern. Multiple prominent hypoechoic lymph nodes are observed in the soft tissues of the neck. The largest lymph node measures 1.1 x 0.3 x 0.7 cm on the right and 2.6 x 0.7 x 1.1 cm on the left. No nodal suppuration.

Separate ultrasound for unrelated (I think) issue noted an enlarged + fatty liver.  

Referred to ENT + Endo. ENT prescribed steroid and antibiotic + CT scan. 

I requested labs for EBV - initial and repeat both came back elevated Igg, Igm, ag ab igg, and early d antigen igg. Completed in August and a month later. 

This, despite anti inflammatory diet (no gluten, dairy or eggs) and 1 month of taking l-lysine, Monolaurin, selenium, milk thistle, b12, zinc, multivitamin. 

CT readings from today: 
1. Nonspecific shotty bilateral cervical lymph nodes. A left level 2 lymph node does approach short axis size criteria for enlargement 1.0 cm. Correlate clinically for potential causes of nodal enlargement. Sampling could be considered as clinically appropriate.  2. Additional findings as above.
Narrative
Exam: CT soft tissue neck was performed with and without IV contrast. Sagittal and coronal reformats. 50 mL of Visipaque 320 was given intravenously.  INDICATION: Lymphadenitis.  COMPARISON: Head and neck ultrasound July 30, 2025 demonstrating multiple cervical lymph nodes measuring up to 6 mm in short axis.  DLP: 335.13.  FINDINGS:  There are multiple shotty lymph nodes bilaterally within the neck. A left level 2A lymph node approaches short axis size criteria for enlargement at approximately 1.0 cm (series 8 image 32). No nodal suppuration or abscess formation is identified. No nodal mineralization is seen.  The parotid and submandibular glands appear unremarkable. There is mild heterogenicity of the thyroid which is suboptimally characterized on CT examination (thyroid ultrasound July 30, 2025 reveals a mildly heterogeneous thyroid--correlate with endocrinology consultation and relevant laboratory values).  The internal jugular veins are opacified into the chest. Bilateral common carotid and cervical internal carotid arteries appear patent.  The epiglottis is not thickened.  No apical focal consolidation is identified.  Scant nonspecific fluid/stranding within the mediastinum.  No acute fracture or focally destructive osseous lesions identified. Mild degenerative changes the visualized osseous structures (for example about the atlantoaxial articulation).

I realize this is A LOT! But we have few specialists where I’m at and it’s been a challenge to get answers. My DO doesn’t seem to have any - just refers me out. Appreciate any thoughts!

AskDocs,fatty liver,1npouxs,"Swollen lymph nodes in neck, measuring 1 cm",,,,drpiglizard,2025-09-24 16:51:51,,comment,ng1fszm,"Okay so there's a bit going on here. Let's walk through it.

- You have an abnormal thyroid with an enlarged isthmus by width (or is that depth?). With a raised TPO and normal TFTs. 

- You have some mildly enlarged lymph nodes in the neck on one side. Nil else on CT.

- You have an active EBV infection (acute vs reactivation). Raised IgG, IgM, and EA D IgG. This would explain your night sweats and malaise/fatigue/lymphanopathy. 

- You have anaemia but I can't comment on severity with normal iron. It may be heamolytic. 

Questions: 

- What is the thyroid history in your family? What were the actual TFT numbers? Have you had any previous TFTs that we can compare to?

- Did they include an EBNA-1 IgG? What is your reticulocyte level? What is your bilirubin? Did you have a coobs test or an LDH test? What is your platelet level?

Differential:

- EBV (chronic vs acute) with possible resultant autoimmune heamolytic anaemia (depending on the above results).

- Subclinical Hashimoto's disease (normal TFTs, raised TPO, enlarged isthmus); EBV may also be linked to the development of autoimmune thyroid disease.

- Other causes of enlarged thyroid and lymph nodes (though less likely considering what we know) should also be considered.

Plan:

- I would complete the tests mentioned above that have not been done.
- Consider FNA of the nodes mentioned. This would be via ENT.
- Endocrinology input should be sought.",4.0

(FDs is family doctors, relatives.)


You can read from my previous posts. I found out I had mobile cholesterol gallstones(no symptoms) . FDs had me check if they had moved, no, CBD was clear we got ultrasound twice. I have fatty liver grade 2-3. My LFT showed AST, ALT, and GGT to be 82,164 and 106 , respectively. Rest everything is normal . The FDs said that no surgery can be done my liver will go to failure. The surgeon is FDs friend. But to me, The surgeon said he’ll do the surgery and its all fine. The gastro gave the surgeon a green signal saying enzymes are from fatty liver. The surgeon told me to repeat LFT for 3rd time. in the evening the FDs told me i’m doomed and dead in years. They said i’ll have to drop another year then get my stomach removed part (to stop fatty liver from escalating) and then GB too. Because fatty liver is irreversible. ITS FUCKING NOT. 

next day they said its reversible but did the same fear mongering. I was TERRIFIED AND BEGGING THEM SOBBING! They said this is the only way to fix it (Wait for months to lower enzymes with meds- bariatric surgery- GB removal- months recovery). But TODAY. they’re saying i will go off to college and lose weight there. Then return after 6 months to get my GB removed. I asked what about the risk of the stones moving?? They said we have to take that risk. And they kept telling me I cant do it i dont have the will power because i havent done it till now. I WAS FUCKING SUICIDAL SINCE YEARS. Its only now that i’m healing from therapy. Help! I know this sounds messy but thats exactly how it is in my head!  I have no one and they refusing to let me take a second opinion saying everything will be the same. I want to know what my actual position in! I will lose weight regardless.

There may be some residual scarring, but you'll likely have enough working parenchyma and it will partly regenerate.

Risks with surgery and fatty liver isn't liver failure, it is purely technical. Big liver makes surgery more difficult. 

Do the bariatric surgery first. After that gall surgery is optional. If you still don't have symptoms you don't have to.

AskDocs,fatty liver,1nj3yzo,What does VBI mean?,"I've had lots of strange symptoms and tests based on the abbreviated history fit within an office visit.  I didn't know which parts were important and which weren't and always got cut off.  Now I've been given the names of several arteries and percentage of blockage but frankly I have no idea what to do with that information.  Do I have VBI or not?  Have I always had it?  What is the treatment for it?  Who do I see for treatment?  Is my son at risk?

Neurovascular surgeon wouldn't say and did the workup as ""nonsymptomatic"" because he saw me for about 30 seconds and didn't ask me about any symptoms, and he had a student do the angiogram.  Just said ""treatment is medical"" and did not explain what that means.

I wonder if we can look at the history and see any kind of explanation for lifelong symptoms that remain unexplained.  Pretty sure I didn't have atherosclerosis at age 4.  Also pretty sure triglycerides weren't high at age 4.  

I did not tolerate statins. They caused muscle pain including chest pain which went away after stopping them.  My cholesterol has never actually been bad.  HDL was a bit lower than they would like.  Triglycerides were \~250 in my 20s, over 1000 now.  Mildly anemic.  Symptoms that actually matter to my quality of life are  gait problems, neurogenic bowel and bladder, speech problems, falling down, thigh pain waking me up every night.  The Bethanechol had been working great for neurogenic bladder, but as soon as I started taking the triglyceride lowering meds, the Bethanechol stopped being effective.  That is a really big quality of life problem and I don't even know if lower triglycerides will help me live longer.  Physical therapy always helps but new neurologic symptoms keep appearing in therapy.  Therapist gets nervous, cancels appointments, refers me to PCP who has no idea what to do.  I don't know if its safe to exercise or not.  I use a used power wheelchair on bad days so I don't fall (ever since I fell on top of my walker and nearly crushed a small kid). I walk with a cane on good days.  I want to know if there is any way to avoid triggering these episodes of falling, slurring, brain fog.

AskDocs,fatty liver,1nefro0,Palpable painless lymph nodes in the neck since 2021 (24M),"5’6, 150 pounds, somewhat lean

Hello,

I have had these palpable lymph nodes (multiple) on the left side of my neck for a while, from what I can tell at least. If I had to take a guess they would be superior cervical lymph nodes. I can move some and some stay as it. They don’t seem very big, around the tip of my thumb if I had to take a guess. But regardless I’ve been worried about them for the past 2-3 weeks. For background, I’ve had them ultrasound-ed around 3-4 times from when I found them (mid 2021 after my second Covid vax) and early 2022.

I moved into a new apartment 2 weeks ago and have been sweating somewhat at night as well(since I moved, I changed my mattress and duvet which could be it maybe?). I had some bowel/gut issues prior to that which made me think of colon cancer but those issues seemed to have resolved themselves. Over the past 2 months I have had bloodwork done which came out normal except liver enzymes being elevated then going back down promptly, my A1C was on the high side (5.7) but other than that my HGB was normal (135-141, it has been around that range for the past 3 years). RBCs are also normal but a bit on the low end and WBCs have been between 6 to 7.7 (A bit worrying). My doctor seems to think I am fine and doesn’t want to send me for an ultrasound. 

I also had a cervical X ray in June due to some nerve issues, alongside an ultrasound and X ray of my right hand (inflamed nerve), an X ray of my chest which came out clear, a abdominal x ray which showed some fecal load (they did this to rule out impacted stool when I started having bowel issues), an abdominal ultrasound to see if I have fatty liver (the ultrasound was normal all around) and an abdominal CT which also came back normal. Admittedly I do have a bit of health anxiety but I can’t stop thinking about lymphoma because of the lymph nodes. I feel like one of the lymph nodes might also be virchow’s node.

Any advice would be helpful, thanks.

AskDocs,fatty liver,1n9gteb,"Please, please help.","Male

72 years old

Non smoker

History of prostate cancer (10 years ago, successfully treated, patient ended up with urostomy.

Recent bout of urosepsis (hospital stay of 3 weeks)

Hi everyone, 

This is my second post, as I didn’t receive any comments on the first.  I am truly hoping someone will reach out this time. You have no idea how much it would help!

My uncle has been feeling unwell for about two months. He has been a patient of his current GP for decades and will not consider the opinions of anyone but him. While he is a good doctor, recent events have my entire family worried.

My uncle was signed for a CAT scan with contrasting of the abdomen about 10 days ago. I am attaching the report that came back. His GP met with him and told him he “thinks” he might have liver cancer. He gave my uncle the option of being referred to our local cancer center, or staying with him as a patient. My uncle trusts this man and so was not referred to an oncologist.

Can someone please read this report and tell me if I am crazy? When I read this, I am seeing metastatic cancer, which has spread to his liver, his abdominal lining, and the lymph nodes near his vena cava. 

His GP is literally telling him he might have liver cancer. That’s it. No more elaboration than that. 

My uncle also is experiencing ascites now, and his abdomen is swollen and hard as a rock. He is having laboured breathing, and can barely get out of bed. His GP set up another ultrasound and a paracentesis for today, but the hospital sent him home because the GP had not arranged for follow up care. Now he is stuck waiting until Monday to have his abdomen drained. 

He finally agreed to be referred to an oncologist, but the cancer centre told us he won’t have an appointment until they biopsy him. They did not explain what type of biopsy this would be. Is it possible they will simply assess the abdominal fluid? Will they be able to determine what type of cancer he has from the drained Ascites fluid?

I will attach his original CAT scan here.

Please, if some kind soul could read this report and answer just a few of my questions I would be eternally grateful. We are finding it so difficult to get straight answers. Your opinion would mean so much!!

Thank you!

AskDocs,fatty liver,1n9gteb,"Please, please help.",,,,JustCalIMeDave,2025-09-05 14:10:12,,comment,ncmj3xo,"Based on the report it seems he has evidence of cancer as you stated. It is not clear whether the cancer originates in his liver, or somewhere else. A biopsy is necessary to determine the type of cancer and what the treatment would indicate. Rarely draining the fluid can provide enough cells to make a specific diagnosis. But this is very rare. Almost always an actually tissue biopsy is needed. 

Usually the patient has a whole body scan of some sorts and then the lesion most easily accessible is chosen as the biopsy site. 

It is a bit silly for the oncologist not to offer an appointment until a biopsy is made. 

At this point I recommend a few things:
1. Yourself or somebody else should accompany him to his next few appointments. Some of what you are saying doesn't add up exactly and I am concerned there is some misunderstandings going on. 
2. I recommend getting him in to see an oncologist somehow. Call the office and insist on an appointment. Call another oncologists office and see if they can fit you in. Or call the GP and say the oncologist office is giving you the run around and see if he can help make you an appointment. 
3. Have a frank and thorough discussion with your uncle about his goals of care. What is his quality of life like now? What quality of life is acceptable to him? What is he willing to go through to retain that quality of life? Would he want chemotherapy? What about a major surgery? 

At that point you should have enough information to help him make important decisions about his medical care. Hope that helps",9.0
AskDocs,fatty liver,1n9gteb,"Please, please help.",,,,MeowyMeowerson,2025-09-05 14:22:17,,comment,ncmlfhh,"Bless you for taking the time to read and respond to this. You truly have no idea how much it means.

You are correct, there has been a lot of misunderstanding …. Mostly because his GP did not feel the need to refer him to an oncologist. It has been a week now since his GP first shared this report with him and told him he is 95% sure he has liver cancer. He emphatically insisted it was not cancer from any other part of the body.

Though in this report, the cancerous areas are said to be metastatic. Doesn’t that mean they originated somewhere other than the site they are showing? Also, doesn’t metastasis like this automatically stage him as level four? 

I assume the oncologist told them he won’t see him until the biopsy is done, so they can be sure the type of cancer, where it originated, and if it can be treated. 

My uncle is a grumpy old man (in the best way) and to be truthful with you, I don’t know if he would accept treatment if the odds were low, or if the treatment was going to make him sicker. He was once a tall, strong man who was used to doing everything on his own. He has spent the last month in bed, barely eating and unable to walk a few feet without shortness of breath and exhaustion.

I am more worried for my aunt, who is beside herself and cannot even consider losing him. Neither one of them understand, medical terminology, or procedures very well.

I have a medical background, and also spent four weeks in palliative care watching my precious father waste away with pancreatic cancer.  I know the road we’re about to be traveling, if I understand this report correctly.

Again, thank you so very much for your input. I will follow your advice. If there is anything else you’d like to add, please feel free. ❤️",5.0
AskDocs,fatty liver,1n9gteb,"Please, please help.",,,,JustCalIMeDave,2025-09-05 14:45:13,,comment,ncmps8g,"The thing I was trying to get at, is that the only reason I can think of for why the GP would not refer him initially is that he has a discussion with your uncle about how this is likely a terminal diagnosis, and your uncle being a very independent person, had decided not to pursue treatment or diagnosis, but to stay with the GP for palliative treatment. I can't imagine the GP planning to prescribe him chemotherapy himself. 

That means either your uncle didn't understand what the GP was saying, or your uncle is doing a poor job of communicating that decision to you. 

Also to answer your other questions, yes it's automatically stage 4 if it is indeed cancer. And no you can't tell for sure, but it is probably from the liver. They can originate in the liver but be metastatic to other sites such as he peritoneum.",3.0
AskDocs,fatty liver,1n9gteb,"Please, please help.",,,,MeowyMeowerson,2025-09-05 16:20:59,,comment,ncn6jrg,"Thank you again. I wish I could say that my uncle had a Frank discussion with his GP in which the doctor was honest with him about the likelihood of a terminal diagnosis.

Unfortunately, this is not the case.  My aunt was with my uncle during all of the appointments, including the first reading of this CT scan.

My uncle even commented to my aunt today , “maybe once they drain my abdomen, they’ll see it’s not actually cancer.” He is not in denial, it’s just that the doctor has not been clear and concise about the report. 

His GP has a considerable reputation in our area. He is very intelligent, a brilliant doctor. …. But also extremely arrogant and possesses a difficult bedside manner. I think this is playing into my uncle’s diagnosis, as his GP seems to think he knows better than an oncologist and convinced my uncle of this. It has been 10 days now since the report came out, and my uncle has received no form of treatment, no biopsy, no paracentesis, no admission, no consultation with an oncologist.

All because his GP has insisted on handling things. 

Luckily, after being forced to admit he’d made a mistake and did not set up the proper procedures for my uncle to receive his paracentesis today, he finally sent a referral to the cancer center. 

I think his GP failed him on many levels, and despite my attempts to  provide more clarity for my aunt and uncle….. They are both very much in the dark about the seriousness of whats to come. 

I agree with you that it is silly for the oncology department to want a biopsy before they set up an appointment with him. There are many resources he could be taking advantage of even before the biopsy is done. I don’t understand what they’re thinking…..

Again, I am so very grateful for your response. Your advice regarding having a conversation about the future and what may come is invaluable. This is a heavy subject that my uncle should have time to weigh and come to terms with.",2.0
AskDocs,fatty liver,1n65vki,Cause for concern or just an abnormality,"I’m 25 and female.   Recently went to the ER thinking I was having a heart attack, they determined it was just GERD and sent me home.   I wasn’t really happy with that answer since it felt like I was dying but that was a couple weeks ago and I lived.   I like to be informed about my health though and decided to look up the results from all my tests and found a lot of things outside normal ranges that correlate with the liver.   I’ve had a few friends look at it (I’m a CNA and work with a lot of nurses) with varying levels of concern.   One thinks it’s fatty liver, another thinks hepatitis, and one thinks it’s gallbladder issues.   I’m not on any prescription medication but I do have headaches and take ibuprofen a few times a week. Gall bladder issues concerns me because of family history of gallstones and cancer.   
I can’t say I’m having any major symptoms.   I have a feeling of lot of mucus in my throat that’s been there for a year, random stomach pains and nausea that’s manageable, fatigue that’s been there my whole life.   I don’t feel good but I never have so it’s hard to really tell if I should be concerned and make the appointment with my PCP and the hematologist he wants me to see since my WBC has been high for over a year or just wait it out and save the money that multiple specialists will cost me

Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. I haven't seen a correlation to this and hypoglycemia online, but PUTTIN' IT IN HERE ANYWAYS

I'm flying next week. I've been dealing with severe low blood sugar the last month while trying to get my weight back to a more managable level after two weeks of battling sugar crashes in the evening put me into a vicious cycle (sugar crashes -> cereal or toast and jam in the evening -> body seems to overproduce insulin the next day which tanked my sugars -> cereal or toast and jam in the evening -> too much insulin the next day which tanked my sugars. Repeat for two weeks and suddenly I'm up TEN KILOS.

Finally broke the cycle of nightly sugar crashes by having just a bit of sugar in the morning or afternoon and going just off carbs/protein/vegetables the rest of the day. This helped and I lost 4 kilos in a week. However, if I do any physical activity in the evening (working out or walking), my sugars bomb pretty severely. Fully shaking, light headed, cold sweats, etc. I'm hoping the added poundage has been what has been triggering these almost daily crashes and it'll be much better once I get my weight back down to 115 kilos. However, I did not have these issues when I moved to Germany and I was 135kg.

The crashes themselves: If my blood sugar is 75-90 mg/dl or 4.2-5 mmol/l, I get dizzy and lightheaded, severe problems with concentration, cold sweats and bad fatigue. Bad time all around. I can take a couple of glucose pills/eat something/juice to combat it like would be expected, but it's a miserable time. I struggle hard to get my blood sugars above 100 mg/dl, even two hours after eating a carb heavy meal.

Now, aside from this crap apparently being impossible for a doctor to diagnose because my fasting blood sugars seem perfectly normal (Me having issues with low blood sugar was flat-out denied by my GP, who believes SPORT MACHEN (doing physical activities) and cortisone shots are the solution to everything), I have this constant... werid sensation in my throat/base of my skull. Like a crackling, staticy feeling. I've had this on and off most of my life (same with blood sugar issues), but it's been CONSTANT for two weeks now. That + thirsty + general fatigue. It's super hard to motivate myself to work out when I feel this awful and I've taken to pre-emptively taking glucose pills before I walk to prevent the crashes from being severe, because if I don't work out, I HAVE to walk at least 5 kilometers a day, just to help bring the weight down.

Next week I'm flying to the USA for 3 weeks and this has been a serious point of concern for me the entire time. The trip cannot be delayed for any reason due to a personal obligation and I've lost faith in my current doctor (trying for a new one in October, as well as a new gym regime). My big question at the end of this spiel is: Is it likely I'm going to have issues while flying specifically? I lived in Canada before moving to Germany 3 years ago, so I know getting sugar when I need it in North America is not exactly going to be a problem and I'll need to absolutely behave when it comes to my diet over there. But I'm concerned about whether or not being on an airplane will make this problem even worse.

Will I have circulation issues? Compression socks needed? I can't find any answer online and the only diabetes that exists when you google flying is HIGH blood sugar.",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1n47qux/flying_with_apparent_chronic_hypoglycemia/,Cappabitch,2025-08-30 10:42:45,7.0,post,,,

*  Nodular hepatic contour concerning for underlying chronic liver disease/cirrhosis. Clinical and biochemical workup is recommended for correlation and etiology. Additionally, there is heterogenous hypodense appearance within the right lobe of the liver affecting segments 6 and 7. An underlying hepatic mass at this location should be ruled out. Further assessment with hepatic ultrasound [with Doppler assessment] and hepatic MRI are recommended. 
*  Nonspecific millimetric pulmonary nodules. Given the provided clinical history a low dose follow-up CT chest is recommended in 3-6 months for reassessment. 
*  Right thyroid nodule measuring 2.1 cm, incompletely assessed on CT. Further assessment with thyroid ultrasound is recommended.

However, it can be seen in the setting of recurrent or chronic bowel inflammation such as underlying inflammatory bowel disease.

AskDocs,fatty liver,1mzamg1,"I need help understanding how liver damage works, please?","31F. Diagnosed with OCD, GAD, and depression. Currently unmedicated. I wanted to ask as a general question about how this works.

To my understanding, the stages are something like fatty liver, alcoholic hepatitis, early cirrhosis, end stage cirrhosis. I've read that cirrhosis often goes undetected at first.

If someone has undetected early cirrhosis, then never drinks again, I know the liver won't repair, but does their lifespan go back to normal? Will the liver stop getting worse? Or is that it, once it's that bad you won't last more than 10 years or so?

If a person with cirrhosis were to drink say once every 6 months, do they risk the liver failing each time they drink, even just a few drinks? And how does liver failure present - does someone just wake up yellow and visibly dying one day?

How resilient can the liver be? Is it possible to drink heavily for a decade and not have put myself in an early grave already? Mental health has been at its worst for a long time, currently waiting to be registered at GP to get help. But I'm trying to form healthier habits and have gone from daily drinking to just weekends. It's something I guess.

I sometimes experience a dull pain in my upper right abdomen, particularly when drinking. I've noticed it less since cutting back. People have noticed I look better since cutting back on drinking (I didn't tell them I had been). I often feel bloated but stomach is wobbly, no ascites. I sometimes wake up feeling like I have palpitations. I've noticed occasionally just the front part of my feet swell slightly but I've seen pictures of oedema and it looks nothing like that, possibly circulation? No yellow skin/eyes. Stool is normal. I know only a blood test can give definitive results but I'm waiting to be registered so not currently an option. Is there any hope for me to have a somewhat normal future?

AskDocs,fatty liver,1ms31sg,"For 3+ months I’ve had severe nausea, hypersensitive gag reflex, weight loss (~25lbs), and stomach sickness.","**TL;DR:** For 3+ months I’ve had severe nausea, hypersensitive gag reflex, weight loss (\~25lbs), and stomach sickness.

* **Tests:** CT (colon inflammation), ultrasound (fatty liver), endoscopy/colonoscopy (hiatal hernia, dismissed), gastric emptying (normal), thyroid fluctuations.
* **Doctors:** GI insists it’s reflux/anxiety → put me on Voquezna. Surgeon says the hiatal hernia *is significant* and may need surgery (tests pending).
* **Meds:** Zoloft, Bupropion, Zofran (inconsistent), Voquezna (no help), Mirtazapine (helps gag reflex).
* **Status:** Still nauseous daily, gagging often, appetite gone, feeling completely defeated and stuck between conflicting opinions.

**Timeline:** 

**Early May** \- One random night I got super nauseous and got very hot and shaky. I then threw up. A few hours later I felt better

**Mid May** \- On my flight to Japan, my girlfriend mentioned she was nauseous, this made me anxious because I have a horrible fear of vomiting. I then started to get extremely nauseous and started gagging uncontrollably. The days after in Japan I was horribly nauseous with diarrhea. I was unable to eat food due to fear of getting sick again, so I kept to very simple and bland foods (rice, bread, plain proteins) but was trying to hydrate 

**Early June** \- I got back from Japan and was feeling better. One night I went out with my family for dinner and when we got back home I threw up everything I ate. The days following I was again hit with horrible nausea, stomach sickness, diarrhea and gagging uncontrollably.

I went to my GI and she suggested I get an ultrasound. That weekend I ended up in the hospital because I couldn't take the nausea anymore. They did a CT scan and it showed my colon was inflamed. I was diagnosed with colitis and given antibiotics. Days after, I got the ultrasound results back  and it all looked ok, they did however say my liver looked a little fatty

**Mid June** \- I went back to the GI and she suggested getting a colonoscopy and endoscopy. I got both of those done, with biopsies and they looked ok. She did however mention I have a hiatal hernia but completely dismissed it and told me not to worry about it.

My GI was convinced the issue was related to acid reflux so she prescribed me Voquenza. I had to ask her to run more tests like gastric emptying, to see if it could shine light on what's going on. She brushed this off and told me I could do it if I wanted to, but there was nothing else she could do for meMy GP suggested cutting out dairy, gluten, and soy. I was tested for celiac disease and it was negative

**Late June** \- Symptoms come and go like before.

**Early July** \- After 4th of July I had a horrible nausea and gagging episode. I thought it could have been because of what I ate on the 4th. Again for many days after that episode, I was battling bad nausea, gagging, and stomach sickness

**Mid July -** I went to the hospital again because I started feeling intense pain in my stomach. The hospital gave me Reglan for the nausea, I had a horrible reaction to it.The ER doctor said that the vomiting and nausea was most likely from Anxiety (I felt so horribly misunderstood). I did agree that my general anxiety condition and fear of vomiting made things worse, but it was in no way causing all of this.I started seeing a thyroid doctor because blood work I got in late July showed some of my levels were off. The thyroid doctor had me retake the blood work to see if there was a trend. I included both work ups in this post.

**Late July** \- I went to an esophagus surgeon thinking she was a motility specialist. At this appointment she revealed to me that what my GI dismissed as something not to worry about (the hernia) was actually a big deal and could be causing a lot of what I was feeling.

She scheduled a few tests for me to take to see if surgery would help. At the time of writing this I have not taken these tests yet but they are scheduled and I am trying to get them done as fast as possible. She also said I should stick to a strict FODMAP diet. I have tried but I admit I cheat sometimes. I drink coke because it helps with the gag reflex but I know it’s not good for FODMAP. I have however never cheated on gluten, dairy, soy, or oily foods. I avoid those

**Early August** \- Symptoms seemed to calm down a bit. I thought I was getting better. I had my Gastric emptying test and it came back ok

**Mid August** \-  I went back to the thyroid doctor and was happy to tell her I seemed to have gotten better. She had me repeat the blood work one more time to ensure things were ok. My levels looked to have stabilized and because I was feeling better she suggested getting tested again in 3 months with no need for a follow up appointment. The day after that, my nausea came back in full swing. I have gotten to the point where I am beyond defeated and don’t know what to do.

Tests taken:

* Early June - CT Scan - showed inflamed colon
* Early June - Ultrasound - everything looked ok but liver slightly fatty
* Mid June - Colonoscopy / endoscopy - showed hernia in my throat but nothing else
* Mid June - Blood work -  showed very low vitamin D, High calcium, Bad cholesterol, and Thyroid levels off (attached below)
* Mid July -  Blood work -  vitamin D got better, Calcium got slightly worse, Thyroid stayed about the same (Attached below)
* Early August -  Gastric Emptying - looked ok
* Mid August -  Blood work -  Calcium got better, Thyroid stabilized (I don’t have access to this blood work

**Symptoms:**

* Nausea - Extremely common / comes and goes ranges from 1-10 in intensity
* Gag reflex - Extremely common / very heightened feels like I need to throw up but most of the time nothing comes up
   * Diarrhea - more common than the Vomiting, but still not super common
   * Constipation - I was constipated for a few weeks but then it went away
   * Sick feeling - common in the mid to upper stomach
   * Pain uncommon but occurs in the mid to upper stomach
   * Feeling very hot -  I assume this is from the anxiety? It often comes with the nausea

AskDocs,fatty liver,1mqu923,Recently diagnosed with Hypertension.,"I had incidentally checked my bp and found it was north of 160/100mm hg. This was alarming and I went to my physician to get it checked. He checked my pressure himself and said it recorded 176/110 mm hg. I'm 5 foot 7 inches and weighs 93 kilos as of yesterday. I used to be lean and athletic but post an injury I had abstained from sports and saw a drastic weight gain during the covid period which I was unable to shed . I also have grade 3 fatty liver and my HbA1c is around 7.5 which again reflects poor metabolic health. I have enrolled myself at a gym aiming to reduce my weight by around 10 kilos with the help of a personal trainer. The doc I visited prescribed bisoprolol 5 mg for two months once daily and advised weight loss of about 10-15 kgs in the next two motnths. I am a doc myself and have never heard of beta blockers being prescribed as a first line drug particularly in young adults. To my knowledge we usually prescribe ACEI/ARB's as first line drugs in young adults and use CCb's if it's not controlled. I asked him the same and he said thavt we usually prescribe beta blockers since there seems to be great improvement. I checked the latest guidelines and did not find evidence pertaining to the fact. I've purchased the medicine but I'm kind of skeptical about taking it. I did read somewhere that usually bisoprolol is prescribed with lifestyle modification. Also since I'm young shoudn't I rule out secondary hypertension? Can any fellow doctors help me make sense of this?
 
Edit - I got a 2 d echo and got my bp checked again. It was 130/80 mm Hg and the echo was normal. The cardiologist said I should get an ambulatory bp monitoring next week and to not take bisoprolol till then.

AskDocs,fatty liver,1mnop6h,How do I get a parent to go to the doctor (liver issues)?,"Hi all, I am 23F and have a single parent, early 50sM. My Dad is obese, his mom died from Non Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease, and he is also anti-western medicine to clarify before I ask for advice. 

My Dad for the past year has been dealing with stomache issues that have been getting worse and worse. He has mild bloating and discomfort in his abdomen by his liver, he has stomache discomfort especially with certain foods like gluten and dairy, and he throws up a lot. I also have observed some jaundice but he claims he has none and its just his skin shade (he’s brown so it is hard to tell). His stomache issues are getting worse and worse and he refuses to go to the doctor because “all they are gonna tell me to do is eat healthier and I already know that”. He hasn’t had a check up in about 3 years, and at his last check up he did have a fatty liver that was “elevated but not concerning” according to him. He was obese then and has still gained a lot of weight so I’m assuming it is probably worse now, but there is no way of knowing because he refuses to go get it checked.

I have tried everything, I have brought up the fact that liver disease is serious and deadly if not caught in time, that I am 23 and he will miss my marriage and first born, that I will have to be the one to take care of him because there is no one else around…. nothing works and nothing will get him to the hospital, to eat better, or to exercise. So I guess for advice I am asking 1. Are these common general obesity symptoms, or am I right to be concerned that the liver is involved? and 2. How do I convince him to get a check up?

AskDocs,fatty liver,1mmhw97,Am I understanding this CT correctly? (Cirrhosis),"40/M, two years sober.

Diagnosed with cirrhosis in 2023. 

Annual CT to check for cancer.

Trying to compare my CT from last week to my CT from last year. Doc only calls to discuss if there’s bad news, and this looks promising.

XX | 2024 | 2025

Liver | cirrhotic. No steatosis | borderline cirrhotic. No steatosis 

Liver lesions | no suspicious hepatic lesions identified | none

Varices | none | small splenic varices

Spleen | splenomegaly | enlarged 17.2 cm

Conclusion | hepatic cirrhosis, splenomegaly suggests portal hypertension | borderline cirrhosis with sequela of portal hypertension. No suspicious hepatic lesions

So the main questions are:

- what is “borderline cirrhotic”? 
- does no steatosis mean that I no longer have fatty liver?
- what’s the difference between splenomegaly and enlarged spleen?
- does sequela just mean - it looks good now but you have lingering effects from how bad it was before?

AskDocs,fatty liver,1mmhw97,Am I understanding this CT correctly? (Cirrhosis),,,,DeucesHigh,2025-08-12 02:53:32,,comment,n89g6u9,"\- Borderline cirrhotic would probably mean something like, there are mild morphologic changes to the liver which wouldn't be a slam-dunk on their own but are consistent with a given clinical history of cirrhosis and/or are supported by other findings like portal hypertension.

\- No steatosis that can be seen by CT any more, noting that CT (esp. w/ contrast) is insensitive to mild steatosis. It could mean true decrease in hepatic fat (weight loss, alcohol cessation, meds) or progression of fibrosis/cirrhosis with decreasing fat.

\- Splenomegaly = enlarged spleen

\- “Sequela” means a lasting result of a prior disease or injury. In radiology it usually labels residual structural changes attributed to an earlier or chronic process, without stating whether that process is still active. For portal hypertension, splenomegaly and varices are better described as “stigmata of portal hypertension” or “findings consistent with portal hypertension,” which conveys an ongoing condition. “Sequelae"" of portal hypertension is acceptable but can be misread as leftover effects from a past problem.

Bottom line, it's likely there's no difference between the 2024 and 2025 CTs, just different wording and different things highlighted. Unclear if the splenic varices are new or not. 

Unusual to have annual (that's a long interval, 6 months is typical) surveillance with CT (that's a lot of radiation, especially if it's multi-phase which it would have to be to look for HCC). Typical is 6 month ultrasounds ± AFP, with MRI if the ultrasounds aren't good enough.",2.0

Randomly, I started getting piercing RUQ pain that would come and go mysteriously. I started noticing it after eating certain meals or laying in certain positions. Since about April, I have to run to the bathroom every morning with urgent BM which are always half digested and fatty. The pain comes more frequently and more intensely everyday with no connection anymore to what I’ve eaten or done. I wound up in the ER back in May for a particularly bad instance of it. They ran full labs (including liver and pancreas) and did a CT and everything was normal. I was then referred to my GI who told me he was fairly certain it was my gallbladder. Today I had my abdominal ultrasound (which was excruciating) and a HIDA scan. I log onto my portal and the radiologist’s findings were all normal. 

I could be jumping the gun by feeling so defeated, but my pain has been going like this for months now and getting worse by the day. I’ve recently developed these weird rashes that come and go on my hands in the evening, hot facial flushing randomly, legs falling asleep and aching for no reason, and severe back pain.

Any existing relevant medical issues IBS, fatty liver, slightly high blood pressure 

Current medications Anti depressant, Lansoprazole, statin


For about three months I’ve been experiencing serious pain in my gut. It tends to manifest as a ball that at least feels like it's moving around my intestine. I have diahorrhea maybe once a week or so too, although immodium deals with that fine.

I’ve had a pretty rigerous round of blood and stool tests with the doctor and nothing came up there - it was originally suggested it might be IBD but a second test found it wasn’t. Also had a scan on my abdoman which I’m told didn’t bring up anything of concern, apart from fatty liver (which I already knew about). I had an endocopy a while back for something else and nothing came up.

At this point my GP has effectively said they don’t know what else they can do, and have suggested some dietry changes to see if anything responds (which I’m trying, with no success so far). I’ve had IBS for years but it’s never been this bad. I take Lansoprazole 30mg twice a day but that doesn’t seem to be doing anything.

Also taking a few other meds for blood pressure, high cholesterol, and an anti depressant.

I’ve tried everything I can think of - peppermint tea, ginger green tea, ginger shots, gaviscon, buscopan, probiotic drinks and supplements, cutting out dairy - nothing seems to shift it. Any suggestions.

6'0 208 lbs.

Back about in 2019 I had an endoscopy for Acid Reflux I was having. Everything looked good btw. The dr noted I had mild fatty liver. Eventually we agreed on LPR. And famotidine was the only thing that eleviated my symtoms. So been on and off that since then. Around the same time I got diagnosed with IBS 

About a year later my liver enzymes were elevated on my physical. They asked me if I had fatty liver. I told them what my GI had noted and they didn't investigate further. Its been high since. 

Anyways, the begining of the year I have had really bad reflux in my throat and some weird urine that foams up. I went to get my physical again and asked for an ACR. Which came back with no protein in urine. And normal kidney function. And again my enzymes were high. I asked for an ultrasound/CT scan with and without contrast. Both came back normal. No masses no fatty liver, no cirrosis. i started taking my diet super serious and switched to Mediterranean. And started taking NAC and Milk Thistle. Lost about 10-15 lbs in about a couple of months as a result. Inflammation down and everything. And asked for a GI referral. And the ran their own test. And again ALT high and GGT also high. BUT my enzymes have dropped.

Seeking clarity on risk of fibrosis/cirrhosis.,"Hi all — I’m a 31-year-old male, 5’9”, with a long history of heavy alcohol use (10–15 beers/day for several years). I recently stopped drinking after a wake-up call with my labs and wanted to get an outside perspective on what I’m dealing with.

Recent labs:
	•	ALT: 174
	•	AST: 68
	•	AST/ALT ratio: ~0.39
	•	Platelets, bilirubin, albumin: all normal
	•	Glucose: 108
	•	Lipids: elevated
	•	No history of hepatitis (panel pending), but family history of fatty liver and one case of cirrhosis (grandfather)

I had normal liver labs 3.5 years ago. I’ve experienced fatigue, mild abdominal pressure (left side), and soft stools recently. My ultrasound is pending, and my PCP suspects fatty liver (potentially alcoholic or metabolic). I’m now sober, walking daily, and starting lifestyle changes.

Main concerns:
	•	Is early-stage fibrosis a likely assumption given my history?
	•	Are these levels high enough to suggest serious or permanent liver damage?
	•	How reversible might this be now that I’ve stopped drinking?
	•	What next steps should I be prepared for after the ultrasound?

I’ve been terrified by what I’ve read online and would really appreciate some perspective from the medical community. Thank you for your time and expertise.",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/1mdj0fh/31m_elevated_altast_after_heavy_alcohol_use/,Ok-Wrangler-7063,2025-07-30 14:26:25,4.0,post,,,

AskDocs,fatty liver,1mdj0fh,31M — Elevated ALT/AST after heavy alcohol use. Seeking clarity on risk of fibrosis/cirrhosis.,,,,LibraryIsFun,2025-07-30 20:27:45,,comment,n63pbx3,"No way to know without an actual evaluation. Abstinence will improve the condition of your liver regardless. With that heavy drinking, you probably have some fibrosis of your liver. 10-15 drinks is a moderately heavy amount of drinks in a week, which means you are drinking about 7x more than a moderate drinker. That means you drank what a moderate drinker like this would drink in 21 years crammed into 3 years (assuming several = 3 years). The math isn't that straightforward, since drinking a lot in a short period is far more damaging than a little spread over decades. So not terribly surprising you did some damage to your liver., but no way to know how much.

Another context would be in comparison to someone like me. I drink 3-4 drinks per week. For me to consume the same amount of alcohol you have in the past 3 years, it would take me over 50 years. 

With that said, the damage you done right now is likely (completely) reversible. You did well to stop drinking and I encourage you to continue to stop drinking. The liver is very resilient and should be able to recover from this much damage. Even if you have some irreversible fibrosis, it will not progress as long as you stay abstinent and so overall i would not be too concerned ***as long as you are abstinent***.",2.0

People who don’t drink can develop NASH. The liver is a fairly resilient organ and is capable of impressive healing. 


What I’m about to say is just the facts. Your risk will be lower if you stop drinking. You’ve demonstrated you have a problem and there’s no safe amount of alcohol for you going forward. Your risk of cirrhosis, congestive heart failure, hypertension, dementia, depression and cancer all go down when you don’t drink.

What’s done is done, but going forward making better choices will continue to reduce risk and improve your length and quality of life.",1.0

AskDocs,fatty liver,1mb1ape,Advice for husband who can't get his body under control,"Hi there,

My husband (35M, 5'9"" 240 lbs) has been struggling with health issues for a while now. He was put on blood pressure medication at a young age (20s) and was told that it was due to being overweight, having sleep apnea, and genetics. When I first met him, I thought that was strange (he has a cpap and uses it), and suggested that we ask for help to find out what the cause was. Long story short, after a lot of advocacy (from him and myself), we finally got the answer we were looking for - primary aldosteronism, caused by a benign tumor on one of his adrenal glands. We were thrilled to finally get to the bottom of this, and he had an adrenalectomy in March of this year. His blood pressure is normal again, and he is no longer on BP medication.

However, he still is facing a number of health difficulties - some of which we thought was due to the medication he was on, and others that have popped up since the procedure. About a month after the surgery, he had an acute case of pancreatitis (lipase is now back to normal). He has low testosterone (diagnosed after adrenal removal), low libido, digestive problems (bloating, belly pain), fatigue, high triglycerides, low HDL, high LDL, low vitamin D, and was recently diagnosed with a fatty liver (he doesn't drink alcohol at all). 

He is taking testosterone cypionate for the low testosterone (it's normal now). He goes on a bike ride every day, and we work out at our gym ~45 minutes 3-5 times a week, including cardio and weight training. His diet isn't perfect (lots of yogurt and bread because of his digestive problems), and he hasn't been great with taking supplements to replace what he isn't getting from food. He works from home, so he's relatively sedentary aside from the exercise I already mentioned.

We are at our wit's end. It feels like we solve one issue only for another to appear, and just the time between suspicion of primary aldosteronism to adrenalectomy took years because we weren't prepared to advocate. What might be the cause of the symptoms he's experiencing? What should we insist that his doctor check to make sure we get this taken care of ASAP? What would you suggest we do? Please let me know if any additional information would be beneficial, and I'll provide it.

Liver attenuation is diminished diffusely in keeping with steatosis. (my GP has told told me the CT scan is the worse scan and an MRI I had the month following for testicular cancer mentioned nothing about fatty liver, my ultrasound last year was fine, and all of my liver enzyme markers were fine, except bilirubin which my doc wasn't too concerned about and said repeat in 1 year. A functional MD also said it's extremely unlikely I have fatty liver.

Jul 2025: MRI Full Spine - C4-C5 2mm syrinx c4-c5 remains unchanged from 1yr prior. Had disc bulges in a lot of areas

**Complaint:**

Christmas 2024, I started getting abdominal pain, maybe 5 out of 10 with the odd 10 second bursts of sharp pains of 7/10. It would be there probably about 60% of the time...Since last month, I'd say it's gotten a bit better, maybe around 35%. The majority of the time I'd say it's better when standing but there's definitely times when I stand and have felt it. I thought it could be pudendal neuralgia, so I had a couple of pelvic floor sessions, but my insurance is running out soon, and I'd wait for other tests.

My GP didn't feel anything. First it felt like my abdomen was always wanting to tighten and most of the pain was left abdomen but definitely many times had it on the other side. Sometimes it would my pelvic area. There were a few times I noticed that If I lay on one side sometimes the discomfort would move to the side I laid on, but a lot of the times this hasn't happened. In Aug 2024, I started getting pain exclusively at the tip of my penis also if this could somehow be connected - I had a recent cystoscopy for blood in urine I get a couple times a year for decades now...and showed nothing but stricture.

I need another referral to see my colon surgeon who my GP recommends seeing over my gastro. Colon surgeon declines the referral saying my recent scans look good. My GP's office then sends to my gastro's office, and they do the same.

Since I caught a parasite in 2015, I did a stool sample test which came back with Blastocytis Hominis. I got prescribed Flagil - read quite a few posts on reddit where many have taken it and symptoms are still there and a common theme was to check with gastro, as I was concerned about my gut flora. I had a virtual appt a couple of weeks ago, and she said she doesn't think the symptoms are related but it's not the kind of antibiotic that would get rid of my gut flora.

2 weeks prior I went to the movies where the seats were really shaking me side to side for a good hr...and a few days prior, my nephew was playing this game bouncing on my stomach - but she said the timing doesn't really make sense for the pain because it would have started almost right away, and that I'd see her for my routine colonoscopy in Sep/Oct and I could be put out if the colonoscopy causes pain (never has before).

I'm someone that always believes all the scans I have gotten. Although there's a chance, I don't stress out on thinking maybe something got missed. I remembered when I got my colon cancer diagnosis that it was never picked up on that CT checking for spread. I know you need a colonoscopy unless it's a big mass. I did have an endoscopy in the summer of 2023 when almost anytime I drank it would want to come back up and I would hiccup almost every time I burped, which never happened before. That was normal.

American Cancer Society says ""CT scans can show the stomach fairly clearly and often can confirm the location of a cancer"" which was reassuring and AI says ""Yes, a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis can detect stomach cancer. It can help identify the presence, location, and extent of the cancer, and also assess if it has spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes"". On Quora, some doc said ""Yes, Most of these non-invasive studies like usg, ct or MRI can pick up stomach cancer as an abnormal thickening of the wall of stomach"".

I didn't ask, but no one has recommended a cystoscopy, and I'm not sure if I should ask/push for one? Wait till Sept/Oct and bring up the symptoms again? However, I have come across older posts on here where a few have mentioned the CT isn't great at looking at the stomach. There's only been a couple of tests I've asked for, but still I feel like every time I ask for something additional, some (not all) think it's just my anxiety -- and then what if I REALLY think I need something later. I will point out that when I explained all my symptoms to my gastro, she said she didn't think I had anything to be worried about but 'let's do one anyway'...and for my testicular cancer, the 2nd ER doc said he thought the pain was anxiety from cancer #1. My gastro is amazing and I feel like I owe my life to her...but of course, naturally, I sometimes think what if this is dejavu again....

I read the symptoms on America Cancer Society website and I have none of those, except the abdominal pain.

Thanks for your advice!

If that happened to me I’m pretty sure I’d have PTSD, and would be worried that every sensation in my body meant I had cancer. (I still sometimes think that, and I have never had cancer!) Your reaction to the issues described above is a **very** understandable hypervigilance.

But understandable though it may be, hypervigilance is not a good state to be in. Let’s look at the facts for a minute: 

- You had stage I seminoma—literally the lowest stage of the most curable cancer known to man. I’m not saying this to minimize, but to reassure. You were cured of that cancer before the surgeon even started stitching; that’s why they did not give you chemo or radiation. 
- You had stage I colon cancer, confined to a polyp. Again: cured an hour before you woke up from anesthesia. 
- Your docs treated you exactly according to standard-of-care and are currently doing all of the recommended and appropriate surveillance studies (MRI, scopes, etc), and over the past 2.5 years have not found any recurrence.
- You have sought evaluation for other issues (e.g., the endoscopy mentioned above) and the results have come back normal.

If I were in your shoes, I don’t know what I would do because I have lived a much less medically complex life than you. (Hats off, man—legit sorry you’ve been through all of this!) But I hope that I would follow a simple two-step plan:

STEP ONE (which you have already done): Find doctors I know I can trust.

and then

STEP TWO: Trust them! 

This means that I would not “push” for anything that they felt was not necessary. Because too many scans and scopes and labs and procedures, and sooner rather than later one of those suckers is going to cause you a big problem rather than solving one. It’s why we don’t do a CT scan (or even a radiation-free MRI) on every human every 6 months. They tried that in a famous trial and the people with more scans died faster, due to complications of surgeries to remove tumors that weren’t there—something you’ve personally experienced.

BONUS STEP THREE: Seek counseling for that PTSD. You’ve been through some heavy shiz, man! I’m a literal veteran of literal combat, but you could PTSD me under the table with all that you’ve experienced.

Take care of yourself, and here’s to a cancer-free next 40!",1.0

People like you are amazing...just volunteering all of your time like this is amazing. I just want to say a few things to what you said :)  

Personally, I don't think I'm often in that state of hypervigilance. I don't actually think that every symptom I get that comes up is cancer. Sure, I would be justified but I know that doesn't help.

I really try super hard to wait a few weeks, hope whatever it is goes away, before even considering to address it. Like whatever that stupid fluttering thing was has gone away. What doesn't help, of course, is that both cancers almost got missed.... I mentioned all the symptoms to my gastro blood appeared when not straining and when I would strain there would not be blood (backwards) but I suffered from constipation too which didn't help as it's not like I'd never seen blood before....and she said ""I don't think we have anything to be worried about but let's do one anyway"".... and then for the testicular cancer, I only went back because I didn't take the tylenol they wanted me to take for the pain because I felt like I wouldn't know if the pain was still there, and it's only because I had googled the CT scan for colon cancer that said 'reproductive organs - unremarkable' and it wasn't clear it covered the penis - that I went back... turns out it's prostate. Had I taken the tylenol it would have probably dulled the pain.

Also, for my syrinx, when I explained the symptoms the doc said it was likely due to anxiety, but I really wasn't that anxious... I wasn't crying or shaking or any of that... I was a little bit but nothing extreme. I found a psyiatrist that did nerve conduction studies - and I didn't even ask for one but SHE ordered a brain MRi and spine MRI and the Spine MRI came back with syringohydromyelia which 1 in 100000 people have. I was hoping that would come back with a 'trapped nerve' (what my uro onc said was possible) but it doesn't appear to - just bulging dics everywhere LOL

I appreciate what you're saying about PTSD - I might have some form of that but I found someone that's a psychologist and an MD - there's only a handful in Canada, and I see her usually like once a month. I'm lucky to have that -- although she technically could, it's not like she would order a test -- outside of medication. She's never mentioned anything like that. Certainly there's times I think about it or I'm reminded but I really do try to not let it effect me as much as possible. I'm really not in 'hypervigilance' a lot of the time, I don't think.",1.0
AskDocs,fatty liver,1m09im4,Appreciate Any Advice On Abdominal Pain - Especially Gastro's But Any Help Is Great,,,,WorriedAlternative39,2025-07-24 20:40:44,,comment,n50xejl,"Part 2:

I try to rationalize my abdominal pain to say - sure the CT scan when I had colon cancer didn't pick it up because it doesn't see polyps, but the pain started in Dec/2024 and I had a colonoscopy in Oct/2024, and for cancer to grow in 2 months doesn't make sense. Sometimes I get testicle pain on/off and I had once an ultrasound and I've learned that many guys get pain down in the other one as the other testicle has to pick up the slack.....so whenever I get pain there, I tend to believe it's just that and don't bother asking for more ultrasounds... plus that would be a completely different cancer anyway.

I'm not a fan of doing a lot of tests - the whole ""You have a new test result"" in your portal, I do get nervous at that, and I hate that. There is definitely huge value in not being overtested, so when you mention believe the Dr.s I'm pretty good at doing that. That's why I don't believe I have fatty liver because my doc said I didn't, even though the CT scan told me I did.

I still believe the doctors will be right more times than I am, and I believe what the scans say. I've just read even some docs on here that the CT doesn't see the stomach well.... and it's literally been there for almost 8 months now.....I do see the odd post here and there about someone getting pain years after surgery but most seem to be shortly after.

My psych MD said the pain could be from adhesions but then when the surgeons office said that would normally show up on CT, she agreed....and my gastro doesn't think it's related to the parasite Blasto, but says I can try it... so I will. I can't find a connection between foods I'm eating....I don't get it. The only thing that came up in my last MRI/CT that they didn't comment on before was gallstones... people on here have said usually pain is on the right but some have the pain in other areas....if I have to live with this it would suck -- it just doesn't want to go away by itself...and most of the time it isn't debilitating so I just leave it,... but naturally, sometimes I do think 'what if' and I'm just leaving it.... sure she luckily gave me the colonoscopy otherwise it would be a completely different ballgame and I'm so grateful to her - but, she didn't think anything was gonna show up, and same for the testicle....so it's just frustrating that the CT and MRI aren't real great from what I've read at picking up a stomach cancer -- in the unlikely event it is that.... hopefully going to a pelvic floor specialist might resolve the abdominal/penile issue, This pain in the head of my penis (not STD related) is definitely not helping either as some days it gets to like a 6/10 and it just fluctuates......idk....I'm at a loss.

I'm going to try Flagil now and just hope it helps with the abdominal issue... I wish these were anxiety related but I'm extremely confident they aren't, even though I know anxiety can create and exasperate symptoms. 

Not sure what else I can try/do to get at least the abdominal or the pain at the tip of my penis to stop.",1.0

Did your test not include a reflex free T4? Your TSH being that low suggests hyperthyroidism (which does not match your symptoms as best as I can tell) or some problem with your pituitary (much less common). Personally, I would not wait 2 weeks and get this retested with a free T4 (if any Endocrinologists want to weigh in on whether T3 or anything else would be useful that would be helpful). 

Your ferritin is normal. I'm not going to attempt to interpret your LH. You vitamin D is normal to low depending on what range you use. If you're not supplementing with vitamin D, no harm in starting 2000U daily. This is not related to any of your symptoms.",8.0

AskDocs,NASH,1gqluot,So many obscure symptoms pointing to autoimmune disease yet my rehemotologist is convinced there is nothing wrong likely because I am fat. Please help. I’m getting sicker and sicker and the conditions are just piling up ,"40(F) hx of PTSD, ADHD, life long obesity, level 2 autism (diagnosed at age 39), Dyxpraxia generalized chronic pain, IBS, fibromyalgia, NASH, Lumbar Degenerative Disc Disease, sacrolititis, and lumbar spondylitis with radiopathy (sp) and significant dandruff that is not responding to standard treatment. Long term treatment with various antidepressants, stimulants, and some NSAID use to deal with pain. Past hx of binge drinking but is under control since 2015. Currently working with rehumotologist, gastroenterologist, spine specialist, and dermatologist. Will be starting pain management next week. 

Ok. I was relatively physically healthy besides being fat until March of 2023. At the end of that month I went to the ER with what I thought was a migrane and ended up having an emergency gall bladder removal and liver biopsy that resulted in significant complications including internal bleeding, shock, a 12cm abdominal hematoma, and the start of pneumonia. In the months that followed I developed significant diarrhea and diverticular disease leading to 2 flares of diverticulitis in less than 6 months, one requiring IV antibiotics. To complicate this I started to develop issues with low back pain and nerve issues impacting my hips, knees, and ankles that have not improved much with physical therapy. Xray shows mild DDD at L5-S1 and my insurance is refusing to cover additional lumbar spine imaging. I also frequently experience periods of severe shooting shoulder pain (treated with steroid shots that has calmed it down) and pain and warmth in my elbows, wrists, knuckles, heels, and Achilles tendons. My current pain diagnosis are listed above. 

I have had extensive blood work completed all of which has been negative except a slightly high anti-RNP that was retested and normal and a slightly high ESR at 28, last tested in early 2023. I am HLA-B27 negative. My WBC count is also usually high and will ask for CRP and ESR to be retested at my upcoming pain management appointment. 

All of the personal research I done on these symptoms points back to inflammatory arthritis or some sort of inflammatory process, yet my rehumotologist is convinced that everything is due to fibromyalgia. I also feel that being obese (current bmi around 43 and lifetime bmi generally hovering around 38-40) is causing people to over look my concerns. 

Am I completely off base here and everything can be contributed to me being fat? My family has been fat my entire life and have never experienced any of these concerns particularly the level of pain that I experience and the gastrointestinal issues. The exception to this is my uncle who has chrons but I have been screened for chrons and UC and while I had large colon polyps I do not have either inflammatory bowel disease. 

One other bit of information. I traveled in developing countries throughout my 20s and spent 3 years living in China and eating a Chinese diet. 

Can someone please give me some guidance here. I feel like I am running in circles here and am getting sicker in the process. Also my body does not shed weight due to PCOS and I have been trying to lose weight ever since I was a 10 year old kid and suddenly gained 40 pounds. The only time I have ever lost any significant amount of weight I was taking stimulants, barely eating, working in a physical job and then working out 2 hours plus a day. I definitely could improve my diet and current activity levels, but I’ve always been a relatively active person who eats too much, but does eat pretty healthy.

1. Is it possible for there to be drug-induced liver fibrosis with normal AST and ALT? 
2. If so, which drug/s might be likely cause of liver damage/iron deposits given timeline below? [I've been taking sulindac for 3yrs with zero prior issues; nirogacestat is known to be hepatotoxic but I started taking reduced dose 3 days before first CT scan with relevant liver findings and 10 days before first MRI with relevant liver findings; I don't know if doxil is hepatotoxic?]
3. Even though I'm 5wks out from my last doxil infusion, it feels like I'm struggling to run 2mins/mi slower than I'm usually comfortable running by 3wks post-infusion. Could liver iron deposits/fibrosis be causing that?

**10/7/24 MRI report excerpt**
LIVER: At the periphery of the right hepatic lobe, there are geographic areas of T1 hypointensity corresponding to hypoattenuation seen on CT abdomen pelvis, without corresponding T2 or diffusion abnormalities, and have traversing vasculature. There is also more discrete 2 cm focus in segment 6/7 with similar signal characteristics. These correspond to areas of abnormally increased iron deposition. No discrete lesions or masses. Conventional hepatic arterial anatomy is present. Hepatic, portal, and superior mesenteric veins are patent.
 
Quantitative metrics: R2* of the liver is 84 Hz, which equates to a T2* of 12 ms. This is indicative of no iron overload of the background liver. Hepatic fat fraction is 1.3%. Normal hepatic fat fraction is less than 5%.

IMPRESSION:
 1.  Queried hepatic abnormality corresponds to focal and segmental peripheral fibrosis and iron deposition, consistent with chronic ischemic injury, possibly drug-induced. Consider biopsy of the most confluent component in segment 6/7 if clinically indicated.

**CT scan Incidental liver findings (below).** Even though it's not a highly increased risk, there are case reports of ppl with FAP and hepatocellular carcinoma with non-cirrhotic, healthy livers. [and I know of more from patient groups.] It seems we might often get diagnosed incidentally and earlier than most (of the few) with HCC and non-cirrhotic livers because many of us get regular imaging for abdominal issues (desmoid tumors, adhesions, SBO).

Abdominal MRI with contrast next week. NPO for 4hrs prior and they'll be giving me glucagon. 

1. Should I try to push my oncologist to change MRI order to include liver protocols that might allow for detection (or exclusion) of HCC (hepatobiliary contrast agents, etc)?
2. Post-colectomy, my small intestine is usually so constantly active (even after fasting) that it's made it very difficult for radiologists to visualize things in my imaging (even during a prior MRE with glucagon). Should I ask my drs about anything else to do to increase chances of this imaging being clear enough?
3. Does this seem likely to be anything other than HCC or metastases from some unknown primary?
4. Given these incidental liver findings, do I need to ask my GI about getting the proceduralist to use the sideview upper scope prior to 1yr to see if there might be more abnormality around ampulla?
5. Should I start looking for a hepatologist?

FINDINGS: [will post pics in comments]
Liver and biliary tree: Nonspecific ill-defined hypoattenuating observation in segment 6/7 measuring approximately 2.5 x 2.2 cm. This observation is subtly present on 4/2024 exam and is not well seen on delayed imaging of current exam. New nonspecific geographic hypoenhancement of the periphery of the right hepatic dome which may reflect transient hepatic attenuation differences. Scattered hypoattenuating foci too small to characterize but favored to represent cysts. No intrahepatic biliary dilatation. Gallbladder is within normal limits.

Kidneys and ureters: No obstructing calculi. No hydroureteronephrosis. Cystic observation measuring up to 9 mm in the left upper pole which measures higher than simple fluid attenuation. Otherwise symmetric enhancement and excretion.

Peritoneal cavity: Trace pelvic free fluid. 
[4/2024 CT scan: Peritoneum/Retroperitoneum: Trace free fluid in the right paracolic gutter.] 

Lymph nodes: No enlarged lymph nodes. Several higher density than normal nodules or lymph nodes in the mesentery. Ill-defined tissue or nodularity along the right retroperitoneum.
 [4/2024 CT scan: Lymph nodes: Associated enlarged right lower quadrant lymph nodes superior to the mesenteric mass measuring up to 1 cm. Enlarged mid mesenteric lymph node measuring 0.8 cm.]

IMPRESSION: 
2.  Multiple incidental observations which are incompletely evaluated on single phase exam. Recommend correlation with prior imaging, if available, or further evaluation with MRI on an outpatient basis: 

* Nonspecific ill-defined hypoattenuating observation in segment 6 and 7 which is similar to 4/2024 exam and is not well seen on delayed imaging, potentially a mass lesion versus a perfusional abnormality.

For several things, one or my drs has ignored it or advised me to wait weeks or months or even years for me to only find out on follow up that:
- no, those EGD findings actually indicated I may have FAP, needed a colonoscopy, and may require a colectomy 
- no, the mass at 12:00, 3in below collar bone, and 6in from nipple that formed <10 days post-biopsy  proven desmoid at 10:00, 2-3in from nipplethat was not palpable, not visualized with the eye or US or mammogram that was <1cm was not an inflamed lymph node.

I wonder if she had biopsy proven disease (from a surgical biopsy) or clinical diagnosis from symptoms, labs and imaging? Often if the type of lung disease isn't clear it can lead to concern about adding other therapies. There are several other of a group called interstitial lung diseases as well as infections and autoimmune disease that can appear quite similar.

Steroids are the lynchpin of treatment for COP. Most patients respond very well to these. If there is rapidly progressive respiratory failure then large doses of intravenous steroids are given. There are as you say other agents that can be added in someone who has disease progression despite high dose steroids - cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, cyclosporine, mycophenolate and rituxan have all been used. 

There is not any good quality data to support whether these other agents are effective and which is preferable. Unfortunately most patients who are this sick from noninfectious interstitial pneumonitis and do not respond to high dose steroids do not do well despite the addition of other medicines.

AskDocs,NASH,18xpvh5,Difficulty understanding some information and how it should be approached,"My mom, 59F, has a plethora of serious conditions, most notably NASH and CHF NYHA class 2. Most of her hospitalizations over the past year have been due to hepatic encephalopathy as we were trying to find the sweet spot with lactulose and dealing with some non compliance on her part. We finally have the lactulose to a point that it would be odd for her to have an episode. She has really horrific lymphedema in both legs.

She takes diuretics (Bumex 1mg 2xdaily, and spironolactone 25mg 1x daily.) She was released from hospital on 12/19 with a dry weight if 261. (She was admited for hypoxia, related to fluid retention) We went for low sodium diet (under 2g a day) but for some reason she still retained fluid and we moved to 3 Bumex a day under doctor's order. Then her urine output significantly slowed down, whichled to her hospitalization. Her kidneys have always been okay Non AA eGFR was always at or above 100. When she was readmitted on 12/29, her eGFR was 46, and today, after remaining in hospital is down to 31. Her creatinine has steadily went up (1.8), as her BUN, up to 38. They have tried IV Bumex but are walking the fine line of removing fluid without causing any possible (further) kidney damage. The problem now is that tbey cannot find the fluid. She went from 260lbs to 284lbs. She has mild pleural effusions and mild pulmonary edema. She just had this CT scan, and I don't know what it means. 

Moderate bilateral pleural effusions with left lower lobe consolidation consistent with pneumonia versus atelectasis (This I understand) 
 
Cardiomegaly without overt CHF (This I understand) 
 
Nodular hepatic changes suggesting cirrhosis. Within the significant limitation of no oral or IV contrast, no demonstrated intra-abdominal or pelvic mass or inflammatory collection (This I mostly understand.)
 
Diffusely increased attenuation within the subcutaneous fat, compatible with low oncotic state. (This I have no clue. Attenuation as best I know means weakened or diminished, but in this case I am lost.)

I don't know what this means. What will happen if her kidney function continues to decrease? Is there any other way to remove the fluid? I'm so sorry for the long post, but I have no clue what is happening and I'm really scared. I've been taking care of her for several years, and I try to stay as educated as I can on her different diseases, this is just totally new for me.",3.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/18xpvh5/difficulty_understanding_some_information_and_how/,No_Goose4898,2024-01-03 10:17:37,2.0,post,,,

AskDocs,NASH,1729f2o,"Stage 1 liver fibrosis at 20 years old, am I doing enough to treat it? And is it reversible?","20FTM (AFAB), 179 lb, 5'5. Previous weight was my highest at 192 lb at roughly 4-5 months ago. 

No history of smoking, previous period of drinking 1 drink roughly 1x/week over a 2 month period June-July 2023, which is over. 

diagnoses: T2D (no retinopathy, no neuropathy, since 2014 age 10, a1c under 6% for at least the past 3 years), NASH (previously NAFLD, first noted 2017 age 14, saw GI inconsistently), Iron deficieny anemia, MDD, ASD, ADHD-C. 

Medication: Metformin ER, Ozempic, Lexapro, Focalin XR, Trazodone, Testosterone Cypionate, Yuvafem, Ferrous Sulfate, Vitamin E.

Main complaint: Liver fibrosis, unsure of how long I have had it

Over the past year or so my endo has noticed that my ALT / AST levels have been slowly rising so I was told to see my GI again. I have a recurrent history of them being normal to mildy/moderately elevated, which started around 2017.

I have not had consistent monitoring with my liver. When I aged out of the pediatric GI I went without one until Sep 2022 who I was seeing for bowel issues related to metformin. after that was resolved I did not see him until August 2023, however my endo also monitors my lipids, my metabolic panel, and CBC alongside my A1C, which is how this was noticed.

They started going up around Novemember of 2022. I've had a lot happen since then, so I'll try to list everything I can remember, including instances of sickness and significant medication changes:

- I started masculizing HRT, October 2022
- I stopped Metformin ER 2000mg for Ozempic October 2022
- I tested positive for Hep A antibodies in January 2023 (routine bloodwork). Unsure of when I contracted hep A
- I started Focalin XR for my ADHD, Feburary 2023
- By around March 2023 I gained 10 pounds and was my highest at 192 lb. I think this is from a combination of starting testosterone and Ozempic by itself doing nothing for me
- I went back on the metformin ER , 1000mg / day while still being on Ozempic 1mg weekly
- Since Feb 2023 I have been changing my diet, previously I would eat nothing but high-fat high-carb (150+/day)  with very little fruit and no vegetables(ever)  and fast food 3x-4x a week. As of now I eat closer to 100 carbs / day, a lot more protien, eat fast food 2-3 times a month max, and have vegetables with nearly every meal. It wasn't a sudden shift though, I have had to work my way up to this
- I had a bout of recurrent UTIs (roughly 10) which included a few courses of antibiotics and a *lot* of AZO (Phenazopyridine Hydrochloride 99.5mg), Roughly 2 times a day for at least a week out of a month around from April to August 2023. 
- I've started exercising, brisk walk roughly 45min-1hr/day I plan to add more variety but I'm still new to this. Haven't consistently exercised in roughly 8 years before this due to mental illness.



Got some tests done, ultrasound, more blood tests, here are the results: 

Ultrasound: Gallbladder polyp + diffuse fat throughout the liver

Fibrosis score - 0.26 H , fibrosis stage F0-F1
Necroinflammatory score - 0.30, Activity grade A1 minimal activity
Alpha 2 macroglobulins, Qn - 351
Haptoglobulin - 94
Apolipoprotien - 105
Bilirubin - 0.3
GGT - 26
ALT - 53


Previous results, all blood tests below done with 12hr fasting

- 4/1/22 ALT 43 / AST 38 /Triglycerides 186

- 8/1/22 ALT 26 / AST 23 / Triglyicerides 208

- 9/23/22 ALT 53 / AST 74 (This is when I was in the ER , spleenomegaly, appendix inflammation, was going to grt an appendictomy but they said I was fine)

- 12/1/22 ALT 29 / AST 32  Triglycerides 149

- 1/24/23 ALT 35 / AST 28

- 3/3/23 ALT 37 / AST 26 Triglycerides 237

- 7/12/23 ALT 73 / AST 41 Triglycerides 191 (This was during when I was drinking)

So like, I lost 13 pounds, I eat so much healthier than I used to, I exercise now, am I doing enough? Is liver fibrosis reversible? If it is, and I am successful at repairing my liver, am I still at a higher risk of getting it again? Is there a set 'amount' of weight I need to lose before I see an improvement? Will what I'm doing even help, or is cirrhrosis inevitable?

When I say this I'm not trying to imply that I'm shifting my lifestyle just for better test results, or I'll go back to my old habits once I'm in a healthy range. But I'd like to know what to expect going forward, and if the pace at which I'm trying to heal my body from eating nothing but bread, cheese, and fried food for the first 20 years of my life is fast enough. I'm taking this very seriously - however I do have a extensive history of disordered eating (restriction, purging, binging, cutting back on insulin when I was on it) so if I go into this too fast I worry that I'll relapse. 

Any advice is appreciated, I thought I was doing well but I feel so lost right now.

I quit the juul thanks to Nicorette lozenges, I don’t have a plan to quit Nicotine itself — I’ve found it to greatly enhance my stress tolerance and concentration which is important in my line of work. My doctor has told me that outside of dependence (ship sailed a while ago), there really aren’t that many long-term risks especially if it stops me from using the juul. 

Although they work and keep me off the Juul, they taste disgusting and can sometime exacerbate my GERD (though this has become much less of a problem as time has gone on). 

I’m interested in Zyn, but as a non-approved NRT I am wary. In theory it would seem to be fine, Buccally absorbed nicotine just in a different package. Haven’t found any studies citing harmful additives either. But I just don’t know.

I am completely lost so I’m gonna give as detailed history as I can and hopefully someone somewhere has seen something similar before. 

I am 28 (will be 29 on the 21st) 5”4 281 lbs. I have heds, EOE, IIH, NASH, asthma, depression, anxiety, ptsd, a torn labrum in my right hip, a nodule in my right lung, fat cells on my heart and a history of 2 pericardial effusion both resolved on their own. I have two stents in my brain and an lp shunt. I also wear dentures if that helps! 

Since Friday I have felt off. Yesterday (Monday) I woke up, fuzzy, dizzy, nauseous, pain in my shunt and down the catheter. I felt like I was here but I wasn’t. Everything came back normal (I will include all lab and image results) i was given Zofran and .5 of Dilotid and a liter of fluid. 

I was told I had a migraine and sent home.

4-5 hours later I felt like I couldn’t breathe and I pulled out my pulse ox and I was down to 82. I took my inhaler two puffs and it only got me to 87. I called 911 and was taken to the hospital. I was on 3 liters with a nose cannula. My oxygen started dropped and then at 93 the ambulance worker gave me a full mask and it went back up. At the hospital they gave me oxygen, a steroid, more Dilaudid, and a liter of fluid. Then I got a neb treatment. After the treatment was done I was taken off to see if it would help. My heart rate was 123 bpm. I do have a fast rate at 95-105 on a beta blocker. While off the oxygen my oxygen dropped to 87 and I called the nurse. She tried saying it was my nails but it was reading normally and so then she moved it to my toe and it was 75-83 and she put me back on oxygen. They did a chest X-ray that showed nothing. While on oxygen they said everything was fine and took it off seconds before I was discharged. This morning my resting heart rate is 120-128 and I’m at 88-95 for oxygen. 

I wrote to my primary and they can’t see me until Friday, my pulmonologist hasn’t written back to me yet. Has anyone seen this? Can anyone help??",25.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/16asdpo/help/,Automatic-Bad-9444,2023-09-05 09:10:59,24.0,post,,,

Also your dropped oxygen saturation levels mean insufficient oxygen exchange happening at the alveolar level in your lungs or a cardiac issue affecting oxygen distribution. The rapid heart rate could be a compensatory mechanism to maintain tissue perfusion. 

This is not something to take lightly or delay. Go to the ER. You might be put back on oxygen, maybe even a higher flow this time. They'll likely do a CT or MRI to check on that shunt. If it's malfunctioning like I suspect surgical intervention might be needed. They'll also probably redo some of those chest X-rays or even do a CT for a better look at your lung nodule and to rule out any other lung issues.",37.0

AskDocs,NASH,14nsh2j,Possibly cancerous spot?,"I am a 41F, almost a year ago a black spot started to appear on my right wrist. It grew slightly, not much. It was mostly black in color, some purple, and red around the outside. The first time I brought it up to my doctor she said that it was probably just scar tissue. I didn't know that scar tissue could pop up out of nowhere without there being any sort of injury or anything, but I'm not a doctor so I trusted her. I went back again late last week (Friday) and it had gotten larger, but not in length or width, it was growing taller out of my skin so it was getting quite annoying so I asked her to look at it and she decided quite quickly that it needed to be removed and scheduled the appointment for the very next business day. So I went in on Monday and the removal was easy peasy, but unfortunately there are still black pieces inside my wound. And for the first time in the history of my being with my doctor, and with the new online system, she is holding my test results so that I don't see them before her, which obviously scares me. Black/purple spot that isn't fully removed and I'm not allowed to see the results? Definitely nervous. I do have some other health issues, I am diabetic, I have neuropathy in both feet, I have NASH and level 2 of liver disease, which is fibrosis i believe. I also am alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency carrier, phenotype MZ (I really don't know what that means other than I'm more susceptible to liver and lung problems), also red blood cell antibody positive, I have had to have a parotidectomy (left side) and multiple lymph node removals due to abnormal masses. I am going to have to get the right side done as well but I've chosed to watch and maintain instead of cut for the moment because that surgery was insanely painful and I've had my fair share of surgeries. I even got those tests results before my doctors so it's really odd that my doctor is withholding the results this time. I am a 24 year long smoker. So, yeah. Should I be worried about this? Two weeks is a long time to ask someone to wait to hear about something like this, don't you think? The wound has been incredibly itchy but I think that's just from it healing but man, it sucks!!! And I'll attach pictures, I don't know if I'm just crazy or if the spots are actually getting a little bit bigger. I know it sounds insane because it's only been a few days but if you look at the pictures it seems like it's growing. And to be brutally honest, I might be completely making nothing into something because I'm scared and so nervous about the results but I think anyone would be if they had a black and purple spot removed and then they were told by their doctor that there were still remnants in there and that she'd let me know what we'd do after the results came in, which could be a couple days or a couple weeks. Big difference there!! Although I believe the longer the wait the worse the news so hopefully I'll hear from her really, really soon. It's Saturday now, so I won't hear anything until at least Monday, which would be a week after removal. Anyway, I think now I've given you my entire life story lol, has anyone seen anything like this or had one like this?

I’ll also preface this by saying I’m not a doctor and dermatology isn’t my specialty.

The reason we give you estimates of days to weeks is because so much of it is out of our hands. The pathologist’s office isn’t part of the primary care office and we have to wait on their analysis. Then, we also have a full patient load and we’re trying to see all of our patients and answer telephone and patient portal questions while making time to review labs, x-rays and various other diagnostic tests like your own. I’m not saying this in any way other than just an explanation of the timeframe.

You may or may not hear from your doctor’s office Monday. I actually have an appointment with my PA on July 4th as their office decided to take Monday off as the holiday time and work the actual holiday itself. I’ve never encountered that before with Independence Day but alright.

Speaking of holidays, they notoriously slow things down. 

No one here is going to be able to definitively tell you if this is cancerous or not, only your doctor can do that. But while you wait, please don’t assume that the timeframe itself is indicative of a skin cancer diagnosis. If anything, sometimes things that are urgent can get flagged and moved up the line for review.

Because you’re so anxious, it’s not inappropriate to send a portal message asking about the results, but don’t let the anxiety take over if you don’t hear anything at the beginning of the week (because of the holiday).

There’s nothing else you can do to “speed up” the process. The best thing you can do right now is distract yourself with work, hobbies, books, friends and other activities that give you joy. 

I hope everything works out great for you.",15.0

AskDocs,NASH,14nsh2j,Possibly cancerous spot?,,,,mustangkitty427,2023-07-01 05:41:54,,comment,jq94v6v,"Thank you. I didn't even remember that there was a holiday this upcoming week lol. Tells you how much I've been paying attention. Along with all this, my three year old daughter got a nasty virus and was really ill for the entire week so no sleep, no naps, nothing but a lot of mommy and daughter time and a whole lot of worrying because of nonstop coughing and high fevers. Lets just say it's been a rough week. But thank you for your response. As patients, we don't always think about everything that goes on behind the scenes at a doctor's office. I know that when I usually try to get an appointment with my practitioner it can be anywhere from weeks to months before they can get me in, so I know she has to have hundreds of patients and I can't imagine trying to keep track of everyone. I guess that's also what freaked me out, because they got me in so soon for the removal. But I know that there's nothing to do but wait, I'm just not very good at it lol.",6.0

Also, I hope your daughter is improving. Sick kiddos definitely add to stress.

Worry is carrying tomorrow’s load today and there’s no need to do it. Send in a quick portal query then put it out of your mind for the next few days and enjoy the holiday (I know it’s easier said than done).

Also, you’re very welcome; I hope my replies have helped some. 

Best of luck.",5.0
AskDocs,NASH,14nsh2j,Possibly cancerous spot?,,,,None,2023-07-01 06:56:10,,comment,jq9d7em,NAD but wanted to reassure you that even if it is cancerous it is not necessarily something that can't be dealt with extremely easily. My husband had melanoma in his scalp at 30. It was in his hair and discovered by accident so they have no idea how long it was there but it was fairly large area. He had outpatient proceedure to remove and no recurrence 23 years later. I have had squamous cell removed by MOHS and doing fine years later. We have both also had numerous things removed by our extremely dermatologists that specialize in skin cancers (meaning they know what it looks like and are not apt to remove things that don't look suspicious to them) that have turned out to be nothing. One on my arm looks super suspect and was a spider bite. So just know that even if it turns out to be something that needs to be removed it can be done easily.,3.0
AskDocs,NASH,14l6qha,Mysterious black area under abnormal mole that was removed,"I am a 41F, almost a year ago a black spot started to appear on my right wrist. It grew slightly, not much. It was mostly black in color, some purple, and red around the outside. The first time I brought it up to my doctor she said that it was probably just scar tissue. I went back again and it had gotten larger, but not in length or width, it was growing taller out of my skin so it was getting quite annoying so I asked if she would remove it, but she was far ahead of me and had already scheduled the removal I guess. So I went in on Monday and the removal was easy peasy, but unfortunately there are still black pieces inside my arm. And for the first time in the history of my being with my doctor, and with the new online system, she is holding my test results so that I don't see them before her, which obviously scares me a little. Black/purple spot that isn't fully removed and I'm not allowed to see the results? Definitely nervous. I do have some other health issues, I am diabetic, I have neuropathy in both feet, I have NASH and level 2 of liver disease, which is fibrosis i believe. I also am alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency carrier, phenotype MZ (I really don't know what that means other than I'm more susceptible to liver and lung problems), also red blood cell antibody positive, I have had to have a parotidectomy (left side) and multiple lymph node removals due to abnormal masses. I am going to have to get the right side done as well but I've chosed to watch and maintain instead of cut for the moment because that surgery was insanely painful and I've had my fair share of surgeries. I am a 24 year long smoker. So, yeah. Should I be worried about this? Two weeks is a long time to ask someone to wait to hear about something like this, don't you think?",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/14l6qha/mysterious_black_area_under_abnormal_mole_that/,mustangkitty427,2023-06-28 04:16:19,8.0,post,,,

Doctor mentioned that there was still remnants in there and they might have to do a more thorough surgery to remove it. She said that it depended on what the pathology said on what we would do next but, like I said in my post, never in the history of my being with this doctor and all of the dozens and dozens of tests I've had, she's never held my test results from me before.

AskDocs,NASH,11jmo8s,"Unexplained, intermittent fever","40/F, 5’,6”, 220 pounds, former smoker quit 5+ years ago. I am on PCOS, NASH, bipolar, FAP. Lithium, Prozac, Nexplanon, fish, oil, labetaol

Symptoms started February 6. For about 10 days, symptoms were constant. After that, seven times, and go. Tylenol and Advil are effective.

Symptoms include headache, bodyaches, exhaustion, poor attention, span. When I have those symptoms, my temperature in my ear reads 101+. When I do not have symptoms, my temperature is In the normal range.

My temperature reads normal on my forehead, under my tongue, or under my armpit. I have used multiple thermometers for comparison. I have also tested other peoples temperatures with the same thermometers. Their ear temperature is in the normal range. 

My PCP ran bloodwork. WBC was above average in urinalysis. Everything else was in normal ranges. 

PCP said that they would not run any further labs. I will need to go to ED for follow-up, labs, cultures, or CT. as this is not life-threatening, and not keeping me out of work, I disagree with the plan of going to the ED. I feel this is something my doctors office should handle. Looking for advice. Is it possible my ear temperature is just higher and I don't have a fever?",2.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/AskDocs/comments/11jmo8s/unexplained_intermittent_fever/,Cowhaus,2023-03-05 19:11:41,1.0,post,,,
