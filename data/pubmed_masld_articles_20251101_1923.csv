40991062,GLP-1 receptor agonism: a transformative approach for managing type-2 diabetes and obesity.,"GLP-1 receptor agonists represent a breakthrough for managing type-2 diabetes and obesity, offering metabolic benefits across multiple organ systems. These medications provide effective glycaemic control, significant weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection through complex signalling pathways affecting pancreatic, gastrointestinal, neural, and cardiovascular tissues. Their therapeutic potential extends beyond metabolic disorders. Clinical studies demonstrate substantial decreases in HbA1c, body weight (15-20%), and cardiovascular events compared to traditional treatments. Emerging applications include non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and neurodegenerative conditions. Significant barriers still exist despite established safety profiles, such as high costs that restrict access worldwide, a lack of predictive biomarkers for treatment response, a lack of knowledge about the mechanistics of gut microbiota interactions, and an incomplete understanding of long-term safety, particularly with regard to thyroid and pancreatic effects. Research gaps include appropriate patient classification, cost-effectiveness across healthcare systems, and established methodologies for developing applications. Potential future developments include novel delivery mechanisms, multi-receptor agonists, and a broader range of therapeutic uses for the treatment of metabolic disorders and their consequences. From their identification as incretin hormones to development of long-acting analogue, GLP-1 agonists have revolutionized metabolic disease management. Their pleiotropic benefits arise from intricate signalling cascades that regulate appetite, insulin secretion, and energy homeostasis across multiple tissues.",2025,Sep,Saudi pharmaceutical journal : SPJ : the official publication of the Saudi Pharmaceutical Society,Abdulrahman G Alharbi,1718,True,2025-09-01
40093363,Multimodal AI predicts clinical outcomes of drug combinations from preclinical data.,"Predicting clinical outcomes from preclinical data is essential for identifying safe and effective drug combinations, reducing late-stage clinical failures, and accelerating the development of precision therapies. Current AI models rely on structural or target-based features but fail to incorporate the multimodal data necessary for accurate, clinically relevant predictions. Here, we introduce Madrigal, a multimodal AI model that learns from structural, pathway, cell viability, and transcriptomic data to predict drug-combination effects across 953 clinical outcomes and 21,842 compounds, including combinations of approved drugs and novel compounds in development. Madrigal uses an attention bottleneck module to unify preclinical drug data modalities while handling missing data during training and inference, a major challenge in multimodal learning. It outperforms single-modality methods and state-of-the-art models in predicting adverse drug interactions, and ablations show both modality alignment and multimodality are necessary. It captures transporter-mediated interactions and aligns with head-to-head clinical trial differences for neutropenia, anemia, alopecia, and hypoglycemia. In type 2 diabetes and MASH, Madrigal supports polypharmacy decisions and prioritizes resmetirom among safer candidates. Extending to personalization, Madrigal improves patient-level adverse-event prediction in a longitudinal EHR cohort and an independent oncology cohort, and predicts ex vivo efficacy in primary acute myeloid leukemia samples and patient-derived xenograft models. Madrigal links preclinical multimodal readouts to safety risks of drug combinations and offers a generalizable foundation for safer combination design.",2025,Sep,ArXiv,Yepeng Huang; Xiaorui Su; Varun Ullanat; Intae Moon; Ivy Liang; Lindsay Clegg; Damilola Olabode; Ruthie Johnson; Nicholas Ho; Megan Gibbs; Megan Gibbs; Alexander Gusev; Bino John; Marinka Zitnik,1732,True,2025-09-01
41056908,Fungal endophytes.,"Organisms are commonly grouped into ecological guilds that reflect their shared resource use and similar ecological roles. The guild concept has been used to categorize the vast diversity of the fungal kingdom (estimated at 2.2-5 million species) into groups of fungi with common lifestyles, such as mycorrhizal symbionts, pathogens of animals and plants, and the group that is the focus of this primer - fungal endophytes of plants. Fungal endophytes have resisted scientists' attempts to silo organisms into neat assemblages. Scattered across the fungal tree of life and lacking few diagnostic characteristics, they are defined less by what they are than by what they are not.",2025,Oct,Current biology : CB,Julian Cosner; Gaurav Pandharikar; Keaton Tremble; Jake Nash; Tomás A Rush; Rytas Vilgalys; Claire Veneault-Fourrey,679,True,2025-10-01
41116207,Roles of the Keap1/Nrf2 pathway and mitophagy in liver diseases.,"Nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) is an intracellular transcription factor that helps protect against oxidative stress in different types of cells under pathological conditions. Mitochondria are vital organelles that function in diverse metabolic processes in the body, including redox reactions, lipid metabolism, and cell death. Mitophagy, a specific form of autophagy for damaged mitochondria, plays a critical role in the pathophysiology of liver diseases. In this review, we explain in detail the roles of the Nrf2 signaling pathway and mitophagy, and the relationship between them, in various hepatic diseases (nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, viral hepatitis, alcoholic liver disease, drug-induced liver injury, autoimmune hepatitis, hepatic ischemia‒reperfusion injury, and liver cancer). We also offer some potential insights and treatments relevant to clinical applications. 核因子E2相关因子2（Nrf2）是一种细胞内转录因子，在病理条件下有助于保护不同类型细胞免受氧化应激。线粒体参与机体内多种代谢过程，包括氧化还原反应、脂质代谢和细胞死亡等。线粒体自噬是自噬的一种特殊形式，专门负责清除受损的线粒体，在肝脏疾病病理生理机制中起着重要作用。本综述详细阐述了Nrf2信号通路和线粒体自噬在各种肝脏疾病（非酒精性脂肪性肝病、病毒性肝炎、酒精性肝病、药物性肝损伤、自身免疫性肝炎、肝缺血再灌注损伤和肝癌）中的作用及其相互关系，同时提供了一些临床应用相关的潜在见解和治疗方法。.",2025,Aug,Journal of Zhejiang University.

41135761,Alpha-1 antitrypsin Pi*MZ variant increases the risk of liver disease progression in MASLD and MASH.,"Most investigational treatments for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) show modest anti-fibrotic effects, likely due to a multifactorial aetiology. The Pi*Z mutation in SERPINA1 can lead to proteotoxic liver injury and progressive chronic liver disease. Here, we investigate whether the SERPINA1 Z mutation is associated with disease progression in MASLD/MASH. A population of MASLD/MASH patients of European ancestry was identified in the UK Biobank using ICD-10 codes (N=6319). We estimated odds ratios (OR) for advanced liver disease (composite of incident cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation, and liver-related death/transplant) with the MZ genotype. ORs were compared with metabolic risk factors (RFs; obesity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes) and established genetic RFs (PNPLA3, HSD17B13, and TM6SF2). Some individuals (7.9%) experienced advanced liver disease. The MZ genotype prevalence was greater in individuals who experienced advanced liver disease (7.6% vs 3.9%). After adjustment for established metabolic and genetic RFs, advanced liver disease was significantly associated with the MZ genotype (OR 2.01; 95% CI, 1.38-2.92). We replicated known associations in all genetic and metabolic RFs. The MZ genotype (OR 1.90; 1.33-2.73) was a risk equivalent to ≥2 metabolic RFs (OR 1.74; 1.44-2.09) and PNPLA3 (OR 1.32; 1.15-1.51). Carriage of the Pi*Z mutation significantly affects the risk of future clinical outcomes among individuals with MASLD/MASH. The MZ genotype confers a risk equivalent to established RFs in MASLD/MASH, underscoring the importance of screening and further work to understand the underlying mechanisms.",2025,Oct,Annals of hepatology,Bradley Jermy; Jack Brownrigg; Pavel Strnad; Rohit Loomba,1745,True,2025-10-01
41026248,Headline: Fracture Risk in Type 2 Diabetes: Systematic Review of Cardiovascular Outcome Trials with Glucagon Like Peptide Receptor Agonists.,"This systematic review examined the available evidence on fracture risk in people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) using cardiovascular outcome trials with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA). A systematic Literature search identified 797 records, of which 643 remained after duplicate removal. Following screening, 20 studies met the criteria for inclusion. Although GLP-1 RAs have demonstrated well-established benefits in glycaemic control, weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection, their impact on bone health remains incompletely understood. Preclinical studies suggest potential bone-protective effects, including increased bone mass, improved microarchitecture, and reduced bone resorption. However, evidence from human studies has been inconsistent. While some findings indicate a possible reduction in fracture risk with long-term GLP-1 RA therapy, further research is needed to clarify their role in bone metabolism and fracture prevention among people with T2D, particularly within the context of cardiovascular outcome trials.",2025,Sep,Current osteoporosis reports,Aksayan Arunanthy Mahalingasivam; Nicklas Højgaard-Hessellund Rasmussen,1055,True,2025-09-01
40995421,Pharmacotherapy for Obesity: Recent Updates.,"In this narrative review we describe the recent updates regarding anti-obesity medications as of February 2025. We describe the physiologic mechanisms underpinning the development of hunger, satiation, and maintenance of satiety to address targets for anti-obesity medications. The efficacy, mechanism, and additional beneficial effects of anti-obesity medications are then further detailed. For this review, we focus on FDA-approved medications for obesity and on select medications currently under development and undergoing Phase 2 and 3 trials. We start by focusing on the non-incretin anti-obesity medications orlistat, phentermine, phentermine-topiramate, and naltrexone-bupropion. We also highlight setmelanotide for heritable obesity. The mechanism of action and comparative efficacy of the GLP-1 receptor agonists liraglutide and semaglutide are reviewed. Tirzepatide, the GLP-1 and GIP-receptor dual agonist is described, and weight loss is compared to alternative anti-obesity medications. Additional incretin targets in the pipeline include dual co-agonists to glucagon and GLP-1 receptors, triple agonists targeting glucagon, GLP-1 and GIP, novel GLP-1 agonists, oral formulations of GLP-1 agonists, and amylin agonists. Finally, we provide best practices for adjuncts to pharmacologic treatments of obesity, monitoring efficacy of obesity treatments, and adjusting medication regimens for providers.",2025,01,Clinical pharmacology : advances and applications,Thomas Ward Fredrick; Michael Camilleri; Andres Acosta,1414,True,2025-01-01

39420154,Actions of thyroid hormones and thyromimetics on the liver.,"Thyroid hormones (triiodothyronine and thyroxine) are pivotal for metabolic balance in the liver and entire body. Dysregulation of the hypothalamus-pituitary-thyroid axis can contribute to hepatic metabolic disturbances, affecting lipid metabolism, glucose regulation and protein synthesis. In addition, reductions in circulating and intrahepatic thyroid hormone concentrations increase the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease by inducing lipotoxicity, inflammation and fibrosis. Amelioration of hepatic metabolic disease by thyroid hormones in preclinical and clinical studies has spurred the development of thyromimetics that target THRB (the predominant thyroid hormone receptor isoform in the liver) and/or the liver itself to provide more selective activation of hepatic thyroid hormone-regulated metabolic pathways while reducing thyrotoxic side effects in tissues that predominantly express THRA such as the heart and bone. Resmetirom, a liver and THRB-selective thyromimetic, recently became the first FDA-approved drug for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Thus, a better understanding of the metabolic actions of thyroid hormones and thyromimetics in the liver is timely and clinically relevant. Here, we describe the roles of thyroid hormones in normal liver function and pathogenesis of MASH, as well as some potential clinical issues that might arise when treating patients with MASH with thyroid hormone supplementation or thyromimetics.",2025,Jan,Nature reviews.

41008585,Beyond the BMI Paradox: Unraveling the Cellular and Molecular Determinants of Metabolic Health in Obesity.,"Obesity has traditionally been considered a major risk factor for numerous metabolic disorders and diseases. However, a subset of individuals with obesity, classified as having ""metabolically healthy obesity"" (MHO), display relatively normal metabolic parameters despite excess adiposity. This review critically examines the current knowledge surrounding MHO, including its various definitions, prevalence, clinical characteristics, contributing factors, and long-term outcomes. While MHO carries lower health risks compared to metabolically unhealthy obesity (MUO), evidence consistently demonstrates increased disease risk compared to metabolically healthy normal-weight individuals, particularly for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and certain cancers. MHO prevalence ranges from 10 to 30% among individuals with obesity globally, varying by sex, age, BMI, and ethnicity. Multiple factors contribute to the MHO phenotype, including beneficial adipose tissue distribution patterns, enhanced adipocyte function, favorable genetic profiles, and lifestyle factors. Recent single-cell transcriptomic analyses have identified specific cell populations, particularly mesothelial cells, as key drivers of metabolic health in visceral adipose tissue. The discovery of persistent epigenetic memory of obesity provides molecular evidence for why MHO often represents a transient state, with many individuals progressing to MUO over time. Emerging evidence also reveals differential therapeutic responses to GLP-1 receptor agonists between MHO and MUO phenotypes, highlighting the need for precision medicine approaches. The concept of MHO has important clinical implications for risk stratification and personalized treatment approaches. This review synthesizes current evidence while highlighting knowledge gaps and future research directions in this rapidly evolving field.",2025,Sep,Biomolecules,Kyoichiro Tsuchiya; Takahiro Tsutsumi,1901,True,2025-09-01
41157241,Survival Outcomes in Hepatocellular Carcinoma: Experience from a Multidisciplinary Committee in Ecuador.,"Hepatic cancer is a world health concern due to its high lethality. The main risk factor worldwide is having hepatic cirrhosis. The etiology of hepatic cirrhosis has changed in recent years, with metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) becoming the leading cause, displacing hepatitis C and B viruses and alcoholic liver disease. It is of the utmost importance to develop screening programs in at-risk populations for early detection. The survival rate of HCC, as determined by a group of specialists or an interdisciplinary committee, is a challenge we have taken on in a public health hospital in Ecuador. This retrospective study identified 71 patients diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma, mostly middle-aged men with a history of liver cirrhosis. No significant association was found between the presence of cirrhosis, laboratory abnormalities, and survival. However, the identification by imaging vascular invasion and extrahepatic extension were associated. This study highlights that patients with liver lesions identified through HCC screening have a higher survival rate over a one-year follow-up period.",2025,Oct,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",Enrique Carrera; Jaysoom Abarca; Johana Acuña; Mercedes Almagro; David Armas; Cinthya Borja; Wendy Calderón; Diana Chamorro; Daniel Garzon; Melina Gonzalez; Andrea Moreno; Mónica Proaño; Darwin Quevedo; Maritza Quishpe; Juan Fernando Salazar; Fabian Tulcanazo; Cecilia Trujillo; Gabriela Velalcazar,1131,True,2025-10-01
39720849,The Role of Exercise in Steatotic Liver Diseases: An Updated Perspective.,"The increasing prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), parallels the rise in sedentary lifestyles. MASLD is the most common form of steatotic liver disease (SLD), which represents the umbrella beneath which the vast majority of chronic liver diseases fall, including alcohol-related liver disease and their overlap. These conditions are the leading contributors to chronic liver disease, significantly impacting global morbidity and mortality. Despite the emergence of new pharmacotherapies, exercise represents the foundation of MASLD treatment. This review aims to provide an updated perspective on the role of exercise in the management of SLD, highlight its molecular and clinical benefits, and explore its benefits and safety in the stage of cirrhosis. Evidence from pre-clinical and clinical studies was reviewed to evaluate the impact of exercise on SLD (mainly MASLD), advanced chronic liver disease stages, and its relevance in the context of evolving therapies such as Resmetirom and incretin-based anti-obesity medications. Exercise remains a cornerstone intervention in the management of MASLD, with suggested benefits even for patients who have progressed to cirrhosis. Personalized exercise regimens should be prioritized for all patients, including those receiving pharmacotherapy. Further research is needed to refine exercise protocols and investigate their impact on histologic and clinical outcomes, as well as their potential synergistic effects with emerging treatments.",2025,Jan,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,Iyiad Alabdul Razzak; Ahmed Fares; Jonathan G Stine; Hirsh D Trivedi,1593,True,2025-01-01
39609545,Therapeutic landscape of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its severe subgroup metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) have become a global epidemic and are driven by chronic overnutrition and multiple genetic susceptibility factors. The physiological outcomes include hepatocyte death, liver inflammation and cirrhosis. The first therapeutic for MASLD and MASH, resmetirom, has recently been approved for clinical use and has energized this therapeutic space. However, there is still much to learn in clinical studies of MASH, such as the scale of placebo responses, optimal trial end points, the time required for fibrosis reversal and side effect profiles. This Review introduces aspects of disease pathogenesis related to drug development and discusses two main therapeutic approaches. Thyroid hormone receptor-β agonists, such as resmetirom, as well as fatty acid synthase inhibitors, target the liver and enable it to function within a toxic metabolic environment. In parallel, incretin analogues such as semaglutide improve metabolism, allowing the liver to self-regulate and reversing many aspects of MASH. We also discuss how combinations of therapeutics could potentially be used to treat patients.",2025,Mar,Nature reviews. Drug discovery,Albert Do; Frhaan Zahrawi; Wajahat Z Mehal,1235,True,2025-03-01
41100481,Investigating the common genetic basis between inflammatory bowel disease and metabolic syndrome through genomic structural equation modeling.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) exhibit a complex interplay, with clinical evidence indicating an increasing incidence of their co-occurrence. However, current research lacks a systematic framework to model the pleiotropic genetic architecture linking gastrointestinal and liver-metabolic phenotypes, thereby hindering a comprehensive understanding of how multiple genetic risk factors converge to drive IBD-MetS comorbidity. This study employed genomic structural equation modeling (SEM) to integrate genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary datasets for IBD and MetS-related traits (body mass index, triglycerides, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes), creating the multivariate GWAS summary datasets. Post-GWAS analytical approaches were subsequently utilized to assess risky loci, gene functionality, and tissue-specific regulatory networks, aiming to elucidate the pathological connections between chronic low-grade inflammation and the gut-liver-metabolic axis. Genomic SEM identified a shared latent genetic factor between IBD and MetS (Comparative Fit Index = 0.9864, Standardized Root Mean Square Residual = 0.0602). A total of 522 lead single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci were identified, including 21 novel SNPs specific to the multivariate model that were not detected in univariate GWAS. Fine-mapping with SuSiE and FINEMAP identified 29 high-confidence causal SNPs. Integrating SNP fine-mapping with MAGMA, FUSION, and FOCUS analyses confirmed seven core genes. To the best of our knowledge, this study provides the first comprehensive characterization of the shared genetic architecture of IBD and MetS through a multivariate genetic model. The results deepen the understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying IBD and MetS and offer potential therapeutic targets and a conceptual framework for developing interventions for cross-system diseases.",2025,01,PloS one,Pan Shen; Hao Xiong; Qing-Hua Luo; Yi-Fan Ding; Wei Ge; Wu Liao; Lei-Chang Zhang,1940,True,2025-01-01
36468574,Pharmacotherapeutic efficacy on noninvasive fibrosis progression in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Fibrosis impacts long-term outcomes among patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Due to well-documented flaws associated with liver biopsy, there has been a recent emphasis on prioritizing noninvasive testing over liver biopsy for the assessment of fibrosis. A comprehensive systematic review and frequentist random effects network meta-analysis was performed among randomized controlled trials reporting pharmacologic intervention in NAFLD. The primary endpoint was the absolute change in liver stiffness measurement (LSM) via elastography. Secondary endpoints included changes in noninvasive serologic tests including APRI, fibrosis-4 index, NAFLD fibrosis score, enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) and FibroTest (FibroSure in the USA). Forty-five randomized controlled trials enrolling 6932 patients were identified for this network meta-analysis. Across the primary endpoint, firsocostat, semaglutide, montelukast, cilofexor plus firsocostat, obeticholic acid and diacerein (change in LSM via vibration controlled transient elastography), in addition to lubiprostone and pemafibrate (change in LSM via magnetic resonance elastography) were found to be the most effective and statistically significant treatment interventions. Similarly, the following interventions were determined to be most effective as compared to placebo among secondary endpoints: saroglitazar, lubiprostone, and obeticholic acid (change in APRI); saroglitazar, semaglutide, firsocostat and cilofexor plus firsocostat (change in ELF); obeticholic acid and belapectin [change in FibroTest/FibroSure]. This is the first systematic review and network meta-analysis reporting pharmacologic efficacy in the progression of fibrosis based on noninvasive testing among patients with NAFLD. Semaglutide, obeticholic acid, firsocostat, cilofexor plus firsocostat and lubiprostone were found to be the most effective treatments based on their consistent efficacy reproduced across multiple endpoints, both via elastography and noninvasive blood tests.",2023,Jan,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,Alexander J Kovalic; Martin Gozar; Ben L Da; David Bernstein; Sanjaya K Satapathy,2028,True,2023-01-01
37834051,Understanding the Relationship between Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Thyroid Disease.,"The prevalence of hypothyroidism in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is high (22.4%). Thyroid hormones (THs) regulate many metabolic activities in the liver by promoting the export and oxidation of lipids, as well as de novo lipogenesis. They also control hepatic insulin sensitivity and suppress hepatic gluconeogenesis. Because of its importance in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, the involvement of thyroid dysfunction in the pathogenesis of NAFLD seems plausible. The mechanisms implicated in this relationship include high thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels, low TH levels, and chronic inflammation. The activity of the TH receptor (THR)-β in response to THs is essential in the pathogenesis of hypothyroidism-induced NAFLD. Therefore, an orally active selective liver THR-β agonist, Resmetirom (MGL-3196), was developed, and has been shown to reduce liver fat content, and as a secondary end point, to improve nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. The treatment of NAFLD with THR-β agonists seems quite promising, and other agonists are currently under development and investigation. This review aims to shine a light on the pathophysiological and epidemiological evidence regarding this relationship and the effect that treatment with THs and selective liver THR-β agonists have on hepatic lipid metabolism.",2023,Sep,International journal of molecular sciences,Paulina Vidal-Cevallos; Sofía Murúa-Beltrán Gall; Misael Uribe; Norberto C Chávez-Tapia,1338,True,2023-09-01
41140453,Effect of sleep apnoea interventions on multiple health outcomes: an umbrella review of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials.,"Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a prevalent chronic condition that is associated with cardiometabolic and neurocognitive complications. While continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) remains the first-line therapy, suboptimal adherence limits its effectiveness, highlighting the need to evaluate alternatives such as mandibular advancement devices (MADs), hypoglossal nerve stimulation (HNS), physical activity, different modalities of weight loss management including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and combination therapies. We conducted an umbrella review to synthesise high-level evidence from meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy, adherence, and safety of therapies used in patients with OSA. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews covering the period from January 1, 2017, to July 5, 2025. Eligible studies were meta-analyses published in English assessing interventions targeting key OSA outcomes, including changes in apnoea-hypopnoea index (AHI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), quality of life (QoL), blood pressure (BP), treatment adherence, and safety. When multiple meta-analyses addressed the same intervention-outcome pair, the one including the highest number of RCTs was retained. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Methodological quality was assessed using the AMSTAR 2 tool, and the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework. Meta-analyses published in languages other than English, those focusing on paediatric populations or interventions outside the scope of conventional OSA management, and meta-analyses that did not report any of the pre-specified outcomes/interventions of interest were excluded. The review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023420729) and the Open Science Framework (https://osf.io/2jvsx). A total of 5571 meta-analyses were identified. Of these, 34 met the inclusion criteria, encompassing 230 RCTs and 36,353 participants (n = 26,058 [72.3%] male). GRADE assessment showed that 12 meta-analyses (35%) had evidence that was of low certainty, 23 (68%) provided moderate-certainty evidence, and only one (3%) provided evidence that was of high certainty. CPAP was the most effective treatment for reducing AHI (mean difference [MD] -30.7 events/h; standardised mean difference [SMD] -1.65, 95% confidence interval [CI] -1.87 to -1.43; low-certainty evidence), followed by GLP-1 receptor agonists (tirzepatide: MD -21.86 events/h; SMD -0.84, 95% CI -1.01 to -0.68; moderate-certainty evidence) and MADs (MD -11.91 events/h; SMD -0.73, 95% CI -14.25 to -9.75; low-certainty evidence). CPAP, wake stimulants, HNS, and myofunctional therapy significantly reduced daytime sleepiness (ESS score SMDs of -0.80 to -0.88; moderate-certainty evidence except for pitolisant and solriamfetol, which were supported by high-certainty evidence). Physical activity led to the greatest improvements in QoL (SMD 1.3, 95% CI 0.58 to 2.02; moderate-certainty evidence), while CPAP also showed modest benefits (SMD 0.16, 95% CI 0.11 to 0.21; critically low-certainty evidence). This umbrella review identified CPAP as the most effective intervention for reducing AHI and daytime sleepiness in patients with OSA, while physical activity yielded the greatest improvements in quality of life. Data on safety, long-term adherence, and combination therapies remain scarce, underscoring the need for more comparative and longitudinal research to support personalised treatment strategies. Data need to be interpreted in the context of several limitations, including those relating to the meta-analysis inclusion criteria and the quality of data in the meta-analyses themselves.

41058623,Novel obesity and metabolic indices better predict non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in elderly T2DM patients: evidence from cross-sectional and longitudinal analysis.,"The associations between obesity- and metabolism-related indices and the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in elderly patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate these associations and assess their predictive value for NAFLD in this high-risk population. A total of 789 elderly T2DM patients recruited between 2020 and 2022 were included in the cross-sectional analysis, and 382 patients without NAFLD were followed in the longitudinal cohort for a median of 25.37 months. Binary logistic regression and Cox models were used to assess associations between obesity- and metabolism-related indices and NAFLD risk. Kaplan-Meier curves, restricted cubic spline (RCS) models, subgroup analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were applied to explore these relationships further. In the cross-sectional analysis, all obesity- and metabolic-related indices were significantly and positively associated with NAFLD risk, with odds ratio (OR) ranging from 1.014 (95% CI: 1.010-1.018) for LAP to 3.288 (95% CI: 2.414-4.533) for WHtR. RCS analysis revealed significant nonlinear associations for LAP, MetS scores, VAI, CMI, METS-IR, and ABSI. In the cohort analysis, 67 participants developed NAFLD, with an incidence rate of 8.35 per 100 person-years. Baseline LAP (HR = 3.10, 95% CI: 1.48-6.51), and MetS scores (HR = 4.26, 95% CI: 1.99-9.11) were independently associated with increased risk of incident NAFLD. Subgroup analysis demonstrated consistent positive associations across most subgroups. Time-dependent ROC analysis showed that LAP had the highest AUCs at 24 months (AUC = 0.725). The findings from cross-sectional and cohort studies collectively supported that MetS score and LAP may be the most effective predictive indicators for the risk of NAFLD among Chinese elderly T2DM Patients.",2025,01,Frontiers in medicine,Mingjie Xu; Yushuang Wei; Lingyu Ye; Boteng Yan; Shengzhu Huang; Zengnan Mo; Mingli Li,1875,True,2025-01-01
40159342,Concordance of vibration-controlled transient elastography and magnetic resonance elastography for fibrosis staging in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"To evaluate the concordance between vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) for staging liver fibrosis and assessing hypothetical eligibility for resmetirom treatment in a cohort of patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). A secondary objective was to assess the performance of VCTE for liver fat quantification. This retrospective study included 103 patients (61 males; mean age 54.7 years) with suspected MASLD who underwent VCTE and MRI/MRE. The following parameters were extracted: liver stiffness (LS) from both techniques, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) from VCTE, and MRI-proton density fat fraction (PDFF). Agreement and fibrosis stage distributions were assessed using Cohen's Kappa and McNemar's tests. ROC analysis assessed the performance of CAP against MRI-PDFF (considered the reference for steatosis). A significant difference was observed in assigned fibrosis stage distributions between VCTE and MRE across all combinations (F0-F1 vs F2-F4, F0-F2 vs F3-F4, F0-F3 vs F4, all p < 0.001) with fair to moderate agreement between modalities (Cohen's Kappa values 0.305-0.554). VCTE assigned a higher fibrosis stage in 42 patients (40.7%). Thirty-three vs eighteen patients were classified as F2-F3 (qualified for resmetirom treatment) with VCTE vs MRE (Cohen's Kappa 0.215), which was associated with estimated cost savings of $707,701/year with MRE. VCTE-CAP achieved AUCs of 0.547, 0.754, and 0.813 for diagnosing mild, moderate, and severe steatosis, respectively. VCTE and MRE have fair to moderate agreement for fibrosis staging, with VCTE tending to assign a higher fibrosis stage compared to MRE. VCTE-CAP reliably detects only severe steatosis. Question What is the agreement between VCTE and MRE in staging fibrosis in MASLD and identifying patients with F2-F3 disease? Findings Limited concordance was found between VCTE and MRE for staging liver fibrosis and identifying F2-F3 disease; VCTE tended to assign higher fibrosis stages compared to MRE.

41118356,Trichiasis with and without tarsal conjunctival scarring: A multi-country observational study.,"There has been discussion regarding the definition of the clinical sign trachomatous trichiasis (TT) for the purposes of determining elimination of trachoma as a public health problem, and whether the definition should include the presence of trachomatous scarring (TS). A multi-country observational study was conducted in Ethiopia, Uganda and Nigeria to assess whether TS grading by field graders using the WHO simplified system in trachoma surveys are comparable with expert grading of tarsal conjunctival scarring (TCS) using a detailed system. The primary outcome was the proportion of eyes graded as ""No TS"" in the surveys but with TCS from expert photographic grading (the negative predictive value, NPV). In Ethiopia, Uganda and Nigeria, 545 (438 trichiasis cases and 107 comparisons), 256 (156 trichiasis cases and 100 comparisons), and 468 (352 trichiasis cases and 116 comparisons) participants, respectively, were enrolled. In Ethiopia, among 111 trichiatic eyes graded ""No TS"" in the surveys, 103 (92.8%) had TCS in expert photo grading, NPV 7.2% (95% CI 3.2%-13.7%). In Uganda, among 28 trichiatic eyes graded ""No TS"" in the surveys, 19 (67.9%) had TCS in expert photo grading, NPV 32.1% (95% CI 15.9%-52.4%). In Nigeria, among 111 trichiatic eyes graded ""No TS"" in the surveys, 100 (90.1%) had TCS in expert photo grading, NPV 9.9% (95% CI 5.0%-17.0%). Across settings, among eyes misdiagnosed as ""No TS"" in the survey, 174/250 (69.6%) had extensive TCS (patches of scarring occupying ≥1/3 of the upper tarsal conjunctiva). Trichiatic eyes with TCS had more severe entropion, trichiasis, conjunctival inflammation, and corneal opacity than those without TCS. In all three settings, including TS to define a trichiasis ""trachomatous"" in a survey could result in the underestimation of the burden of TT. However, TCS can be effectively used to determine TT severity and management.",2025,01,PLOS global public health,Esmael Habtamu; Caleb Mpyet; Francis Mugume; Gladys Atto; Fikre Seife; Gilbert Baayenda; Sharone Backers; Ana Bakhtiari; Zerihun Tadesse; Scott D Nash; E Kelly Callahan; Scott Mcpherson; Emma M Harding-Esch; David Macleod; Michaela Kelly; Tom Millar; Victor Hu; Paul Courtright; Matthew Burton,1895,True,2025-01-01

41170420,"Gut microbiota heterogeneity in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: a narrative review of drivers, mechanisms, and clinical relevance.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a prevalent metabolic disorder, is increasingly recognized as a complex condition influenced by gut microbiota dysbiosis. However, the heterogeneity in findings across studies has hindered the clinical translation of microbiota-based interventions. In this narrative review, we synthesize current evidence on gut microbial alterations in patients with NAFLD, with a focus on the sources of variability that contribute to inconsistent results. We included human studies (2000-2024) that compared gut microbiota profiles between NAFLD patients and healthy controls using 16S rRNA or metagenomic sequencing; key drivers of microbial changes include clinical factors (metabolic comorbidities, disease progression), biological variables (diet, genetics), and methodological biases (sequencing platform differences, diagnostic criteria variability). Emerging evidence highlights the role of non-bacterial components (fungi, viruses) in modulating bacterial communities and disrupting host metabolic pathways, exacerbating hepatic inflammation and lipid accumulation. To overcome current limitations, we propose integrating multi-omics approaches (metagenomics, metabolomics, and proteomics) with a longitudinal study design to capture dynamic microbiota-host interactions. Precision microbiota therapies, including strain-specific probiotics, engineered microbial consortia, and fecal microbiota transplantation tailored to individual dysbiosis profiles, are emerging as promising strategies for targeted interventions. Addressing these challenges is essential to identifying reliable microbial biomarkers and developing personalized strategies for NAFLD prevention and treatment. Future research should harmonize methodologies, validate causal mechanisms, and optimize microbiota-based therapies to bridge experimental findings and clinical application.",2025,01,Frontiers in microbiology,Ying Guo; Naisi Zhang; Dongmei Pei,1892,True,2025-01-01

This study aims to provide a comprehensive global estimate of MAFLD prevalence in this population. A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted using data from PubMed, Embase, Medline, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), and Web of Science, up to May 10, 2024. We included studies that diagnosed MAFLD in children and adolescents aged 1 to 19 years using histological, imaging, or blood biomarker evidence. The prevalence rates were analyzed, and subgroup analyses were performed based on continent, development status, time period, sample source, diagnostic technique, and body mass index (BMI). The analysis included 176 studies with a total of 57,058 participants. The global prevalence of MAFLD among children and adolescents with overweight and/or obesity was 41.2% (95% CI 39.7-44.6). Significant geographical variations were observed, with the highest prevalence in North America (43.6%) and the lowest in Africa (31.1%). Studies conducted after 2010 reported higher prevalence rates (42.5%) compared to those before 2010 (38.2%). Hospital-based studies showed the highest prevalence (42.5%), while community-based studies reported lower rates. Liver biopsy yielded the highest prevalence (51.2%) among diagnostic methods.

The aim of this meta-analysis was to examine the long-term effects of these medications. A meta-analysis was performed following PRISMA guidelines. Data were collected on weight change, type 2 diabetes, and hypertension prevalence with GLP-1 or placebo therapy in studies meeting inclusion criteria per study protocol. A total of 54 articles and 59,856 patients were included in this study. GLP-1-treated patients were noted to lose an average of 10.6% of total body weight (TBW) compared to placebo at 3.9%, with a peak occurring at 12-18 months of treatment. When subdivided into intention-to-treat and adherent patients, those maintaining medication use lost more weight at a peak of 12% TBW loss. Weight regain with medication discontinuation was found to occur within weeks at a rate of 0.55% original TBW per month. The incident rate of type 2 diabetes was reduced sevenfold by GLP therapy over placebo. Hypertension resolution was also noted to be higher in the GLP-1-treated patients at a peak of 23% reduction compared to 11% for placebo. GLP-1 medications are effective at weight reduction and can produce diabetes and hypertension remission. Medication adherence is critical for efficacy, and non-compliance dramatically reduces the impact of these therapies.

41071622,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, insulin resistance and hepatocellular carcinoma: A deadly triad.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, driven by the increasing prevalence of obesity and insulin resistance (IR). IR, a central feature of the metabolic syndrome, promotes hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction, fostering the transition from steatosis to advanced liver injury and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This review summarizes current evidence on the molecular mechanisms linking MASLD, IR and HCC, highlighting the role of insulin resistance in liver carcinogenesis and disease progression. A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify experimental, clinical and epidemiological studies addressing the interplay between MASLD, IR and HCC. Key molecular pathways and risk profiles were synthesised and compared across etiologies. IR contributes to hepatic lipid deposition, oxidative stress and chronic inflammation through activation of PI3K/Akt and mTOR signalling. The coexistence of MASLD and IR enhances pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic pathways, accelerating the evolution to HCC. Patients with MASLD-associated HCC exhibit distinct metabolic and molecular characteristics compared with those with viral or alcohol-related HCC. Novel biomarkers and advanced imaging modalities show promise for identifying high-risk individuals at earlier disease stages. Although substantial progress has been made in understanding the MASLD-IR-HCC axis, critical gaps remain regarding genetic, environmental and metabolic determinants.

41099689,Prevalence and Associations of Systemic Inflammation in Heart Failure Across the Spectrum of Ejection Fraction.,"Systemic inflammation contributes to the pathophysiology of heart failure (HF). Inflammation in heart failure with mildly reduced ejection fraction (HFmrEF) or heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) has been linked to cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic conditions, whereas inflammation in heart failure and reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is thought to develop secondary to cardiac stress and circulatory derangements. This study aims to characterize the prevalence and correlates of systemic inflammation across the spectrum of HF. Patients with HF participating in 3 large outcome trials (SELECT, SOUL, and FLOW) were examined to identify the prevalence of systemic inflammation, defined as elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) ≥2 mg/L. Clinical characteristics associated with elevated hsCRP were examined by HF subtype and across the HF spectrum. Across the 3 trials, 3,204 patients had HFpEF, 1,246 had HFmrEF, and 1,018 had HFrEF. Elevated hsCRP was observed in 2,335 patients (52.5%) with HFpEF/HFmrEF and 503 patients (49.4%) with HFrEF. Compared with patients with lower hsCRP levels, those with higher hsCRP levels were more likely to be female and have obesity, diabetes, lower estimated glomerular filtration rate, higher albuminuria, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, without meaningful differences by HF subtype. hsCRP level was unrelated to ejection fraction (R Systemic inflammation is present in one-half of patients with HF, and is associated with excess body fat, chronic kidney disease, albuminuria, and diabetes, and increases with comorbidity burden.

The evolving nomenclature and understanding of MASLD necessitate updated insights into its pathophysiology, diagnostics, and internal medicine management. A comprehensive literature review was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane databases for articles published between 2018 and 2025. Eligible studies included human-based clinical or translational research addressing MASLD pathogenesis, diagnostics, and management. Non-invasive scoring systems, pharmacotherapies, and multidisciplinary management strategies were evaluated. The pathological progression of MASLD spans from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Key pathogenic mechanisms involve insulin resistance, adipokine imbalance, gut-liver axis dysregulation, and genetic polymorphisms such as PNPLA3. Diagnostic approaches have shifted toward non-invasive tools, including Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), NAFLD Fibrosis Score, Enhanced Liver Fibrosis (ELF) score, Vibration-Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE), and magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). Lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of management, but promising pharmacologic therapies, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, vitamin E, pioglitazone, and resmetirom, are emerging.

Its increasing incidence is closely linked with rising rates of obesity, Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and metabolic syndrome. MASLD includes a spectrum of liver pathologies such as fibrosis, cirrhosis, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). This review explores diagnostic advancements and therapeutic developments, focusing on Resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor-beta (THR-β) agonist, as a novel pharmacologic intervention. The review draws upon current literature, clinical guidelines, and data from pivotal randomized controlled trials to evaluate the diagnostic criteria, non-invasive assessment tools, lifestyle recommendations, and emerging pharmacotherapy for MASLD and MASH, focusing on Resmetirom. Resmetirom has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing hepatic fat content and improving markers of liver fibrosis in patients with noncirrhotic MASH and fibrosis stages F2-F3. Clinical trials showed improved liver histology, lipid profiles, and MASH resolution without fibrosis progression. Despite its promising profile, gastrointestinal side effects and gallstone-related complications have been observed. Long-term safety and outcomes related to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma prevention remain under investigation. MASLD is a significant public health concern driven by metabolic dysfunction. While lifestyle changes remain central to management, Resmetirom offers a promising pharmacological option for patients with moderate to advanced MASH.

Spatial heterogeneity in liver stiffness (LS) by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) was compared in patients with PSC and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Variability of LS was defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum LS divided by the maximum LS. The coefficient of variation (CoV) was calculated as the SD of LS divided by the mean of LS. MREs were classified as homogenous or heterogenous if the variability of LS was less than or greater than the mean variability, respectively. A total of 105 patients (PSC: n=66, MASLD: n=39) were included. In both PSC and MASLD, the variability of LS increased with increasing mean LS (r=0.31, p=0.01 and r=0.57, p=0.0002, respectively). CoV correlated with mean LS in patients with MASLD (r=0.34, p=0.03), but not PSC (r=0.19, p=0.12).

The metabolic conditions, such as obesity with ectopic fat accumulation, serve as one of the risk factors of MASLD. The pathogenesis of MASLD may be attributed to the impaired systemic lipid metabolism as well as activation of de novo lipogenesis transcription factors, such as ChREBP and SREBP-1C, in the liver. The combined effects of both systemic dyslipidaemia and hyperactive hepatic de novo lipogenesis have been widely associated with the onset and progression of MASLD from steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatosis hepatitis (MASH). Moreover, systemic insulin resistance and impaired hepatic insulin function also correlate with the onset of MASLD. People living with HIV (PLWHIV) have been reported to be more susceptible to the development of MASLD. However, whether this could be attributed to the chronic use of antiretroviral therapy treatments (ART) or the detrimental effects of the virus remains the subject of research. Over the past decades, different regimens of ART, including highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), have been introduced. However, some of the HAART regimen drugs are continually being discontinued citing a variety of side effects, including metabolic derangements. Furthermore, the recent developments on GLP-1 agonists showing the cardioprotective and antidiabetic effects have elicited increasing interest in their potential repurposing for the treatment of MASLD.

38772519,Resmetirom's approval: Highlighting the need for comprehensive approaches in NASH therapeutics.,"The recent FDA approval of Rezdiffra (resmetirom), an oral partial agonist of the thyroid hormone receptor-beta (THR-beta), for the treatment of noncirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with moderate to advanced fibrosis, has challenged conventional approaches to NASH drug development. Despite extensive efforts targeting typical pathways involved in NASH progression, such as lipogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammation, these approaches have yet to yield any approved therapies. The success of resmetirom highlights the potential advantages of targeting THR-beta, which exerts pleiotropic effects on multiple pathways involved in NASH pathogenesis, including lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and inflammation. In the phase 3 MAESTRONASH trial, resmetirom significantly improved NASH resolution, fibrosis, and LDL cholesterol levels compared to placebo, with a favorable safety profile. The tissue-specific action of resmetirom may also contribute to its efficacy and safety. The approval of resmetirom has opened new avenues for NASH drug development, emphasizing the importance of exploring novel mechanisms of action, developing targeted therapies, and embracing a more comprehensive approach to treatment. As the global burden of NASH continues to grow, the lessons learned from the success of resmetirom should inform future drug development strategies, offering hope to the millions of patients affected by this disease worldwide.",2024,Aug,Clinics and research in hepatology and gastroenterology,Salah Abdalrazak Alshehade,1458,True,2024-08-01
41087864,Helicobacter pylori infection impairs glucose homeostasis through gut microbiota dysbiosis.,"Epidemiological data show that Helicobacter pylori (H. pylori) infection is not only the most important risk factor for gastric cancer, but is also associated with poor glycemic control in patients with diabetes. However, the direct causal and functional relationship between H. pylori infection and dysglycemia is unclear. A retrospective cohort study was conducted to examine the association between H. pylori infection and glycemic levels in individuals with Type 2 diabetes. C57BL/6 diabetic mice were infected with H. pylori, and the resulting changes in colonic inflammation and intestinal Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion were thoroughly examined using immunohistochemistry, RNA sequencing, metagenomic sequencing, and targeted metabolomics. The microbial and metabolomics profiles were analyzed and compared in antibiotic-treated mice through fecal transfer experiments. H. pylori infection aggravated insulin resistance in diabetic individuals and mice. We identified a unique H. pylori-induced epithelial inflammation and reduced intestinal GLP-1 secretion in the colon. H. pylori infection also interrupts the normal microbial composition in the colon, leading to a decrease in SCFA-producing bacteria and a reduction in acetic and propionate acids. Similar changes were observed in antibiotic-treated mice after receiving fecal transplants from H. pylori-infected diabetic mice. In vitro studies revealed that the intestinal flora of H. pylori-positive diabetic mice inhibited proglucagon transcription, cAMP levels, and GLP-1 secretion in colonic endocrine cells, with SCFA supplementation reversing this effect on GLP-1 production. These microbial, metabolic, and GLP-1 alterations were also seen in antibiotic-treated mice after receiving fecal transplants from H. pylori-infected diabetic mice. H. pylori eradication with antibiotics improved glucose metabolism and GLP-1 secretion to levels comparable to uninfected controls. Our studies offer evidence that H. pylori infection significantly contributes to the progression of glucose impairment and insulin resistance. Therefore, incorporating H. pylori status into preventive strategies for diabetes should be taken into account.

41079592,Dynamic profiles of 25 serum biomarkers in acute myocardial infarction.,"Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is a leading cause of cardiovascular mortality and perioperative complications in the elderly (>65 years). However, existing clinical biomarkers (e.g., troponin) still lack sufficient sensitivity for ultra-early diagnosis. A comprehensive understanding of the dynamic changes in serum biomarkers post-AMI is crucial for developing novel diagnostic strategies. A rat AMI model was established by surgical ligation of the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery. Cardiac function was evaluated via echocardiography and triphenyltetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining at 24 h post-AMI. Blood samples were collected at baseline (pre-anesthesia) and at 1, 2, 6, 12, 24, and 48 h post-LAD ligation. Serum levels of 25 biomarkers were measured by ELISA, including: α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA), aminopeptidase N (ANPEP), B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2), C-reactive protein (CRP), connective tissue growth factor (CTGF), C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 16 (CXCL16), cystatin C (Cys), dopamine D2 receptor (D2D), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), homocysteine (Hcy), chemokine-like factor 1 (CKLF1), high-sensitivity troponin I (hs-TnI), interleukin-1β (IL-1β), interleukin-6 (IL-6), lipoprotein(a) (Lp-α), monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), matrix metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9), NOD-like receptor family pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3), plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), S100 calcium-binding protein A8 (S100A8), solute carrier family 31 member 1 (copper transporter, SLC31A1), tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (TIMP-1), tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A). At 24 h post-AMI, LVEF was significantly decreased in the AMI group (63.84 ± 2.48% vs. 38.83 ± 2.62%,  This study is the first to systematically characterize the dynamic profiles of 25 serum biomarkers following AMI in rats, revealing that: (1) IL-1β, S100A8, BNP, SLC31A1 and Cys may serve as an ultra-early (1 h) diagnostic panel (increase of over 70% at 1 h); (2) the delayed elevation of α-SMA and CXCL16 may be associated with the initiation of myocardial repair; (3) the suppression of Lp-α and D2D might reflect compensatory protective mechanisms.",2025,01,Frontiers in cardiovascular medicine,Xuefeng Ai; Yuanyuan Wang; Mingwei Jiang; Qianyu Han; Hongli Geng; Cheng Wang; Jirui Chen; Lei Xue; Yuxiang Jin,2252,True,2025-01-01

We report a case of subjective olfactory discomfort that developed during AOM therapy despite normal objective test results. A 41-year-old woman received the GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide for 24 weeks. Thorough olfactory function evaluation was performed using the Questionnaire of Olfactory Disorders (a validated questionnaire), the Yonsei Olfactory Function Test (for psychophysical testing), and chemical gustometry. The tests were performed before treatment and after 24 weeks of AOM therapy. At baseline, the patient had no olfactory complaints and showed normal test results. After treatment, she reported significant subjective olfactory discomfort (visual analog scale score: 48, maximum: 50), with decreased quality of life and parosmia, despite stable Yonsei Olfactory Function scores and normal gustatory function. This case highlights the possible mismatch between subjective and objective olfactory assessment during AOM therapy.

41137915,The epigenetic roles of pirfenidone - implication in liver disease management.,"Liver diseases represent a major global health challenge, responsible for over two million deaths annually. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its progressive form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), are the primary contributors to liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinoma (HCC). Epigenetic mechanisms, including DNA methylation, histone modifications, and miRNAs, play a crucial role in the pathogenesis of liver disorders, presenting promising therapeutic targets due to their reversibility. Pirfenidone, an antifibrotic agent approved for idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) and hepatic fibrosis in Mexico, has shown significant potential to modulate epigenetic pathways. This review discusses the molecular and epigenetic mechanisms by which PFD exerts hepatoprotective effects, including modulation of miRNA expression, restoration of DNA methylation patterns, and regulation of histone acetylation and methylation. Notable findings include PFD-mediated downregulation of pro-fibrotic miRNAs, hypermethylation of TGFB1, and inhibition of JMJD2B histone demethylase. Together, these findings suggest that PFD not only targets fibrotic and inflammatory pathways but also acts as a novel epigenetic regulator, positioning it as a promising therapeutic candidate for MASLD, MASH, and HCC.",2025,Oct,Epigenomics,Rebeca Rosas-Campos; Adriana Franco-Acevedo; Juan Armendariz-Borunda,1340,True,2025-10-01
41030572,Fabrication and Preclinical Evaluation of Hyaluronic Acid/Aminoclay Nanocomposite Microneedles for Noninvasive Delivery of Semaglutide in Anti-Obesity Therapy.,"Injectable formulations are common for protein-based therapeutics. However, non-injectable formulations are crucial for improving patient compliance. This study aims to develop hyaluronic acid/aminoclay-based dissolving microneedles as a noninvasive delivery system for semaglutide in the treatment of obesity. The core nanocomplex (Sema-AC) was formed by combining semaglutide (Sema) with aminoclay (AC) via electrostatic interaction. This nanocomplex was then mixed with hyaluronic acid (HA) of varying molecular weights and poured into a reverse polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) mold to create dissolving microneedles (MNs). Various in vitro and in vivo studies were performed to evaluate the physicochemical properties and therapeutic efficacy of the MNs. Among the developed MNs, Sema-AC/HA10 demonstrated a mechanical strength of 0.37 ± 0.020 N/needle and retained stable physicochemical and morphological properties at 25°C during storage. Encapsulated Sema retained its conformational stability within the MNs. Sema-AC/HA10 dissolved rapidly upon skin insertion, enabling efficient transdermal drug absorption. The MNs containing Sema-AC nanocomplex significantly enhanced the systemic drug exposure compared to the MN loaded with the free drug. Consequently, Sema-AC/HA10 demonstrated in vivo efficacy comparable to that of subcutaneous Sema injection in type 2 diabetic rats, significantly reducing blood glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol, triglycerides, food intake, water consumption, and body weight"". These findings suggest that Sema-AC/HA10 is an effective transdermal delivery system for semaglutide.",2025,01,International journal of nanomedicine,Chang Rim Woo; Gyu Lin Kim; Hyo-Kyung Han,1612,True,2025-01-01

41063544,Flavonoids in Metabolic Disease: A Narrative Review of Mechanisms and Therapeutic Potential.,"Flavonoids, natural bioactive compounds found in plants, are increasingly recognized for their potential to manage metabolic disorders such as diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Their robust antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic regulatory capabilities enhance their therapeutic prospects. This narrative review thoroughly examines the mechanisms of flavonoids in combating metabolic diseases, highlighting their effects on insulin resistance, lipid metabolism, hepatic fat deposition, and chronic inflammation. Evidence was obtained from literature published through searches of PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase using keywords related to flavonoids and metabolic dysregulation. Derived from traditional Chinese medicine, these monomers improve insulin sensitivity, enhance fatty acid oxidation, decrease lipogenesis, and curb inflammatory responses via NF-κB and JAK/STAT pathways by activating key regulators like AMPK, SIRT1, PPAR-γ, and Nrf2. Additionally, flavonoids contribute to metabolic stability by influencing the gut microbiota, elevating short-chain fatty acid levels, and bolstering intestinal barrier integrity. Despite extensive research, the molecular targets, bioavailability, optimal dosing, and long-term safety of flavonoids remain insufficiently defined.

39796162,NAFLD and NAFLD Related HCC: Emerging Treatments and Clinical Trials.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), recently renamed metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), is the most prevalent liver disease worldwide. It is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in the background of cirrhosis or without cirrhosis. The prevalence of NAFLD-related HCC is increasing all over the globe, and HCC surveillance in NAFLD cases is not that common. In the present review, we attempt to summarize promising treatments and clinical trials focused on NAFLD, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and HCC in the past five to seven years. We categorized the trials based on the type of intervention. Most of the trials are still running, with only a few completed and with conclusive results. In clinical trial NCT03942822, 25 mg/day of milled chia seeds improved NAFLD condition. Completed trial NCT03524365 concluded that Rouxen-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) results in histological resolution of NASH without worsening of fibrosis, while NCT04677101 validated sensitivity/accuracy of blood biomarkers in predicting NASH and fibrosis stage. Moreover, trials with empagliflozin (NCT05694923), curcuvail (NCT06256926), and obeticholic acid (NCT03439254) were completed but did not provide conclusive results. However, trial NCT03900429 reported effective improvement in fibrosis by at least one stage, without worsening of NAFLD activity score (NAS), as well as improvement in lipid profile of the NASH patients by 80 or 100 mg MGL-3196 (resmetirom).

41015152,Weight loss reverses obesity-associated impairments in acute gastrointestinal stretch-induced suppression of food intake and glucose homeostasis.,"Chemical and mechanical signals from the gastrointestinal tract are critical for regulating satiety and glucose metabolism. While both nutrient sensing in the intestine and gastric distension has been well studied, the role of intestinal stretch in these metabolic processes remain unclear. This study evaluates the role of intestinal stretch in regulating food intake and glucose homeostasis in the context of normal body weight, obesity, and weight loss occurring via both dietary intervention and vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). We used the nonnutritive substance mannitol to selectively induce intestinal stretch in conscious mice. We assessed food intake, glucose tolerance, and neuronal activation in mice with normal body weight, obesity, or after dietary or surgically-induced weight loss. We employed chemogenetic approaches to inhibit GLP-1R and OxtR-expressing vagal afferents, and genetic and pharmacological strategies to ablate GLP-1 signaling to explore mechanisms for mannitol-induced suppression of feeding. Mannitol-induced intestinal stretch acutely suppressed food intake and improved oral glucose tolerance independent of GLP-1 signaling and vagal intestinal mechanosensation. Diet induced obesity impairs mannitol-induced intestinal stretch reductions in food intake and attenuates neuronal activation in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) upon induction of intestinal stretch. Both dietary and surgical weight loss restored intestinal stretch-induced feeding suppression and enhanced NTS neuronal activation. Importantly, VSG heightened NTS neuronal activation in response to oral but not IP glucose. Together, these data demonstrate that intestinal stretch contributes to the regulation of feeding and glucose metabolism independently of intestinal nutrient-sensing or classical gut hormones.",2025,Sep,Molecular metabolism,Maigen Bethea; Tyler Cook; Marwa Mommandi; Andrew McClennan; Allison Martin; Jasmine J Hendrix; Chelsea R Hutch; Alfor Lewis; Randy J Seeley; Henning Fenselau; Silvania da Silva Teixeria; Darleen A Sandoval,1825,True,2025-09-01
39061612,New Insights on Using Oral Semaglutide versus Dapagliflozin in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"Increases in both the prevalence and severity of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and obesity are closely related. Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) has been associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist approved for the treatment of T2DM and has an important role in weight loss. Also, it may represent a new therapeutic option for the treatment of MASH in obese diabetic patients. The main outcomes were changes from baseline in liver steatosis and fibrosis at week 24. A total of one hundred eighty-seven patients with T2DM were eligible for this prospective study; ninety-five subjects were treated with oral semaglutide, and ninety-two patients were treated with dapagliflozin as an add-on to metformin. All the subjects were evaluated using Vibration Controlled Transient Elastography (VCTE) from June to December 2022. From our cohort, 54% of the patients were females, with a mean age of 59.92 ± 11.89 years and a mean body mass index (BMI) of 29.53 ± 5.33 kg/m The superior metabolic effects of semaglutide, correlated to dapagliflozin, may contribute to a more efficient decrease in hepatic stress and injury, leading to a substantial enhancement of liver function in T2DM patients.

41083533,Integrating spatial and chemical information enhances differentiation of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis states in Raman imaging.,"Machine learning studies for Raman imaging have addressed the differentiability of normal and diseased states in biomedical applications by grouping a set of Raman spectra in terms of spectral similarity over the sample. However, Raman imaging provides both chemical information relevant to the underlying chemical species and their spatial distribution across the biological samples. Utilizing both the chemical and spatial information may further discriminate the sample states more than just using the spectral similarity free from the spatial structure. Here, we develop a Raman image analysis method integrating spatial and chemical information. The crux of our method is to introduce a measure to quantify spatial heterogeneity among Raman spectra at each pixel, and to classify Raman images using information theory, based not directly on the Raman spectra themselves at individual pixels but on the spatial heterogeneity in the spectral space over the surroundings. In this paper, we applied the method to a set of liver tissues dissected from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) rat model, each of which is pathologically classified into normal, nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), respectively. We show how the pathologically-identified liver states can be further classified using chemical information, and both chemical and spatial information. All NASH tissues that are belonging to a same cluster in spectral similarity are found to be further divided into substates that correlate the progression of the NAFLD disease, and subtle contamination of bloods that often prevents from appropriate pathological judgments. The potential of a use of both chemical and spatial information in Raman imaging is expected to enhance the differentiability of disease states of biological samples.",2025,Oct,Scientific reports,Ryoya Kondo; Yuta Mizuno; Kentaro Mochizuki; Kosuke Hashimoto; Jean-Emmanuel Clément; Yasuaki Kumamoto; Katsumasa Fujita; Yoshinori Harada; Tamiki Komatsuzaki,1841,True,2025-10-01
41102808,Lipid metabolism orchestrates liver regeneration: an integrated metabolic network.,"Liver regeneration is a tightly regulated biological process driven by the dynamic interplay of lipid metabolism, involving spatially and temporally coordinated pathways of synthesis, degradation, and lipophagy. This comprehensive review delineates the pivotal roles of lipid metabolic networks in liver regeneration and highlights their potential for clinical translation. During the priming phase, transient regenerative-associated steatosis (TRAS) serves important physiological roles which provide energy through β-oxidation and supply substrates for membrane phospholipid biosynthesis, with its regulation orchestrated by transcriptional and post-translational mechanisms. In contrast, chronic lipid dyshomeostasis impairs regeneration through mechanisms including endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and pro-inflammatory signaling. However, protective lipid-handling processes remain active and play pivotal roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis. Lipophagy-mediated selective degradation of lipid droplets (LDs) releases free fatty acids (FFAs), which mitigate oxidative stress and preserve hepatocellular integrity. Furthermore, the gut-liver axis modulates regeneration through microbiota-derived metabolites and incretin hormones that fine-tune the equilibrium between lipid mobilization and storage. Macrophage polarization-metabolic crosstalk emerges as a critical regulator, whereby PPARγ-driven lipogenic networks in reparative macrophages coordinate growth factor secretion and ER expansion via STAT3 activation. Paradoxically, while moderate TRAS supports regeneration through FFA-mediated histone acetylation and membrane raft signaling, pre-existing steatosis exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion injury via lipid peroxidation and necroptosis. Therapeutic strategies targeting lipophagy-ER stress interactions or gut-liver metabolic crosstalk demonstrate therapeutic potential. Future directions include elucidating dynamic lipid metabolic shifts, targeting gut microbiota-liver interactions, and advancing lipidomics-guided personalized therapies. By integrating mechanistic insights with clinical challenges, this review establishes a framework for understanding the metabolic logic underlying liver regeneration and advancing precision medicine in hepatic repair.",2025,Oct,Journal of translational medicine,Lian Duan; Yushun Chang; Jinyao Dai; Haowen Lu; Weijun Zhao; Yuxuan Shen; Jie Lin; Xiujun Cai,2310,True,2025-10-01

38823393,Metabolic reprogramming in liver fibrosis.,"Chronic liver diseases, primarily metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), harmful use of alcohol, or viral hepatitis, may result in liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer. Hepatic fibrogenesis is a complex process with interactions between different resident and non-resident heterogeneous liver cell populations, ultimately leading to deposition of extracellular matrix and organ failure. Shifts in cell phenotypes and functions involve pronounced transcriptional and protein synthesis changes that require metabolic adaptations in cellular substrate metabolism, including glucose and lipid metabolism, resembling changes associated with the Warburg effect in cancer cells. Cell activation and metabolic changes are regulated by metabolic stress responses, including the unfolded protein response, endoplasmic reticulum stress, autophagy, ferroptosis, and nuclear receptor signaling. These metabolic adaptations are crucial for inflammatory and fibrogenic activation of macrophages, lymphoid cells, and hepatic stellate cells.

38471571,"The Pathophysiological Associations Between Obesity, NAFLD, and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Diseases.","Obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases are common and growing public health concerns. Previous epidemiological studies unfolded the robust correlation between obesity, NAFLD, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Obesity is a well-known risk factor for NAFLD, and both of them can markedly increase the odds of atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. On the other hand, significant weight loss achieved by lifestyle modification, bariatric surgery, or medications, such as semaglutide, can concomitantly improve NAFLD and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, certain pathophysiological links are involved in the development of NAFLD in obesity, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases in obesity and NAFLD. Moreover, recent studies indicated that simultaneously targeting several mechanisms by tirzepatide and retatrutide leads to greater weight loss and markedly improves the complications of metabolic syndrome. These findings remind the importance of a mechanistic viewpoint for breaking the association between obesity, NAFLD, and atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases. In this review article, we mainly focus on shared pathophysiological mechanisms, including insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, GLP1 signaling, inflammation, oxidative stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, gut dysbiosis, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) overactivity, and endothelial dysfunction. Most of these pathophysiological alterations are primarily initiated by obesity. The development of NAFLD further exacerbates these molecular and cellular alterations, leading to atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease development or progression as the final manifestation of molecular perturbation. A better insight into these mechanisms makes it feasible to develop new multi-target approaches to simultaneously unhinge the deleterious chain of events linking obesity and NAFLD to atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases.",2024,Oct,Hormone and metabolic research = Hormon- und Stoffwechselforschung = Hormones et metabolisme,Meng Li; Man Cui; Guoxia Li; Yueqiu Liu; Yunsheng Xu; Seyed Parsa Eftekhar; Moein Ala,1985,True,2024-10-01

Despite their metabolic benefits, fragmented evidence and methodological limitations in pharmacovigilance systems hinder comprehensive risk characterization. This study aimed to systematically evaluate ocular toxicity signals associated with GLP-1 RAs using advanced signal mining across the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (FAERS) and VigiBase. Data from FAERS (2005-2025 Q1) and VigiBase (1987-2025 Q1) were analyzed for ocular AEs linked to five GLP-1 RAs (exenatide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, lixisenatide).

41076276,"Antibiotic consumption, genetic risk and incidence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: a prospective cohort study.","The association between antibiotic consumption and the risk of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remains ambiguous. This study aimed to investigate this relationship within a large prospective cohort from the UK Biobank. We conducted a prospective cohort study of 143,279 adults aged 40 to 70 years, among whom 1477 were diagnosed with MASLD for the first time. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models were employed to assess the data. The genetic risk score (GRS) for MASLD was derived from five single-nucleotide variants, and mediation analysis was performed to evaluate the role of metabolic syndrome (MetS). Our findings demonstrated that individuals with antibiotic exposure during childhood or adolescence exhibited a significantly higher risk of developing MASLD compared to those without antibiotic exposure (P < 0.001, HR 1.39; 95 % CI 1.21-1.59). No significant interaction was observed between antibiotic consumption and genetic predisposition for MASLD. Mediation analysis revealed that MetS and central obesity accounted for 21.98 % and 13.55 % of the association between early-life antibiotic exposure and MASLD, respectively (P < 0.001), particularly in women (P for interaction = 0.031). Long-term antibiotic exposure in early life was significantly associated with a higher risk of developing MASLD, and this association persisted after adjustment for genetic predisposition factors.",2025,Oct,Annals of hepatology,Ziming Zheng; Yumei Huang; Jijuan Zhang; Jinchi Xie; An Pan; Yunfei Liao; Yu Zhang,1460,True,2025-10-01
41007755,Contemporary and Emerging Therapeutics in Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic (CKM) Syndrome: In Memory of Professor Akira Endo.,"Cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome is a multifaceted, systemic disorder characterized by the interplay of cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic kidney disease (CKD), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and obesity. This review synthesizes current and emerging therapeutic strategies aimed at addressing the shared pathophysiologic mechanisms driving CKM progression, such as insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative stress, and neurohormonal activation. Established pharmacotherapies that include sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists like finerenone have demonstrated robust efficacy in reducing cardiovascular events, slowing renal decline, and improving metabolic outcomes. Additionally, novel agents targeting lipoprotein(a), interleukin-6, and hepatic fat accumulation are expanding the therapeutic landscape. RNA-based therapies, including antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), are designed to modulate lipoprotein(a) and PCSK9 expression. Artificial intelligence (AI) is also emerging as a transformative tool for personalized CKM management, enhancing risk prediction and clinical decision-making. The review highlights the relevance of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) as a CKM modifier and discusses the approval of resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor β agonist, for noncirrhotic MASH. By integrating evidence from clinical trials, mechanistic studies, and emerging technologies, this review provides a comprehensive resource for clinicians and researchers navigating the evolving field of CKM syndrome.",2025,Sep,Biomedicines,Inderjeet Singh Bharaj; Ajit Brar; Aayushi Kacheria; Karen Purewal; Austin Simister; Umabalan Thirupathy; Palak Gupta; Jasraj Kahlon; Juzer Munaim; Ei Ei Thwe; Samer Ibrahim; Valerie Martinez Vargas; Krishnaswami Vijayaraghavan,1728,True,2025-09-01
38852583,EASL-EASD-EASO Clinical Practice Guidelines on the Management of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD).,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as steatotic liver disease (SLD) in the presence of one or more cardiometabolic risk factor(s) and the absence of harmful alcohol intake. The spectrum of MASLD includes steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, previously NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This joint EASL-EASD-EASO guideline provides an update on definitions, prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment for MASLD. Case-finding strategies for MASLD with liver fibrosis, using non-invasive tests, should be applied in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, abnormal liver enzymes, and/or radiological signs of hepatic steatosis, particularly in the presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity with additional metabolic risk factor(s). A stepwise approach using blood-based scores (such as FIB-4) and, sequentially, imaging techniques (such as transient elastography) is suitable to rule-out/in advanced fibrosis, which is predictive of liver-related outcomes. In adults with MASLD, lifestyle modification - including weight loss, dietary changes, physical exercise and discouraging alcohol consumption - as well as optimal management of comorbidities - including use of incretin-based therapies (e.g. semaglutide, tirzepatide) for T2D or obesity, if indicated - is advised. Bariatric surgery is also an option in individuals with MASLD and obesity. If locally approved and dependent on the label, adults with non-cirrhotic MASH and significant liver fibrosis (stage ≥2) should be considered for a MASH-targeted treatment with resmetirom, which demonstrated histological effectiveness on steatohepatitis and fibrosis with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. No MASH-targeted pharmacotherapy can currently be recommended for the cirrhotic stage. Management of MASH-related cirrhosis includes adaptations of metabolic drugs, nutritional counselling, surveillance for portal hypertension and HCC, as well as liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis.",2024,01,Obesity facts,,2148,True,2024-01-01
41111575,Changes in eating behavior and diet-related quality of life in individuals treated with tirzepatide for type 2 diabetes.,"We investigated changes in eating behavior associated with the administration of tirzepatide and evaluated any changes in diet-related QOL due to tirzepatide. The study included 60 outpatients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who had been on tirzepatide for 3 months. The changes in body weight and HbA1c levels of all participants were observed for 3 months following the initiation of tirzepatide treatment. Simultaneously, we conducted a questionnaire survey that included questions on their eating behavior (Eating Behavior Questionnaire) and diet-related quality-of-Life (DDRQOL). HbA1c levels significantly reduced after the first month of administration from 7.40 ± 1.58% at the start to 6.78 ± 0.99% after 3 months (p < 0.001). Body weight also significantly decreased from 80.7 ± 13.2 kg at the start to 78.3 ± 12.9 kg after 3 months (p < 0.001). The total Eating Behavior Questionnaire score significantly reduced from 52.9 ± 10.9 points to 47.7 ± 9.9 points after 3 months (p < 0.001).

41144928,"Changes to insulin requirements over time with semaglutide in adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy: A post-hoc analysis of a double-blinded, randomised, crossover trial.","There is little data on how semaglutide affects basal versus bolus insulin and dosing parameters in adults with type 1 diabetes on insulin pump therapy. This is a post-hoc analysis of a double-blinded, randomised, crossover trial assessing semaglutide (up to 1 mg) versus placebo during automated insulin delivery (AID). This analysis focuses on the first 11 of 15 weeks where participants used their routine pump therapy with continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), where remote follow-ups were performed on days 7, 21, 32, 56, 63, and 77 (± 4 days). Changes in insulin requirements, carbohydrate input, and pump parameters over time compared to baseline were assessed, as well as the frequency of parameter adjustments. Twenty-six participants were included; 100% were using CGM and 81% using AID at baseline. Daily total and bolus insulin, along with carbohydrate input, were significantly reduced by day 7 and remained so, while basal was significantly reduced by day 32. By day 77, there was a median increase in carbohydrate ratios by 4.1% [-1.8, 7.7] and in correction factors by 11.2% [0.0, 20.8], and a reduction in pre-programmed basal rates by 7.9% [-12.7, -4.2]. The median time spent in hypoglycemia was rarely >4% during these follow-ups. Insulin needs decrease rapidly upon initiation of semaglutide use in type 1 diabetes on pump therapy, predominantly due to bolus changes from less carbohydrate consumption. While diabetes technology helps to reduce hypoglycemia, adjustments to pump dosing are still required.",2025,Oct,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Melissa-Rosina Pasqua; Michael A Tsoukas; Ahmad Haidar,1526,True,2025-10-01

Over the past decade, growing concern has emerged regarding the detrimental impact of air pollution on liver disease. Air pollutants, including particulate matter (PM) and chemical gases such as nitrogen oxides (NOx), can influence the microbiome in the lungs and gut by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS), which induce oxidative stress and local inflammation. This redox imbalance leads to the production of altered secondary microbial metabolites, potentially disrupting both the alveolar-capillary and gut barriers. Under these conditions, microbes and their metabolites can translocate to the liver, triggering inflammation and contributing to liver diseases, particularly metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This manuscript aims to review recent findings on the impact of air pollution on liver disease pathogenesis, exploring the molecular, genetic, and microbiome-related mechanisms underlying lung-gut-liver interactions, providing insights into potential strategies to prevent or mitigate liver disease progression.",2025,Sep,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",Jacopo Iaccarino; Irene Mignini; Rossella Maresca; Gabriele Giansanti; Giorgio Esposto; Raffaele Borriello; Linda Galasso; Maria Elena Ainora; Antonio Gasbarrini; Maria Assunta Zocco,1335,True,2025-09-01
41147597,Ultrasound Derived Fat Fraction (UDFF): An US Tool for Non-Invasive Diagnosis and Quantification of Hepatic Steatosis.,"The rising prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and the arrival of medical treatments have highlighted the need for accurate, accessible, and cost-effective methods for hepatic steatosis quantification. This study evaluates the performance of ultrasound-derived fat fraction (UDFF) for diagnosing and quantifying hepatic steatosis using MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) and liver biopsy as reference standards. UDFF was also compared with the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). A total of 114 patients with chronic liver disease were prospectively included. All patients underwent UDFF and MRI-PDFF; 78 patients also had liver biopsy. CAP measurements were available for 104 patients. The correlation of UDFF with MR-PDFF and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of UDFF for steatosis were calculated and compared with CAP. Factors influencing UDFF measurements were evaluated through multivariate analysis. UDFF demonstrated a moderate to strong correlation with MRI-PDFF (r = 0.60 [0.46; 0.71], p < 0.001) and a moderate correlation with liver biopsy (η = 0.31). The AUCs for UDFF in diagnosing steatosis (≥ grade 1) were 0.79 (MRI-PDFF reference) and 0.82 (biopsy reference), outperforming CAP for moderate (grade 2) steatosis (p = 0.043). UDFF consistently overestimated steatosis by 5% compared to MRI-PDFF. Parietal thickness > 30 mm was the only factor influencing measurement accuracy. UDFF had no measurement failures, unlike CAP, highlighting its robustness. Although the correlation between UDFF and MR-PDFF is moderate to strong, this prospective study does not provide results as good as those of the few previous studies evaluating the UDFF technique. These results highlight the importance of standardizing techniques and measurements in order to position US steatosis quantification tools in the management of patients with MASLD and MASH.",2025,Oct,Journal of clinical ultrasound : JCU,Alix Sidney; Marine Roux; Anita Paisant; Arthur Lecharpentier; Jérôme Boursier; Christophe Aubé,1940,True,2025-10-01
41087497,Effect and mechanism of fisetin against the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a prevalent liver disease that poses a serious health threat. Fisetin (FIS) is a flavonoid compound with multiple biological activities. The aim of this study was to investigate the potential therapeutic effect of FIS on MAFLD and the underlying mechanisms through in vivo and in vitro experiments. Our results demonstrated that FIS mitigated weight gain and improved blood glucose levels, blood lipid disorder and liver steatosis in mice with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MAFLD. RNA-seq analysis revealed that FIS affected the expression of many genes in the liver of MAFLD mice, including up-regulating the mRNA expression of Glut4 and GPx3 and down-regulating the mRNA expression of IL-1β and Cxcl10 genes. Moreover, FIS reduced sodium oleate-induced lipid accumulation, activated the GSK-3β/Nrf2/HO-1 signaling pathway, and inhibited the expression of PEPCK and G6PC in HepG2 cells. Overall, these findings demonstrate that FIS can alleviate MAFLD by enhancing the antioxidant capacity and reducing the gluconeogenic capacity in the liver, supporting FIS as a potential therapeutic against MAFLD.",2025,Oct,Scientific reports,Xin Peng; Zhiheng Wei; Shihao Liu; Luojie Liu; Honglin Jiang; Lisha Yu; Xiaodan Xu; Zhiliang Gu,1164,True,2025-10-01

The PubMed, Embase and Cochrane Library databases were searched up to March 2024 to identify randomized controlled trials that assessed the efficacy of GLP-1RAs compared with placebo. To further explore the long-term trajectories of GLP-1RAs, we also conducted subgroup analyses of the placebo-subtracted groups based on the follow-up periods: 12-18 weeks, 24-30 weeks, 48-56 weeks, 68-78 weeks and ≥ 104 weeks. Fifty-five trials involving 18,876 participants were included in this meta-analysis. GLP-1RAs significantly improved HbA1c levels, body weight, fasting plasma glucose (FPG), systolic blood pressure, and serum lipid levels. GLP-1RAs continuously reduced HbA1c and FPG for at least 104 weeks, with the largest reductions observed at 12-18 weeks (versus placebo, WMD -0.99 [-1.09, -0.89], P < 0.001; -1.56 [-1.82. -1.29], P < 0.001, respectively). However, the reductions in HbA1c and FPG at ≥ 104 weeks were approximately 0.36% and 0.47 mmol/L less than the reductions at 12-18 weeks, respectively. With respect to weight loss, the optimal effect was observed at 24-30 weeks (WMD -2.42 [-2.90, -1.95], P < 0.001), followed by a plateau period. In addition, GLP-1RAs were associated with a greater risk of hypoglycemia and gastrointestinal adverse events. GLP-1RAs are recommended for long-term treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes due to the persistent improvement in glycemic control and weight loss.

41126241,"Assessing greenhouse gas emissions in a primary care subdistrict in Cederberg, South Africa.","Climate change poses a significant threat to global health, risking decades of progress in public health gains and threatening the ability of developing countries to achieve universal health care goals. In response, healthcare systems worldwide are beginning to assess and mitigate their environmental impacts, ideally alongside building their resilience to climate change. Most of this work has centred on high-emitting health systems in high-income countries, yet a large number of developing countries are also committed to reducing the environmental impact of health care and in doing so pursuing a clean development trajectory. This study evaluates the emissions of a primary healthcare network in the Cederberg subdistrict, South Africa, using a standardized greenhouse gas accounting tool. The findings aim to inform mitigation strategies for Cederberg and may offer insights to other resource-constrained settings. A hybrid approach, combining bottom-up and top-down calculations, was employed to quantify greenhouse gas emissions across Scopes 1, 2, and 3 of the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, using the Healthcare Without Harm Climate Impact Check-up Tool. Key operational areas included energy use, transportation, waste management, procurement, and water use. Activity data were collected for 2023 through an iterative process of reviewing facility records, interviewing staff, and direct observations involving facility visits. The emissions for the Cederberg primary care subdistrict, including six clinics (two large and four small) totalled 1,228 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO₂e) per annum, which equates to 10.5 kg CO₂e per consultation. Of these emissions, 51% were generated by the extra supply chain (mainly pharmaceuticals and medical instruments and equipment), inhalers (34%), purchased electricity (8%), transportation - employee commuting (4%), stationary combustion (1%), mobile combustion (1%), electricity transmission and distribution losses (0.5%) and waste incineration (0.5%). This study provides the first published GHG emissions assessment for primary care in South Africa. The findings emphasize the importance of reducing emissions while maintaining essential services and advancing universal health coverage, with decarbonization offering potential environmental, economic, health, and social co-benefits.

This review discusses the interlinked roles of lifestyle, metabolic dysregulation, insulin resistance, neuroendocrine impairment, genetic predisposition, and post-translational modifications (PTMs) in PCOS pathogenesis. Lifestyle components, especially those leading to obesity and insulin resistance, worsen the hyperandrogenism, ovulatory dysfunction, and inflammation. Dietary treatments such as, DASH diet and caloric restriction, particularly along with metformin, have been proven to improve metabolic and reproductive parameters. Environmental toxins, such as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs) and advanced glycation end-products (AGEs), further compromise ovarian function and hormone regulation. Oxidative stress and insulin resistance, driven by mitochondrial malfunction and chronic inflammation, create a self-perpetuating vicious cycle that compromises oocyte quality and worsens metabolic imbalance. Neuroendocrine disruption, characterized by increased GnRH and LH pulsatility, is initiated by dysregulated kisspeptin, dynorphin, and neurokinin B signaling in KNDy neurons, modified GABAergic input, and increased AMH and androgens. PTMs such as phosphorylation, methylation, acetylation, and ubiquitination also play essential roles in granulosa cell function, AR signaling, insulin sensitivity, and oocyte maturation. Current and novel treatment options vary from lifestyle modifications and pharmacological interventions (e.g., metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, myoinositol, vitamin D, and statins) to regenerative measures like mesenchymal stem cells and fecal microbiota transplantation. Newer therapies focusing on PTMs and neuroendocrine regulators remain the future hope.

However, current evidence remains inconclusive. This meta-analysis aims to provide an updated evaluation of the impact of a carbohydrate-last (CL) strategy, compared to carbohydrate-first or unordered (CF) intake, on metabolic parameters in adults with T2D. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Central for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating nutrient intake order in T2D. Outcomes were analyzed using mean difference (MD) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) under a random-effects model. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane's Q test and I² statistics. Analyses were conducted using R, version 4.4.2. Seventeen studies involving 389 participants were included, with 114 (29%) in a parallel design and 192 (49%) in a crossover design receiving CL. In the pooled analysis, the CL group had significantly lower postprandial glucose at 60 min (MD: -42.73 mg/dL; 95% CI: -55.51, -29.96; p < 0.01) and 120 min (MD: -13.00 mg/dL; 95% CI: -21.07, -4.94; p < 0.01), higher postprandial glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels (MD: 8.21 pmol/L; 95% CI: 2.34, 14.09; p < 0.01), delayed gastric emptying half-time (MD: 28.14 min; 95% CI: 16.06, 40.23; p < 0.01), and reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) at follow-up (MD: -0.16%; 95% CI: -0.31, -0.01; p = 0.04).

Consequently, the metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) therapeutic pipeline is expanding rapidly and in multiple directions. In parallel, noninvasive tools for diagnosing and monitoring responses to therapeutic interventions are being studied, and clinically feasible findings are being explored as primary outcomes in interventional trials. The realization that distinct subgroups exist under the umbrella of SLD should guide more precise and personalized treatment recommendations and facilitate advancements in pharmacotherapeutics. This review summarizes recent updates of pathophysiology-based nomenclature and outlines both effective pharmacotherapeutics and those in the pipeline for MASLD/MASH, detailing their mode of action and the current status of phase 2 and 3 clinical trials. Of the extensive arsenal of pharmacotherapeutics in the MASLD/MASH pipeline, several have been rejected, whereas other, mainly monotherapy options, have shown only marginal benefits and are now being tested as part of combination therapies, yet others are still in development as monotherapies. Although the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently approved resmetirom, additional therapeutic approaches in development will ideally target MASH and fibrosis while improving cardiometabolic risk factors. Due to the urgent need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies and the potential availability of safety and tolerability data, repurposing existing and approved drugs is an appealing option. Finally, it is essential to highlight that SLD and, by extension, MASLD should be recognized and approached as a systemic disease affecting multiple organs, with the vigorous implementation of interdisciplinary and coordinated action plans.

41154632,GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Heart Failure.,"Heart failure (HF) is a growing public health concern, driven by the increasing prevalence of obesity, diabetes, and aging. Despite therapeutic advances, HF continues to be associated with high morbidity and mortality. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), originally developed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated cardiovascular benefits in clinical trials. Recent studies, including STEP-HFpEF and SUMMIT, have shown improvement in symptoms and weight loss in patients with HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). GLP-1 RAs are involved in multiple biological pathways relevant to heart failure pathophysiology. These include pathways related to sympathetic nervous system activity, inflammatory cytokine signaling, oxidative stress, calcium handling, natriuretic peptide signaling, and cardiac metabolism. GLP-1 receptor agonists modulate vascular pathways involving nitric oxide signaling, endothelial function, and renal sodium handling, contributing to improved hemodynamics and neurohormonal balance. Together, these actions intersect with key neurohormonal and cellular processes contributing to chronic heart failure progression. This review explores the mechanistic overlap between GLP-1 receptor signaling and heart failure pathophysiology. This mechanistic overlap suggests a plausible role for these agents as adjunctive treatments in heart failure, especially in metabolically driven phenotypes. While direct cardiac effects remain incompletely defined, systemic metabolic and anti-inflammatory actions provide a mechanistic basis for observed clinical benefits.",2025,Oct,Biomolecules,Ali Reza Rahmani; Simrat Kaur Dhaliwal; Paola Pastena; Eliot Kazakov; Keerthana Jayaseelan; Andreas Kalogeropoulos,1621,True,2025-10-01

A large amount of medical data is collected to diagnose the NASH where the majority of them are redundant. This paper initially focuses on selecting the most informative blood test data among the collected big data with the Pearson correlation statistical approach and modified Particle Swarm Optimization with Artificial Neural Networks (PSO-ANN) machine learning algorithm. Then, a gradient based Batch Least Squares (BLS) and a search-based Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) machine learning algorithms are implemented to optimize the NASH prediction models. Confirmed operational NASH diagnosis supervise the statistical and machine learning algorithms to develop accurate prediction models. Two machine learning algorithms were trained and also validated with the varying number of selected input features. The results yielded that the trained BLS machine learning model is able to diagnose benign and malignant cases with 100% and 98% accuracies, respectively. The trained ABC machine learning algorithm diagnoses the benign and malignant cases with 90.5% and 94.3% accuracies, respectively.",2025,Oct,BMC bioinformatics,Onder Tutsoy; Huseyin Ali Ozturk; Hilmi Erdem Sumbul,1322,True,2025-10-01

However, the role of gut microbiome and its associated metabolites as regulators and/or modulators in MASLD remains understudied. We aimed to investigate the gut microbiome diversity and composition, its interaction with plasma metabolites, and MASLD risk using population-level data. We combined 16S rRNA sequencing of stool samples with a wide range of plasma metabolites measured by the Metabolon HD4 platform, and MASLD diagnosed by abdominal ultrasound in the Rotterdam Study cohort at baseline, between 2012 and 2014. We assessed the relationship of gut microbiome and metabolites with MASLD separately. Then, the metabolic profile as exposure was obtained through multivariate linear or logistic regression models for MASLD, liver fibrosis, alpha diversity, and MASLD-associated genera. Our gut microbiome analysis showed that alpha diversity was lower in MASLD individuals (Shannon:  This study indicates alterations in several plasma metabolites to be linked to gut microbiome in MASLD.

However, these processes remain insufficiently understood in regions such as the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean, Pacific Oceania, and Asia. These areas often face challenges including limited infrastructure, resource constraints, and sociocultural barriers, which complicate the identification and nurturing of emerging talent. This study employs a qualitative approach, drawing on insights from semi-structured interviews with a sample composed of the ten development officers from the International Tennis Federation (ITF) who are based in these regions. Reflective thematic analysis was used to identify four key factors: structures and systems, economic challenges, access, and support influencing the effectiveness of developmental systems. By examining the nuanced interactions between these factors, the study identifies key obstacles and facilitators within these regions. The findings offer practical recommendations to improve talent pathways and ensure a more equitable distribution of opportunities.

41155711,Hormonal Alterations in Individuals with Obesity After Metabolic Bariatric Surgery: A Narrative Review.,"The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is increasingly recognized as an important regulator of energy balance and metabolism, extending beyond its traditional digestive functions. This review synthesizes current research on how modifications to the GI tract, particularly those induced by metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS), influence hormonal and physiological processes involved in glucose regulation and appetite control. MBS procedures, such as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) and sleeve gastrectomy (SG), induce significant and sustained weight loss, but also elicit adaptive morphological and functional changes within the intestines. These alterations include intestinal hypertrophy, increased mucosal surface area, changes in nutrient transit time, and modifications in enzyme activity. Such changes enhance the secretion of key gut hormones, including glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY), which play vital roles in promoting insulin secretion, suppressing appetite, and improving blood glucose regulation. The benefits stem from the exposure of undigested nutrients to different intestinal segments, which stimulates enteroendocrine activity and positively influences systemic metabolism. These hormonal adaptations contribute significantly to the metabolic improvements observed post-surgery, independent of weight loss alone. Understanding how gut structural and functional changes drive hormonal responses provides valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the success of MBS. Moreover, elucidating these processes may facilitate the development of less invasive therapies that mimic the metabolic benefits of surgery. Ultimately, this research advances our understanding of gut-mediated regulation of energy and glucose homeostasis and holds promise for improving treatment strategies for obesity and related metabolic disorders.",2025,Sep,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",Ioanna A Anastasiou; Dimitris Kounatidis; Eleni Rebelos; Natalia G Vallianou; Anastasios Tentolouris; Nikolaos Tentolouris; Maria Dalamaga; Irene Karampela,1859,True,2025-09-01
41123302,Limitations of Guideline-Recommended Risk Stratification in Identifying MASLD Patients for Novel Drug Treatments.,"Current guidelines recommend FIB-4 and transient elastography for non-invasive risk stratification in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). These tests can predict the presence or absence of advanced fibrosis, but their accuracy for identifying significant fibrosis in MASLD patients eligible for novel drug treatments remains unclear. In a multicenter cohort of 458 biopsy-proven MASLD patients, we evaluated the suitability of FIB-4 for identifying MASLD with histologically significant fibrosis (≥ F2). In a subcohort of 291 patients, we further assessed the diagnostic performance of the guideline-based sequential use of FIB-4 and transient elastography. We demonstrate that the recommended risk stratification remains suboptimal for the identification of patients with significant fibrosis, resulting in remarkably high false-positive and false-negative rates for FIB-4 (43% and 26%, respectively). Consequently, guideline-based risk stratification may misclassify a significant proportion of patients, leading to inappropriate treatment decisions regarding novel MASLD therapies approved for F2/F3 fibrosis.",2025,Sep,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,Martin Franck; Katharina John; Monika Rau; Andreas Geier; Jan-Peter Sowa; Jörn M Schattenberg; Münevver Demir; Heiner Wedemeyer; Klaus Schulze-Osthoff; Heike Bantel,1143,True,2025-09-01
41116206,Interplay between gut microbiota and intestinal lipid metabolism:mechanisms and implications.,"The gut microbiota is an indispensable symbiotic entity within the human holobiont, serving as a critical regulator of host lipid metabolism homeostasis. Therefore, it has emerged as a central subject of research in the pathophysiology of metabolic disorders. This microbial consortium orchestrates key aspects of host lipid dynamics-including absorption, metabolism, and storage-through multifaceted mechanisms such as the enzymatic processing of dietary polysaccharides, the facilitation of long-chain fatty acid uptake by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs), and the bidirectional modulation of adipose tissue functionality. Mounting evidence underscores that gut microbiota-derived metabolites not only directly mediate canonical lipid metabolic pathways but also interface with host immune pathways, epigenetic machinery, and circadian regulatory systems, thereby establishing an intricate crosstalk that coordinates systemic metabolic outputs. Perturbations in microbial composition (dysbiosis) drive pathological disruptions to lipid homeostasis, serving as a pathogenic driver for conditions such as obesity, hyperlipidemia, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This review systematically examines the emerging mechanistic insights into the gut microbiota-mediated regulation of intestinal lipid metabolism, while it elucidates its translational implications for understanding metabolic disease pathogenesis and developing targeted therapies. 肠道微生物群作为人体中不可或缺的共生体系，是宿主脂质代谢稳态的关键调节因子，因此成为现代代谢性疾病病理生理机制研究的焦点。该微生物群落通过多维度机制协调宿主脂质动态平衡（吸收、代谢和储存），包括参与膳食多糖的酶促加工、肠上皮细胞长链脂肪酸摄取促进以及脂肪组织功能双向调节。越来越多研究表明，肠道微生物群衍生的代谢产物不仅能直接调控典型脂质代谢通路，而且通过与宿主免疫通路、表观遗传调控机制和生物钟系统的交互作用进而构建协调全身代谢的精密调控网络。肠道微生物群紊乱（生态失调）可破坏宿主脂质稳态，是肥胖、高脂血症和非酒精性脂肪肝等代谢性疾病的致病因素。本综述系统研究了肠道微生物群调控肠道脂质代谢的新机制，并阐明了其对理解代谢性疾病发病机制和开发靶向治疗的转化医学价值。.",2025,Sep,Journal of Zhejiang University.

Despite growing semaglutide use worldwide, evidence on the effectiveness of current preventive measures-such as residue-free diets-remains limited. We report a 61-year-old female with obesity and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who underwent elective coronary angiography. She had been using weekly semaglutide for weight loss, discontinued six days before the procedure, but did not disclose this during preoperative evaluation. Following institutional guidance, she adhered to a 24-h residue-free diet and 12-h fasting. A protocol breach led to omission of preoperative gastric ultrasound. During anesthesia induction, she experienced large-volume regurgitation requiring urgent airway management. Postoperative chest CT revealed aspiration-related inflammatory changes. She recovered uneventfully and later acknowledged omitting semaglutide use from her medical history because she did not consider it a ""medication."" This case demonstrates that even stricter dietary measures than those recommended in current guidelines may not eliminate aspiration risk in GLP-1-RA users.

Hybrid exercise training, integrating electrical muscle stimulation (EMS) with voluntary muscle contractions, offers a novel, low-impact therapeutic modality; however, its clinical efficacy remains underexplored. This randomized controlled trial investigated the clinical efficacy of hybrid exercise training in improving hepatic steatosis, liver enzyme profiles, systemic inflammation, and metabolic health in sedentary, obese, middle-aged women with NAFLD. Thirty women with ultrasound-confirmed grade 2-3 NAFLD were randomized to either six weeks of hybrid exercise training (n = 15) or lifestyle counseling (n = 15). Primary and secondary outcomes included liver steatosis grade, serum liver enzymes (AST, ALT), inflammatory marker IL-6, fasting blood glucose, and anthropometric parameters. Hybrid exercise training led to significant improvements compared with lifestyle counseling. Steatosis grade decreased markedly (- 0.80 vs. -0.02; p < 0.01; η² = 0.38), accompanied by large reductions in ALT (- 31.86 U/L; p < 0.01; η² = 0.65) and AST (- 27.46 U/L; p < 0.01; η² = 0.61). IL-6 concentrations declined (- 3.0 pg/mL; p < 0.05; η² = 0.42), while anthropometric outcomes improved (body weight - 4.51 kg, BMI - 1.56 kg/m², WHR - 0.042; all p < 0.01; η² ≥ 0.52). Correlation analyses showed that decreases in IL-6 were strongly associated with improvements in ALT (r = - 0.72, p < 0.01) and AST (r = - 0.68, p < 0.01). Hybrid exercise training is a safe, feasible, and clinically effective intervention for improving liver health and attenuating systemic inflammation in obese women with NAFLD, with strong associations between IL-6 reductions and liver enzyme improvements.

40620322,The expanding role of semaglutide: beyond glycemic control.,"Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), has transformed the treatment landscape for type 2 diabetes and obesity due to its robust efficacy and wide-ranging therapeutic benefits. This review outlines semaglutide's diverse mechanisms of action, including its roles in glucose homeostasis, weight reduction, and cardiovascular protection. Data from the SUSTAIN and PIONEER clinical trials demonstrate significant reductions in HbA1c, body weight, and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), firmly establishing semaglutide as a key agent in diabetes management. The STEP trials further highlight its exceptional effectiveness in weight control, with participants achieving up to 20% weight loss alongside improvements in obesity-related comorbidities. Moreover, ongoing studies such as the FOCUS trial are investigating its impact on microvascular complications. Beyond glycemic control, semaglutide exhibits renoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and potential hepatoprotective effects. Emerging evidence also supports its expanding role in the management of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), heart failure, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), alcohol use disorder (AUD), and Alzheimer's disease. While gastrointestinal side effects are the most commonly reported adverse events, long-term studies affirm its overall safety and tolerability. The availability of both subcutaneous and oral formulations further enhances treatment adherence and accessibility. As a result, semaglutide has emerged as a cornerstone therapy for a broad spectrum of metabolic, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine disorders.

40211469,Comparative efficacy and safety of pharmacologic therapies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease over 24 weeks in reducing liver steatosis and fibrosis: A network meta-analysis.,"Metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a prevalent chronic liver condition associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Effective pharmacological interventions targeting liver steatosis and fibrosis are essential to improving patient outcomes. This study aims to systematically compare the efficacy and safety of various pharmacologic therapies for MASLD over 24 weeks using a comprehensive network meta-analysis. A systematic review and network meta-analysis were conducted on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating pharmacologic treatments for MASLD. The primary outcomes were changes in liver steatosis (measured by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction) and fibrosis (measured by magnetic resonance elastography-derived liver stiffness measurement), with safety assessed through adverse events. A Bayesian framework was employed to integrate and compare data across treatments, generating rankings for efficacy and safety. A systematic search was conducted across databases, identifying 23 RCTs from 10 144 initial records. For steatosis reduction, resmetirom showed the most significant improvement (mean difference: -3.86, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -7.33 to -0.39) compared with placebo. In terms of fibrosis improvement, pegozafermin demonstrated the greatest effect (-4.85, 95% CI: -5.50 to -4.19). Most treatments showed acceptable safety profiles, with efruxifermin showing slightly higher adverse events (0.32, 95% CI: 0.06-0.70) compared with placebo. This comprehensive network meta-analysis demonstrates the varying efficacy of pharmacologic interventions for MASLD, with resmetirom and pegozafermin emerging as particularly promising treatments for steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. While most treatments exhibited favourable safety profiles, careful monitoring is warranted, particularly with efruxifermin due to its slightly elevated adverse event profile. These findings provide valuable evidence to guide clinical decision-making in MASLD management, though longer-term studies are needed to confirm the durability of these therapeutic effects and further establish safety profiles.",2025,Jun,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Jiaxin Zhong; Zixin Cai; Guanghui Zhu; Jingjing Zhang,2160,True,2025-06-01
41137108,Discovery of ultrasound-derived fat fraction as a non-invasive tool for MASLD diagnosis.,"This study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ultrasound-derived fat fraction (UDFF) for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), by directly comparing it with the non-invasive gold standard MRI-PDFF and the established ultrasound method CAP. The diagnostic criteria for MASLD were used, we included 103 individuals with 53 MASLD patients and 49 healthy controls. All participants underwent liver MRI for MRI-PDFF quantification; ultrasound elastography for UDFF measurement; and vibration-controlled transient elastography for CAP assessment. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the performance of UDFF and CAP for predicting MRI-PDFF ≥ 5%, the imaging threshold defining hepatic steatosis in MASLD diagnosis. Finally, we analyzed the correlation between UDFF and serological indicators and the consistency between UDFF and MRI-PDFF. Across all 103 participants, the median UDFF value was 6.0%, median CAP was 246 dB/m, and median MRI-PDFF was 5.44%. Overall, UDFF was positively correlated with MRI-PDFF (R = 0.876; P < 0.001), and CAP was positively correlated with MRI-PDFF (R = 0.792, P < 0.001). For diagnosing 5% and above MRI-PDFF, UDFF was noted to have a mean AUC of 0.981. Additionally, CAP was noted to have an AUC of 0.932 in diagnosing MASLD. In addition, the Bland-Altman difference plots showed overall UDFF and MRI-PDFF, with a mean deviation of -0.2%. A linear regression model between the difference and the mean suggested proportional error. Ultrasound testing for UDFF provides a simple and noninvasive clinical tool to quantify the extent of hepatic steatosis. The diagnostic efficacy of UDFF is superior to CAP. Notably, while UDFF shows strong agreement with MRI-PDFF overall, Bland-Altman analysis revealed a proportional bias, with UDFF tending to underestimate MRI-PDFF at higher fat content levels. Despite this limitation, UDFF demonstrates potential as a noninvasive alternative to MRI-PDFF for MASLD diagnosis.",2025,Oct,European journal of medical research,Huiru Jin; Mengfan Jiao; Chengxiao Yu; Tingting Ren; Qingling Chen; Zixing Dai; Erfu Xie; Longfeng Jiang; Yuwen Li,2018,True,2025-10-01

41129133,Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists and Age-Related Macular Degeneration.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are increasingly used for weight loss, but their ocular effects in nondiabetic individuals remain unclear. Prior studies suggest GLP-1RA use reduced age-related macular degeneration (AMD) risk in patients with diabetes, but applicability to nondiabetic populations is unknown. To evaluate the risk of developing nonexudative AMD and its progression to exudative AMD among patients with obesity but not diabetes prescribed GLP-1RAs compared with those prescribed other weight-loss drugs (OWLDs). This retrospective cohort study used electronic health record data obtained from the multicenter TriNetX Global Collaborative Network on patients aged 55 years or older diagnosed with overweight or obesity but not diabetes from January 2004 to July 2025. For the primary analysis, patients with preexisting nonexudative AMD were excluded. For the secondary analysis, patients with preexisting nonexudative AMD were included, while those with preexisting exudative AMD were excluded. Propensity score matching balanced baseline demographics and comorbidities. Data were analyzed on March 21, 2025, and August 2, 2025. Patients were prescribed either the GLP-1RAs liraglutide or semaglutide or OWLDs including lorcaserin, sibutramine, setmelanotide, fenfluramine, mazindol, orlistat, phentermine, and diethylpropion. The primary outcome was development of nonexudative AMD at 5, 7, and 10 years. The secondary outcome was progression to exudative AMD at 10 years. Risk ratios (RRs) with 95% CIs were calculated. Standardized mean differences were used to assess covariate balance after matching. A total of 91 408 patients were included. After propensity score matching for the primary analysis, 45 704 patients remained in each of the GLP-1RA and OWLD cohorts. The GLP-1RA cohort included 35 753 (78.2%) females and 7852 (17.2%) males with a mean (SD) age of 61.1 (5.76) years, while the OWLD cohort included 35 732 (78.2%) females and 7815 (17.1%) males with a mean [SD] age of 61.0 (5.86) years. Covariate balance was achieved across all variables for the GLP-1RA and OWLD cohorts in the primary analysis. GLP-1RA use was associated with reduced risk of nonexudative AMD compared with OWLDs at 5 years (RR, 0.16; 95% CI, 0.10-0.28; P < .001), 7 years (RR, 0.13; 95% CI, 0.08-0.22; P < .001), and 10 years (RR, 0.09; 95% CI, 0.05-0.16; P < .001). No differences were observed in progression to exudative AMD. In this cohort study, GLP-1RA use was associated with reduced risk of developing nonexudative AMD but was not associated with progression to exudative AMD among individuals with nonexudative AMD. These findings may inform future randomized trials evaluating the ocular effects of GLP-1RAs in nondiabetic populations.",2025,Oct,JAMA ophthalmology,Abhimanyu S Ahuja; Alfredo A Paredes; Benjamin K Young,2774,True,2025-10-01
41018564,Application of nutrition interventions with GLP-1 based therapies: A narrative review of the challenges and solutions.,"Obesity is a heterogeneous systemic chronic disease associated with excess adiposity and a complex etiology and is increasing in prevalence worldwide. Initially used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) based therapies are now widely prescribed for individuals with overweight and obesity as an adjunct to a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. However, despite their impressive weight reduction capabilities, many patients on GLP-1 based therapies do not receive appropriate nutrition advice and struggle to maintain their weight reduction. This narrative review explores and summarizes existing literature on the challenges associated with nutrition intake in people with obesity taking GLP-1 based therapies and practical applications of nutrition and lifestyle interventions for the management of these individuals to ensure their best long-term health outcomes. Delivering optimal nutrition management to people with obesity treated with GLP-1 based therapies presents healthcare providers with many challenges including addressing the impact of obesity and weight reduction on body composition (particularly muscle mass loss and risk of sarcopenic obesity), and poor nutrition. Physicians should work with dietitians and other healthcare providers to deliver comprehensive lifestyle counselling that is patient-centered, aligning with the needs and preferences of the individual. This should include advice on: timely and appropriate nutrition that centers on adequate macronutrient, micronutrient and fluid intake, particularly increased protein intake alongside resistance training for the preservation of muscle mass; mental health; sleep hygiene, physical activity; and medication adherence and persistence. Evidence-based nutrition guidelines can also provide an important framework for healthcare professionals, helping to ensure nutrition advice is consistent and based on rigorous scientific research. Our findings underscore the importance of ensuring that patients treated with GLP-1 based therapies are closely monitored and provided with comprehensive nutrition and lifestyle support to ensure they achieve the best long-term health outcomes.",2025,Dec,Obesity pillars,Angela Fitch; Linda Gigliotti; Harold Edward Bays,2208,True,2025-12-01
41040428,Association between eating behavior patterns and the therapeutic efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a multicenter prospective observational study.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are widely used to improve glycemic control and induce weight loss in individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D), yet treatment responses vary significantly among individuals. Eating behavior has been hypothesized to influence therapeutic efficacy, but supporting evidence remains limited. In this multicenter, prospective observational study, we enrolled 92 individuals with T2D initiating GLP-1RA therapy (liraglutide, dulaglutide, oral semaglutide, or injectable semaglutide) at four institutions in Gifu Prefecture, Japan. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 12 months for clinical parameters, dietary intake, and eating behaviors using validated tools (Food Frequency Questionnaire and the Japanese version of the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire [DEBQ-J]). Primary and secondary outcomes included changes in HbA1c, body weight, and eating behavior patterns over 12 months. GLP-1RA therapy significantly reduced HbA1c, body weight, and body fat percentage at 12 months. Notably, external eating scores showed a sustained decrease, while emotional and restrained eating scores exhibited transient changes. Higher baseline external eating scores were independently associated with greater weight reduction and showed a trend toward enhanced glycemic improvement. No significant associations were observed between emotional or restrained eating scores and clinical outcomes. This study demonstrates that GLP-1RAs improve both metabolic parameters and external eating behavior in T2D individuals. External eating emerged as a potential behavioral marker predictive of treatment response. These findings suggest that integrating eating behavior assessments may help personalize GLP-1RA therapy and optimize outcomes in clinical practice.

41135142,Tirzepatide for sleep-disordered breathing in SURMOUNT-OSA: Time course and association with body weight.,"Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a common disorder with major cardiometabolic and neurocognitive sequelae. It affects up to 1 billion people globally and is frequently attributable to excess weight [1]. Tirzepatide is a once-weekly, dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist that is FDA-approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe OSA in adults with obesity. The SURMOUNT-OSA program included two 52-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase 3 studies (Study 1 and Study 2). The objective of these analyses was to assess time to treatment effects for improvements in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and sleep apnea-specific hypoxic burden (SASHB), and how these changes correspond with body weight reduction. We also aimed to investigate weight-dependent and weight-independent effects of tirzepatide treatment for OSA using linear regression analysis. The results of peripheral AHI (pAHI) and SASHB measurements from WatchPAT 300 in Study 1 were consistent with the polysomnographic (PSG) findings. The tirzepatide-associated improvements in pAHI were significant vs baseline as early as Week 4. However, the estimated treatment difference compared to placebo was not significant until Week 20 for both pAHI and WatchPAT-based SASHB. The magnitude of changes in AHI and SASHB were associated with achieved weight reduction in both studies. The results from these post hoc analyses provide details regarding the time course of resolution and insights regarding the impact of weight reduction on OSA improvements. Additional research is needed to determine the impact of body weight reduction versus other effects of tirzepatide on the improvements in OSA measures.

41094544,The role of insulin resistance in the longitudinal progression from NAFLD to cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic disease.,"This study aimed to elucidate the role of insulin resistance in the progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) to cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) diseases, and to explore the potential influence of lifestyle factors. This study included participants free of NAFLD and CKM diseases from the UK Biobank. Insulin resistance was assessed using the TyG index. CKM diseases include ischemic stroke (IS), ischemic heart disease (IHD), type 2 diabetes (T2D), and chronic kidney disease (CKD). Markov multi-state models were used to assess the associations between the TyG index and disease transitions. Among 377,757 participants (median age 57 years), 4949 developed NAFLD over a median follow-up of 13.6 years. Of these, 12.65% progressed to T2D, 9.11% to IHD, 8.63% to CKD, and 4.61% to IS. Elevated TyG levels significantly accelerated transitions from NAFLD to first-onset CKM disease (HR = 1.25, 95% CI 1.05-1.49), double CKM disease (HR = 1.46, 95% CI 1.19-1.80), and triple CKM disease (HR = 1.81, 95% CI 1.28-2.55). Similar progression risk increases were observed for individual CKM components: T2D (HR = 1.41, 95% CI 1.11-1.78), CKD (HR = 1.37, 95% CI 1.08-1.75), and IS (HR = 1.70, 95% CI 1.27-2.27). A J-shaped dose-response relationship was identified. Transitions risk remained pronounced among individuals with healthy sleep and regular physical activity. Insulin resistance independently accelerated the progression from NAFLD to CKM diseases, particularly ischemic stroke. Healthy sleep and regular physical activity failed to offset this detrimental impact.",2025,Oct,Cardiovascular diabetology,Chao Hou; Xiangling Yuan; Min Peng; Xuan Shi; Dahong Yang; Fang Wang; Ke Song; Gelin Xu; Jianzhong Shi,1591,True,2025-10-01
39103998,Precision medicine and nucleotide-based therapeutics to treat steatotic liver disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a complex multifactorial disease and becoming the leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. MASLD spans from isolated steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), that may progress to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Genetic, metabolic, and environmental factors strongly contribute to the heterogeneity of MASLD. Lifestyle intervention and weight loss represent a viable treatment for MASLD. Moreover, Resmetirom, a thyroid hormone beta receptor agonist, has recently been approved for MASLD treatment. However, most individuals treated did not respond to this therapeutic, suggesting the need for a more tailored approach to treat MASLD. Oligonucleotide-based therapies, namely small-interfering RNA (siRNA) and antisense oligonucleotide (ASO), have been recently developed to tackle MASLD by reducing the expression of genes influencing MASH progression, such as PNPLA3 and HSD17B13. Here, we review the latest progress made in the synthesis and development of oligonucleotide-based agents targeting genetic determinants of MASH.",2025,Feb,Clinical and molecular hepatology,Andrea Caddeo; Stefano Romeo,1153,True,2025-02-01

CSPH may be assessed with the Baveno VII criteria with lower performance in patients with obesity (body mass index ≥30 kg/m Systematic review of studies validating Baveno VII criteria of CSPH (hepatic venous pressure gradient as reference) with search strategy of ""CSPH"" (AND) ""Baveno VII"", from Baveno VII consensus until June 2024. A meta-analysis of Baveno VII criteria (ruling in: LSM (liver stiffness measurement) ≥25 kPa and ruling out: LSM ≤15 kPa + platelets ≥150x10 Five studies with 1433 cACLD patients (CSPH 34% to 62%) of different etiologies were identified. LSM ≥25 kPa had an excellent PPV (92%) pooled by studies and etiologies, except MASLD with obesity. A ≥75% risk of CSPH by the ANTICIPATE±NASH models improved PPV to 95%, including MASLD with obesity (PPV 0.67 to 0.83; p<0.001). The pooled NPV for ruling out was 99% for all etiologies. ANTICIPATE±NASH showed an excellent performance across centers. Baveno VII criteria for CSPH adequately classify patients across etiologies, except MASLD with obesity. Using a ≥75% risk threshold by ANTICIPATE models to detect CSPH improves global performance, including MASLD with obesity, supporting it can be a simpler way of predicting CSPH in clinical practice. This systematic review and meta-analysis confirm the validity for ruling out and ruling in CSPH in cACLD patients with the Baveno VII criteria. Using a threshold of ≥75% of the ANTICIPATE±NASH models, the global performance for detecting CSPH improves regardless of etiology.

40873114,Development of NAFLD-Specific Human Liver Organoid Models on a Microengineered Array Chip for Semaglutide Efficacy Evaluation.,"Progressive non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) may culminate in severe complications, including fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma, yet therapeutic breakthroughs remain elusive, necessitating novel pharmacological strategies. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist clinically approved for type 2 diabetes and obesity management, has demonstrated pleiotropic effects in preclinical NAFLD models. In this study, we investigated semaglutide's therapeutic efficacy and mechanisms in a human liver organoids (hLOs) model of NAFLD. Utilising microengineered array chips, human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) were differentiated into hLOs with functional hepatic properties. NAFLD pathology was induced via free fatty acid (FFA) exposure, recapitulating disease hallmarks such as steatosis, inflammatory cytokine elevation and fibrogenic activation. Semaglutide treatment at 50 nM significantly attenuated lipid deposition caused by FFAs and reduced triglyceride levels by 8-fold and cholesterol levels by 1.8-fold. It also inhibited the expression of pro-inflammatory markers (IL-6, IL-8, TNF-α) by about 1.5-2 fold and increased the level of lipolytic genes by about 45%. These findings elucidate the therapeutic potential of semaglutide in attenuating key NAFLD-associated pathologies and establish a robust in vitro platform for preclinical drug evaluation. The study provides critical insights into targeted NAFLD interventions and supports the translation of GLP-1-based therapies into clinical practice, addressing an unmet need in hepatology.",2025,Aug,Cell proliferation,Xiao-Yan You; Xiang-Yang Li; Hui Wang; Guo-Ping Zhao,1599,True,2025-08-01
39504308,Design and Synthesis of Dual Galectin-3 and EGFR Inhibitors Against Liver Fibrosis.,"Liver fibrosis, mainly arising from chronic viral or metabolic liver diseases, is a significant global health concern. There is currently only one FDA-approved drug (Resmetirom) in the market to combat liver fibrosis. Both galectin-3 and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) play important roles in liver fibrosis, while galectin-3 may interact with EGFR. Galectin-3 inhibitors, typically lactose or galactose derivatives may inhibit liver fibrosis. We hypothesized that targeting both galectin-3 and EGFR may have better effect against liver fibrosis. Here, EGFR inhibitor erlotinib was used in a series of designed galectin-3 inhibitors after hybridization with the pharmacophore structure in reported galectin-3 inhibitors to impede hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) activation by a typical method of click chemistry.

41121200,"The nomenclature of fatty liver disease and its impact on obesity traits, insulin resistance, and hepatic fibrosis.","Definitions of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), metabolic dysfunction-associated FLD (MAFLD), and steatotic liver disease (SLD) have been proposed to better guide clinical practice and epidemiological studies. The effects of the nomenclature on the incidence of FLD and its associations with obesity phenotypes, insulin resistance (IR), and liver fibrosis were examined in this study. NAFLD, MAFLD, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) were diagnosed on the basis of ultrasound examination and metabolic disorders among 6,718 community-dwelling individuals from southeast China. Six obesity phenotypes, seven IR surrogates, and the NAFLD Fibrosis Score (NFS) were applied to evaluate their association with FLDs through multivariable logistic regression models, restricted cubic splines, and receiver operating characteristic curves. The prevalence of FLD, NAFLD, MAFLD, and MASLD was 35.47%, 33.34%, 34.77%, and 32.79%, respectively. The associations of obesity-FLD, IR-FLD, and FLD-NFS were statistically significant across all the FLD definitions. Patients with MAFLD demonstrated slightly higher odds ratios (ORs) than those with FLD, NAFLD, and MASLD. However, alcoholic-FLD (AFLD), which is included in the MAFLD nomenclature, showed lower ORs with obesity and IR and lower NFS, significantly differently from other FLDs. Among all obesity and IR indices, triglyceride and glucose index body mass index (TyG-BMI), the TyG-waist height ratio (TyG-WHtR), and the TyG-waist circumstance (TyG-WC) were the best at predicting FLDs and ORs with respect to NFS. The nomenclature of MAFLD covers a wider range of FLD than NAFLD and MASLD do, but the heterogeneity of AFLD is nonnegligible. Compared with MASLD, NAFLD remains a practical and efficient definition for large-scale population screening, especially in resource-limited settings. TyG-BMI, TyG-WHtR, and TyG-WC could better predict FLD and associated fibrosis, affirming their potential as simple and cost-effective tools to support health monitoring and early intervention.",2025,Oct,Lipids in health and disease,Liangguang Xiang; Xiaoyun Li; Jiamin Gong; Long He; Wanxin Li; Jun Chen; Ruimei Feng; Shanshan Du; Weimin Ye,2074,True,2025-10-01

However, implication of endogenous gut hormones in weight loss (WL) after surgery remains unclear. Our study aimed at objectifying the role of gut hormones in postoperative WL in 32 women with obesity who underwent vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG). Post-meal tests were realized to measure plasma gut hormones (GLP-1, PYY and ghrelin), before and 6 months after VSG. Area under the curve and peak/basis ratios (T30/T0) were analyzed for each hormone in relation to percentage WL (%WL) and caloric intake decrease (%CID) evaluated at 6, 12, 36 months after surgery. Fasting GLP-1 and PYY secretions were not altered by surgery but their postprandial peaks were significantly elevated. Fasting and postprandial Ghrelin secretions were drastically reduced. Preoperative ghrelin was negatively correlated with 6 months %CID. Preoperative peak/basis ratio of PYY and GLP-1 were both negatively correlated with postoperative %WL at 36 months (P < 0,01 and P < 0,05). Post/preoperative peak ratios of PYY secretion were positively correlated to %WL from 6 months to 36 months after VSG (P < 0,05). Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses show that preoperative peak/basis PYY or GLP-1 and post/preoperative peak ratios of PYY were able to predict long-term efficiency of VSG defined as %WL ≥ 30 % at 36 months. Preoperative postprandial secretion of PYY and its ability to increase early after surgery is predictive of long-term WL after VSG.

While several anti-diabetic agents show promise, a comprehensive analysis comparing their efficacy on biopsy-confirmed histological outcomes, including dose-dependent effects and the mediating role of weight loss, remains unexplored. A frequentist random-effects network meta-analysis (NMA) was conducted to explore histological efficacy of anti-diabetic agents in biopsy-confirmed MASH without cirrhosis. The primary outcome was fibrosis improvement (≥1 stage) without worsening steatohepatitis; the secondary outcome was MASH resolution without fibrosis worsening. Incretin-based agents were dose-stratified. Treatment ranking used surface-under the cumulative-ranking curve (SUCRA). Meta-regression investigated the impact of percentage weight loss and baseline covariates on the proportion of individuals achieving histological end-points.

41109401,Liraglutide promotes diabetic corneal epithelial and nerve regeneration by suppressing oxidative stress via the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway.,"Although clinical evidence suggested that glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists exhibit neuroprotective properties in patients with diabetic peripheral neuropathy, their therapeutic potential in diabetic keratopathy (DK) remains unexplored. This study investigates the neuroprotective and wound-healing effects of liraglutide in DK through PI3K/AKT pathway activation and oxidative stress amelioration. In vitro, we evaluated the effects of liraglutide on migration, oxidative stress, and apoptosis in human corneal epithelial cells (HCECs). Axonal outgrowth was quantified in the primary trigeminal ganglion neurons cultured under high glucose conditions. The role of the PI3K/AKT pathway was confirmed using specific pharmacological inhibitors. In vivo, diabetic mice were treated with liraglutide, and clinical outcomes (corneal fluorescein scores, tear production, sensitivity, goblet cell density) were measured. Corneal tissues were analysed for PI3K/AKT activation, wound healing, and nerve regeneration. Additional experiments using PI3K inhibitors were performed to confirm the pathway's involvement. Our in vitro experiments demonstrated that liraglutide promoted HCECs migration, reduced oxidative stress, and inhibited apoptosis via activation of the PI3K/AKT pathway. Additionally, liraglutide enhanced axonal outgrowth in high glucose-treated primary trigeminal ganglion neurons through the same mechanism. In vivo, liraglutide treatment significantly improved clinical outcomes in diabetic mice, including reduced corneal fluorescein staining, increased tear production, improved corneal sensitivity, and restoration of conjunctival goblet cell density. Mechanistically, liraglutide activated PI3K/AKT signalling in the diabetic cornea, promoting wound healing and nerve regeneration by mitigating oxidative stress. These beneficial effects were abolished upon PI3K pathway inhibition. These findings provide strong preclinical evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of liraglutide for the treatment of DK.",2025,Oct,European journal of pharmacology,Wentao Han; Shirui Dai; Xinyue Sun; Shaohua Liu; Liwei Zhang; Baihua Chen,2041,True,2025-10-01

Although MASLD is associated with obesity and insulin resistance, it is increasingly recognized that the liver engages in complex crosstalk with several endocrine pathways, including thyroid function, sex and steroid hormone regulation, and growth hormone signaling. The pathophysiology of MASLD is multifactorial and complex, as reflected by its clinical range-from simple steatosis to cirrhosis. MASLD now affects about one-quarter of the global population, with its prevalence rising due to sedentary lifestyles, chronic caloric excess, and endocrine disturbances contributing to disease progression. Given the escalating prevalence of MASLD and its frequent concurrence with various endocrinopathies, understanding this relationship is critical for refining diagnostic accuracy and optimizing therapeutic strategies. This review aims to synthesize contemporary insights into the complex interactions between MASLD and selected endocrine disorders, elucidate underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, and underscore novel treatment paradigms.

Pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA) is the gold standard treatment, but the extent of small vessel remodeling, which strongly influences treatment outcomes, remains difficult to quantify pre-operatively. We developed a multiscale, structure-based model of the pulmonary circulation using patient-specific vascular geometries from CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) and haemodynamic data from right heart catheterization (RHC). Eleven CTEPH patients were included. The model estimated individual remodeling burden by fitting simulated to measured preoperative mean pulmonary artery pressure (mPAP). PEA was simulated by removing flow obstructions to predict Postoperative mPAP and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), both under pre- and post-PEA boundary conditions.

Outcomes included weight loss efficacy, safety, and change in waitlist status at 1 year. Patients achieved a mean total body weight loss of 7.8% (SD 6.1). Of patients who were ineligible for transplant due to elevated body mass index, 48.2% achieved waitlist activation after successful weight loss. Treatment-limiting gastrointestinal side effects occurred in 16.7% of patients. Patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD, 30.8%) versus hemodialysis (8.7%) discontinued therapy more frequently. In a single-center cohort, patients who received semaglutide experienced significantly greater weight loss and increased rates of waitlist activation compared with a lifestyle-only intervention. Semaglutide was generally well-tolerated. Prospective studies should examine whether patients on PD experience severe GI side effects more frequently on semaglutide.",2025,Oct,Clinical transplantation,Francis G Wade; Krista L Lentine; David Turk; Kyleigh Kirbach; Taylor Knobloch; Mark Schnitzler; Kamran Qureshi; Wing-Kin Syn; Vidya A Fleetwood,1430,True,2025-10-01

40050362,Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in adults.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the umbrella term that comprises metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver, or isolated hepatic steatosis, through to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, the progressive necroinflammatory disease form that can progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. MASLD is estimated to affect more than one-third of adults worldwide. MASLD is closely associated with insulin resistance, obesity, gut microbial dysbiosis and genetic risk factors. The obesity epidemic and the growing prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus greatly contribute to the increasing burden of MASLD. The treatment and prevention of major metabolic comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity will probably slow the growth of MASLD. In 2023, the field decided on a new nomenclature and agreed on a set of research and action priorities, and in 2024, the US FDA approved the first drug, resmetirom, for the treatment of non-cirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with moderate to advanced fibrosis. Reliable, validated biomarkers that can replace histology for patient selection and primary end points in MASH trials will greatly accelerate the drug development process. Additionally, noninvasive tests that can reliably determine treatment response or predict response to therapy are warranted. Sustained efforts are required to combat the burden of MASLD by tackling metabolic risk factors, improving risk stratification and linkage to care, and increasing access to therapeutic agents and non-pharmaceutical interventions.",2025,Mar,Nature reviews.

41155523,Molecular Biomarkers and Therapeutic Approach of Patients with Diabetes and Obstructive Sleep Apnea.,"The bidirectional relationship between obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) represents a critical intersection in metabolic medicine. Therefore, the present review examines the most recent data regarding molecular mechanisms linking OSA and T2DM, analyzing key biomarkers including hypoxia-inducible factors (HIF 1α), inflammatory mediators, adipokines, microRNAs, hormones, and neuropeptides that serve as both diagnostic indicators and potential therapeutic targets. Key molecular findings from the scientific literature report elevated HIF-1α promoting insulin resistance, decreased SIRT1 levels, dysregulated microRNA-181a and microRNA-199a, increased inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, CRP), and altered adipokine profiles with reduced adiponectin and elevated leptin and resistin. Current clinical evidence reveals significant therapeutic potential for modern antidiabetic medications in the management of OSA. GLP-1 receptor agonists, particularly tirzepatide, received FDA approval as the first medication for moderate-to-severe OSA in obese adults, showing a 55-63% AHI reduction. SGLT2 inhibitors also demonstrate promising results through weight loss and cardiovascular protection mechanisms. This integrated approach represents the evolution toward comprehensive OSA management beyond traditional mechanical ventilation strategies. Future research should focus on developing personalized treatment algorithms based on individual molecular biomarker profiles, investigating combination therapies, and exploring novel targets, including chronotherapy agents.",2025,Oct,International journal of molecular sciences,Viviana Elian; Violeta Popovici; Alexandru Tudor Steriade; Gabriela Radulian; Emma Adriana Ozon; Elena Moroșan; Madalina Musat,1600,True,2025-10-01
41077164,The role of glycolysis in MASLD development: Pathogenesis and therapeutic strategies.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), as the hepatic manifestation of metabolic syndrome, is characterized by hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Accumulating evidence suggests that metabolic reprogramming, particularly enhanced glycolysis, plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MASLD. Dysregulated glycolysis not only supplies energy and biosynthetic precursors for multiple hepatic cell types but also directly contributes to lipid accumulation, inflammatory activation, fibrogenesis, and even hepatocellular carcinogenesis. This review summarizes the mechanisms underlying glycolytic reprogramming in MASLD and examines the distinct roles of glycolytic alterations in various cell types, including hepatocytes, macrophages, hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), T cells, and bile duct epithelial cells (BECs). Furthermore, glycolysis mediates the crosstalk between different cell types and organ types in MASLD, modulating cytokine production and activating pro-inflammatory and pro-fibrotic signaling pathways. Finally, this article discusses the potential and challenges of targeting key glycolytic enzymes - such as hexokinase 2 (HK2), 6-phosphofructo-2-kinase/fructose-2, 6-bisphosphatase (PFKFB3) and Pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) - as therapeutic strategies, offering new perspectives for alleviating the disease burden of MASLD.",2025,Oct,Pharmacological research,Yidan Shang; Qinmei Sun; Xin Xin; Zhuoyuan Wang; Siting Gao; Rutao Lin; Yiyang Hu; Xiaoning Wang; Qin Feng,1376,True,2025-10-01

MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 was a 52-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial evaluating the safety of resmetirom in adults with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and presumed NASH. Patients were randomized to three double-blind arms (100 mg resmetirom (n = 325), 80 mg resmetirom (n = 327) or placebo (n = 320)) or open-label 100 mg resmetirom (n = 171). The primary end point was incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) over 52 weeks and key secondary end points were LDL-C, apoB, triglycerides (over 24 weeks), hepatic fat (over 16 and 52 weeks) and liver stiffness (over 52 weeks). Resmetirom was safe and well tolerated. TEAEs occurred in 86.5% (open-label 100 mg resmetirom), 86.1% (100 mg resmetirom), 88.4% (80 mg resmetirom) and 81.8% (placebo) of patients. TEAEs in excess of placebo included diarrhea and nausea at the initiation of treatment. Key secondary end points included least square means difference from placebo at 80 mg, 100 mg resmetirom: LDL-C (-11.1%, -12.6%), apoB (-15.6%, -18.0%), triglycerides (-15.4%, -20.4%), 16-week hepatic fat (-34.9%, -38.6%), (P < 0.0001) and liver stiffness (-1.02, -1.70) and 52-week hepatic fat (-28.8, -33.9).

The circadian rhythm, as a fundamental regulatory system, governs metabolic, immune and endocrine processes through an integrated central‑peripheral network. Disruption of this rhythm plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of various liver diseases, including non‑alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcoholic liver disease, liver fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Key circadian regulators, including circadian locomotor output cycles kaput, brain and muscle ARNT‑like protein 1, period circadian regulator 1/2 and cryptochrome 1/2 modulate critical pathways, including lipid and glucose metabolism, bile acid synthesis, inflammatory responses and cellular repair, thereby contributing to the progression of liver disease. Chronotherapeutic approaches, such as targeted pharmacological treatments, time‑restricted feeding and light therapy, show promising clinical potential. However, further research is essential to clarify the underlying mechanisms and enable clinical application. By integrating foundational studies with clinical evidence, the present review provides a framework for chrono‑precision medicine in hepatology, while identifying current challenges and proposing strategies to accelerate the development and clinical implementation of circadian rhythm‑based therapies for liver disease.",2026,Jan,Molecular medicine reports,Junmin Wang; Mengxing Cao; Shen Li; Wen Pei; Jing Li; Zhen Wang,1465,True,2026-01-01
41061856,Asprosin as a regulator of hepatic lipogenesis and its association with hepatic steatosis.,"Asprosin is a recently discovered adipokine involved in the regulation of hepatic gluconeogenesis and appetite, but its role in hepatic lipid metabolism, a key aspect of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), is unknown. The aim of this study was to investigate whether asprosin could regulate hepatic lipid metabolism in vitro and in an animal model and to determine the potential association between circulating levels of asprosin and the severity of hepatic steatosis in humans. The effects of asprosin on the metabolic phenotype of mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO), as well as on de novo lipogenesis, β-oxidation, and mitochondrial function, were analyzed in both cultured primary hepatocytes and mice by assessing mRNA and protein levels of metabolic pathway components, along with mitochondrial functional. Furthermore, serum asprosin levels were measured in 314 subjects who also underwent transient elastography. The results showed that in vitro, asprosin reduced expression of lipogenic genes and increased those of fatty acid oxidation and mitochondrial activity in hepatocytes. In the DIO model, asprosin-treated mice showed reduced lipid accumulation, improved metabolic parameters and increased abundance of proteins of lipid catabolism. Furthermore, asprosin levels were positively correlated with the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness (KPa) in FibroScan measurements. Higher asprosin levels were observed in subjects with severe steatosis (S2 and S3) compared to those without (S0). This adipokine appears to play a protective role in early hepatic steatosis by modulating lipid metabolism and enhancing mitochondrial function.",2025,Oct,Journal of lipid research,Joshua Acevedo; Sophia Eugenia Martínez-Vázquez; Lilia G Noriega; Martha Guevara-Cruz; Laura Velázquez-Villegas; Mónica Sánchez-Tapia; Luis F Uscanga Domínguez; Nimbe Torres; Armando R Tovar,1699,True,2025-10-01
41066981,Modulation of molecular and serological biomarkers by (-)-epicatechin consumption on a murine model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) represents the most common liver disease worldwide. MASLD often goes undiagnosed or is not treated with specific medications. Therefore, new alternative treatments that help reverse or prevent the progression of this pathology need to be explored. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of the flavanol (-)-epicatechin (EC) on molecular and serological markers associated with MASLD progression in a murine model of MASLD induction. Three groups of C57BL6 male mice were evaluated: One group was fed standard chow (ND); two groups were fed Paigen diet and 30 % fructose (PD) to induce MASLD; one of these groups was concurrently administered with 1 mg/kg EC daily for 10 weeks. A biochemical profile and plasma TGF-β1 and TNF-α were quantified by colorimetric methods and the relative expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism, inflammatory signaling, and fibrosis development were evaluated by qRT-PCR in liver. Treatment with (-)-epicatechin reversed the elevated levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol and prevented the elevation of serum levels of TNFα and TGFβ induced by PD. At molecular level, EC downregulated the expression of Apcs, Col1a1, and Lxr and upregulated the expression of Pparγ, Pparα and Aldob, modulating the effects associated with the development of MASLD. Our results showed that (-)-epicatechin is a promising therapeutic alternative for treating MASLD.",2025,Oct,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Isabel Hidalgo; Miguel Ortiz-Flores; Javier Pérez-Durán; Guillermo Ceballos; Sergio Moreno-Vázquez; Salvador Fonseca-Coronado,1496,True,2025-10-01
41061041,Association between longitudinal weight change and clinical outcome in individuals with MASLD.,"Weight control remains the cornerstone for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) management. We assessed the relationships between dynamic weight change and the risk of liver-related events (LREs) and liver stiffness changes in MASLD. By enrolling adult MASLD individuals with ≥2 weight measurements from 16 tertiary referral centers, we assessed how longitude weight change, including the following categories (stable ≤5% change, weight loss >5% decrease, weight gain >5% increase) and changing status of obesity (persistent non-obesity, persistent obesity, transition from non-obesity to obesity, transition from obesity to non-obesity), were associated with LREs. Analyses were undertaken with multivariable linear regressions, Cox proportional hazards regression and logistic regression adjusting for age, sex, ethnicity, baseline BMI, hypertension, T2D, LSM, CAP, and SGLT-2i/GLP-1RAs usage. Analyses between weight change and liver stiffness change were also undertaken. 10,014 MASLD individuals with ≥2 weight measurements were included. Over a measurement interval of 29.2 months, 123 LREs occurred during 12.4 months follow-up after the final weight assessment. Weight gain >5% was associated with increased risk of LREs (aHR=1.84(95%CI:1.01-3.09), P=0.020) and liver stiffness progression (aOR=2.07(95%CI:1.55-2.74), P<0.001), while weight loss >5% exhibited liver stiffness improvement. Although those who progressed to or persisted with obesity, had higher LREs risk, obesity reversal had a comparable LREs risk (aHR=1.44(95%CI:0.57-3.61), P=0.435) to the persistent non-obese. In MASLD, weight gain is associated with increased LREs risks and liver stiffness progression. Conversely, weight loss confers benefits for liver stiffness improvement and modifies LREs risk in those who achieve obesity reversal.",2025,Oct,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Yu Shi; Ruoqi Zhou; Seung Up Kim; Terry Cheuk-Fung Yip; Emmanuel Tsochatzis; Salvatore Petta; Atsushi Nakajima; Hannes Hagström; Elisabetta Bugianesi; Wah-Kheong Chan; Jérôme Boursier; Boon-Bee George Goh; Arun J Sanyal; Manuel Romero-Gomez; José Luis Calleja; Victor de Lédinghen; Philip Noel Newsome; Jian-Gao Fan; Michelle Lai; Laurent Castéra; Céline Fournier-Poizat; Hye Won Lee; Grace Lai-Hung Wong; Grazia Pennisi; Masato Yoneda; Ying Shang; Angelo Armandi; Marc de Saint-Loup; Clemence M Canivet; Kevin Kim-Jun Teh; Amon Asgharpour; Rocio Gallego-Durán; Elba Llop; Carmen Lara-Romero; Mandy Sau-Wai Chan; Mirko Zoncape; Huapeng Lin; Wen-Yue Liu; Giovanni Targher; Christopher D Byrne; Vincent Wai-Sun Wong; Ming-Hua Zheng,1847,True,2025-10-01

41135998,DIATAGeR: Triacylglycerol annotation of data-independent acquisition based lipidomics.,"Triacylglycerols (TGs) are the most abundant lipids in the human body and the primary source of energy storage. TGs are comprised of three fatty acyls with various lengths and double bond composition, complicating structural annotation when performing lipidomics by LCMS. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) based lipidomics enables a continuous and unbiased acquisition of all TGs, creating the potential for more comprehensive TG analysis. However, TG identification in DIA lipidomics data is challenging due to the difficulty analyzing multiplexed tandem mass spectra (MS2). In this study, we present DIATAGeR, an R package aimed to improve and automate TG identifications to the molecular species level in DIA-based lipidomics. With DIATAGeR, TGs are identified using a TG-centric approach, where each TG in the reference database is considered as an analysis target, searched in DIA spectra, and scored using a logistic regression machine learning algorithm. Additionally, DIATAGeR uses a false discovery rate (FDR) correction calculated by a target-decoy approach to improve the confidence of TG identification and limit false positives due to interference from unrelated ions. The performance of DIATAGeR was validated in a lipidomic study of liver and plasma samples from mice with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and healthy controls. All 9 TG standards were annotated at an FDR <0.1 in both datasets. When benchmarked against MS-DIAL, TGs identified by DIATAGeR contained 18 % and 12 % more even-carbon fatty acyls in liver and plasma datasets, respectively. DIATAGeR is a valuable tool for streamlining complex TG annotation in DIA-lipidomics data. It supports vendor-neutral MS spectra data formats and offers a customizable reference database. By combining TG-centric and target-decoy approaches, DIATAGeR showed improvements in TG identification by addressing primary challenges associated with multiplexed MS2 spectra.

41036293,GLP-1 Agonists and the Risk of Pulmonary Aspiration during Elective Upper Endoscopy: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists cause delayed gastric emptying by acting on vagal afferent nerves. Retained gastric contents (RGC) increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration, particularly under anesthesia in endoscopic procedures. This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to summarize the current evidence on pulmonary aspiration in patients receiving GLP-1 agonists undergoing endoscopy. A systematic review was conducted using Cochrane, Embase, and PubMed from inception to May 2024, including studies and case reports examining GLP-1 agonists and pulmonary aspiration. Data on study characteristics, patient demographics, and GLP-1 agonist use were collected. A pooled analysis of retrospective studies was performed using RevMan version 5.4.1. The study protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (ID CRD42024595241). A total of five case reports involving six patients and twelve studies including 210,216 patients were identified. Pulmonary aspiration occurred in 143 of 87,691 patients (0.16%) in the GLP-1 agonist group and 149 of 122,525 patients (0.12%) in the placebo group. Notably, three patients experienced aspiration despite stopping GLP-1 agonists more than six days prior and fasting for over eight hours. The meta-analysis showed an odds ratio of 1.23 (P = 0.59; 95% CI, 0.58 to 2.60) for pulmonary aspiration associated with GLP-1 agonist use, which was not statistically significant. This analysis did not find a statistically significant association between GLP-1 agonist use and pulmonary aspiration risk during endoscopic procedures. While the findings align with some existing studies suggesting minimal increased risk, the presence of aspiration cases despite prolonged fasting highlights potential gaps in current peri-procedural management. Limitations include reliance on retrospective data and case reports, as well as variability in fasting protocols. The study found no significant association between GLP-1 agonist use and pulmonary aspiration risk during endoscopy. Further research is warranted to develop evidence-based fasting guidelines and optimize peri-procedural management for patients on GLP-1 agonists.",2025,01,The open respiratory medicine journal,Praveen Reddy Elmati; Gowthami Sai Kogilathota Jagirdhar; Rakhtan K Qasba; Andres Perez; Ruman K Qasba; Yatinder Bains; Mehul Shah; Salim Surani,2165,True,2025-01-01
41118258,PNPLA3-I148M genetic variant rewires lipid metabolism to drive programmed cell death in human hepatocytes.,"Genetic variants in lipid metabolism influence the risk of developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), cirrhosis, and end-stage liver disease (ESLD). The mechanisms by which these variants drive disease are poorly understood. Because of the PNPLA3-I148M variant's strong correlation with all stages of the MASLD spectrum and the lack of tractable therapeutic targets, we sought to understand its impact on cellular function and liver metabolism. Primary human hepatocytes (HAH) and iPSC-derived hepatocytes (iHeps) from healthy individuals possessing the PNPLA3-I148M mutation were characterized for changes in lipid metabolism, cellular stress, and survival. Using lipidomics, metabolomics, stable isotope tracing, and flux propensity analysis, we created a comprehensive metabolic profile of the changes associated with the PNPLA3-I148M variant. Functional analysis showed that the presence of the PNPLA3-I148M variant increased endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitochondrial dysfunction, and peroxisomal β-oxidation, ultimately leading to cell death via ferroptosis. Nutritional interventions, ferroptosis-specific inhibitors, and genetic approaches modulating GPX4 activity in PNPLA3-I148M HAH and iHeps decreased programmed cell death. Our findings indicate that therapies targeting ferroptosis in patients carrying the PNPLA3-I148M variant could affect the development of MASLD and ESLD and highlight the utility of iPSC-based models for the study of genetic contributions to hepatic disorders.",2025,Oct,JCI insight,Rodrigo M Florentino; Olamide Animasahun; Nils Haep; Minal Nenwani; Kehinde Omoloja; Leyla Nurcihan Altay; Abhinav Achreja; Kazutoyo Morita; Takashi Motomura; Ricardo Diaz-Aragon; Lanuza Ap Faccioli; Yiyue Sun; Zhenghao Liu; Zhiping Hu; Bo Yang; Fulei Wuchu; Ajay Shankaran; Miya Paserba; Annalisa M Baratta; Shohrat Arazov; Zehra N Kocas-Kilicarslan; Noah Meurs; Jaideep Behari; Edgar N Tafaleng; Jonathan Franks; Alina Ostrowska; Takahiro Tomiyama; Kyohei Yugawa; Akinari Morinaga; Zi Wang; Kazuki Takeishi; Dillon C Gavlock; Mark Miedel; D Lansing Taylor; Ira J Fox; Tomoharu Yoshizumi; Deepak Nagrath; Alejandro Soto-Gutierrez,1531,True,2025-10-01

41134319,β-Hydroxybutyrate enhances malate dehydrogenase 2 β-hydroxybutyrylation to alleviate hepatic steatosis in MASLD.,"Over the past three decades, the global prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has rapidly increased, leading to significant economic and clinical burdens. However, aside from resmetirom (Rezdiffra™), an oral thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist, there remains a lack of approved targeted pharmacological treatments for MASLD, emphasizing the need for more optimized therapeutic strategies. Given the limitations in the safety and efficacy of the ketogenic diet, β-hydroxybutyrate (β-OHB) has emerged as a crucial regulator in MASLD treatment, but the precise mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the therapeutic effects of β-OHB on MASLD mice and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. In this study, we demonstrate that β-OHB ameliorates lipid deposition and increases pan-β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) levels in both MASLD mice and in vitro. Additionally, β-OHB also improves excessive ROS accumulation and enhances mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Furthermore, β-OHB protects against impaired fatty acid oxidation (FAO) activity in MASLD. Proteomic analysis of β-OHB-treated mice identified a significant Kbhb modification at K239 on malate dehydrogenase 2 (MDH2), which was associated with increased MDH2 enzymatic activity. Overall, this study demonstrates β-OHB exhibits therapeutic effects on hepatic steatosis and mitochondrial dysfunction in MASLD mice. We uncover a novel mechanism where β-OHB enhances MDH2 enzymatic activity through Kbhb modification at K239, thereby maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis and alleviating lipid deposition.",2025,Oct,Cellular and molecular life sciences : CMLS,Jingshu Cai; Wenxuan Li; Chunli Wu; Hongbin Ni; Haiying Ran; Yi Huang; Xiufang Tang; Wenjun He; Yuanfeng Gu; Yuehua You; Jiayu Li; Xiaoqiu Xiao; Li Ma,1647,True,2025-10-01
39846038,A New Hope for the Patients of Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis: FDA Gives Green Signal for Resmetirom Use.,"Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH), a severe form of Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), is characterized by inflammation and fibrosis in the liver, often progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite its rising prevalence and significant disease burden, effective pharmacological treatments have been limited to lifestyle modifications and surgical interventions. Recently, resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist, received FDA approval for treating NASH, offering new hope to patients. This review explores the current understanding of NASH and the role of resmetirom as a breakthrough therapeutic option. This study is a comprehensive literature review analyzing peer-reviewed articles, clinical trial data, and public health reports. No original analyses were conducted, and no statistical software was utilized in this review. Resmetirom demonstrated efficacy in resolving NASH without fibrosis progression and improving fibrosis scores in patients with biopsy-confirmed NASH. In a randomized Phase 3 trial, significant histological improvements were observed in 25.9% and 29.9% of patients receiving 80 and 100 mg doses, respectively, compared to 9.7% in the placebo group. Similar trends were noted in fibrosis improvement, with 24.2% and 25.9% of patients showing ≥ 1 stage improvement compared to 14.2% in the placebo group. Adverse effects, including nausea and diarrhea, were reported more frequently in the treatment groups, but the rates of serious adverse events were comparable across groups. The approval of resmetirom marks a significant advancement in the treatment of NASH, addressing the limitations of lifestyle-based interventions. As the obesity epidemic drives the increasing prevalence of NASH, resmetirom provides a promising therapeutic option, paving the way for improved patient outcomes and future research.",2025,Jan,Health science reports,Abdul Haseeb Hasan; Muhammad Ali Abid; Muhammad Hafi Abid; Laiba Suhail; Abubakar Nazir,1873,True,2025-01-01
39699315,Thyroid hormone and the Liver.,"It is known that thyroid hormone can regulate hepatic metabolic pathways including cholesterol, de novo lipogenesis, fatty acid oxidation, lipophagy, and carbohydrate metabolism. Thyroid hormone action is mediated by the thyroid hormone receptor (THR) isoforms and their coregulators, and THRβ is the main isoform expressed in the liver. Dysregulation of thyroid hormone levels, as seen in hypothyroidism, has been associated with dyslipidemia and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease. Given the beneficial effects of thyroid hormone in liver metabolism and the advances illuminating the use of thyroid hormone analogs such as resmetirom as therapeutic agents in the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease, this review aims to further explore the relationship between TH, the liver, and metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease.

This study sought to discover clinically relevant biomarkers for STAD by integrating bioinformatics analysis and in vitro experimental methods. We utilized the GSE64951 dataset to screen for differentially expressed genes (DEGs), which were then subjected to weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Candidate modules were subjected to Molecular Complex Detection (MCODE) analysis to extract key genes. Survival analysis and immune infiltration analysis were conducted to identify hub genes associated with STAD prognosis. Among them, cytochrome c oxidase subunit 7 C (COX7C) was selected for further investigation. Its expression levels in normal versus tumor tissues were compared, and its diagnostic performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Functional experiments, including COX7C overexpression and knockdown, were performed in MGC803 cells to evaluate its effects on viability, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. WGCNA identified multiple gene modules, among which the blue and turquoise modules showed the strongest correlations with clinical traits and were selected for further analysis. MCODE analysis identified 11 key genes. COX7C was identified as hub gene, and its prognostic signature demonstrated robust predictive power. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) indicated that COX7C was significantly involved in pathways such as amino acid metabolism and non - alcoholic fatty liver disease. Notably, COX7C mRNA expression was significantly downregulated in STAD tissues (AUC = 0.7253, P = 0.0032). Functional experiments demonstrated that overexpression of COX7C significantly inhibited cell viability, promoted apoptosis, and reduced cell migration and invasion. Conversely, knockdown of COX7C led to opposite effects. COX7C functions as a tumor suppressor and a potential prognostic biomarker in STAD. These findings provide new insights into STAD pathogenesis and suggest COX7C as a promising target for improving diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",2025,Oct,BMC gastroenterology,Conglai Shi; Qiang Wang; Xin Zhang; Weiguo Wang; Wei Wang; Ziran Wei; Yue Liu,2103,True,2025-10-01

41141263,Synergistic potential of natural products and exercise: unveiling molecular mechanisms and innovative therapeutic approaches for liver diseases.,"Liver diseases, particularly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), have grown to be significant global health issues. These conditions are strongly associated with metabolic syndrome, obesity, and diabetes. The management of chronic illnesses still necessitates lifestyle changes, such as improved diet and increased physical activity, despite advances in pharmaceutical therapies. With their numerous bioactive constituents, natural products have shown significant hepatoprotective effects through lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammatory modulation. Key natural substances, including resveratrol, curcumin, and silymarin, have demonstrated potential in clinical and experimental settings by influencing molecular pathways essential to liver health. Simultaneously, exercise interventions, specifically resistance and aerobic training, have successfully improved insulin sensitivity, decreased intrahepatic fat, and enhanced metabolic performance. Recent research suggests that the combined use of natural products and exercise represents a novel therapeutic approach. This approach may offer a therapeutic synergy that targets underlying biological mechanisms and circumvents some of the limitations of existing therapies. Furthermore, probiotic-induced microbiota modification and the gut-liver axis provide new perspectives on the holistic treatment of liver disease. This review underscores the urgent need for more studies to maximize integrative therapy approaches, identifies current research gaps, and summarizes recent developments on the combined effects of exercise and natural products in preventing and treating liver disease. These revelations open the door to creative treatments that enhance liver health and lessen the prevalence of liver illnesses worldwide, highlighting the crucial role of further research in this field.",2025,01,Frontiers in nutrition,Qi Ye; Shoudu Yuan; Deliang Cai,1929,True,2025-01-01
40494889,Immunopathogenic mechanisms and immunoregulatory therapies in MASLD.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide, with an estimated global prevalence of approximately 30%; however, effective pharmacotherapies are still limited due to its complex pathogenesis and etiology. Therefore, a more thorough understanding of disease pathogenesis is urgently needed. An increasing number of studies suggest that MASLD and its progressive form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), are driven by chronic overnutrition, multiple genetic susceptibility factors, and pathogenic consequences, including hepatocyte damage and liver inflammation. Hepatic inflammation is the key event fueling the conversion from simple steatosis to steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Current therapies for MASH, including the recently approved thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist resmetirom or the available incretin mimetics, mainly target metabolic injury to the liver but not inflammation directly. In this review, we provide an in-depth discussion of current data related to the immunological mechanisms of MASLD and summarize the effects of current and experimental therapies on immunoregulation in MASLD.",2025,Oct,Cellular & molecular immunology,Yong He; Yingfen Chen; Shengying Qian; Schalk van Der Merwe; Debanjan Dhar; David A Brenner; Frank Tacke,1265,True,2025-10-01
40016997,The pleiotropic effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis: a review for gastroenterologists.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) or glucagon receptor agonists have emerged as promising agents to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)/metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Although the beneficial effects of GLP-1RAs on glycemic control and weight are well-established, clinicians may be unfamiliar with other potential benefits of this class. We examined the pleiotropic effects of GLP-1RAs and how they relate to gastroenterologists for MASLD/MASH treatment. Our narrative review of English articles included four GLP-1RAs (subcutaneous semaglutide, liraglutide, dulaglutide, and efpeglenatide), a dual GLP-1/GIP agonist (tirzepatide), a dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist (survodutide), MASLD/MASH, related disorders, clinical management, treatment outcomes and landscape. In Phase I - III trials, GLP-1RAs are associated with clinically relevant hepatic improvements including MASH resolution, liver fat reduction, and preventing worsening fibrosis. Effects on cardiometabolic parameters align with type 2 diabetes/obesity Phase III data, comprising substantial improvements in glycemic, weight, and cardiovascular outcomes. Promising data also suggest benefits in common comorbidities, including obstructive sleep apnea, polycystic ovary syndrome, chronic kidney disease, and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction.GLP-1RAs represent a valuable pharmacotherapeutic option for gastroenterologists managing individuals with MASLD/MASH and cardiometabolic comorbid conditions.",2025,Mar,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Naim Alkhouri; Michael Charlton; Meagan Gray; Mazen Noureddin,1626,True,2025-03-01

We conducted a retrospective cross-sectional study using anonymized data from 966 patients who received liraglutide prescriptions through a DTC platform between August 2022 and April 2024. Patients completed an initial online questionnaire to assess eligibility, followed by a physician's review. A follow-up questionnaire was administered 50 days after the first prescription to evaluate outcomes, including weight loss, adverse events, and treatment satisfaction. The majority of patients (70%) had long-standing obesity, with 46.6% having a BMI between 30 and 34.4 kg/m². Most (88.9%) were new to glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists therapy. After 50 days, 85.6% of patients reported a weight loss of more than 2 kg, with an average loss of 4.9 kg. Adverse events were reported by 39.8% of patients, primarily gastrointestinal issues. Treatment adherence was high, with 94.1% following the prescribed regimen. Despite adverse events, 86.4% of patients expressed a desire to continue treatment. This study demonstrates the potential effectiveness and accessibility of DTC telemedicine for obesity treatment using liraglutide, though gastrointestinal side effects were common. The findings support the use of DTC platforms for weight management, yet further research with longer follow-up and professional evaluation is necessary to confirm long-term safety and efficacy.",2025,01,Digital health,Monika Gratzke; Johannes von Bueren; Edward Garrahy; Bart Calewaert; Finn Abeck; Christian Wuelfing,1619,True,2025-01-01

Autophagy is involved in the occurrence and development of MASLD. Naringin is a flavonoid compound with anti-inflammatory and anti-oxidation effects. This study is to investigate the impact of naringin on autophagy in an organoid model of tissue-engineered fatty liver (TEF). Human hepatocytes were cultured on a rat liver biomatrix scaffold and perfused with fat-supplemented medium to establish 3D MASLD models. Naringin was treated for 3 days. Histopathological changes were determined by oil red O and hematoxylin-eosin staining; organelle morphology was examined by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy (TEM); the expression of autophagy-related factors was analyzed by qPCR and Western Blot. Hepatocyte injury was determined by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase dUTP Nick End Labeling (TUNEL) staining, cell counting and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) detection. The results showed naringin significantly improved liver injury in the MASLD model, as evidenced by increased cell viability, reduced lipid accumulation and LDH release. TEM revealed the presence of autophagosomes in naringin-treated hepatocytes. Naringin upregulated the expression of autophagy-related proteins (LC3, ATG5, ATG7) and promoted the LC3-II/LC3-I ratio, indicating enhanced autophagic flux. Furthermore, naringin regulated the mTOR-ULK1 signaling pathway by downregulating p-mTOR and p-ULK1 (Ser757) and upregulating Beclin1. Autophagy inhibitors (3-Methyladenine and SBI-0206965) attenuated the protective effects of naringin, confirming the role of autophagy in hepatocyte protection. Naringin mitigates liver damage in the TEF model by enhancing autophagy via mTOR-ULK1 pathway, highlighting its potential as a therapeutic agent for MASLD.",2025,Oct,Molecular biology reports,Jihui Jia; Yizhi Zhang; Jing Lin; Zhongping Duan; Yu Chen; Xiaohui Zhang,1875,True,2025-10-01
38324483,"A Phase 3, Randomized, Controlled Trial of Resmetirom in NASH with Liver Fibrosis.","Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive liver disease with no approved treatment. Resmetirom is an oral, liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor beta-selective agonist in development for the treatment of NASH with liver fibrosis. We are conducting an ongoing phase 3 trial involving adults with biopsy-confirmed NASH and a fibrosis stage of F1B, F2, or F3 (stages range from F0 [no fibrosis] to F4 [cirrhosis]). Patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive once-daily resmetirom at a dose of 80 mg or 100 mg or placebo. The two primary end points at week 52 were NASH resolution (including a reduction in the nonalcoholic fatty liver disease [NAFLD] activity score by ≥2 points; scores range from 0 to 8, with higher scores indicating more severe disease) with no worsening of fibrosis, and an improvement (reduction) in fibrosis by at least one stage with no worsening of the NAFLD activity score. Overall, 966 patients formed the primary analysis population (322 in the 80-mg resmetirom group, 323 in the 100-mg resmetirom group, and 321 in the placebo group). NASH resolution with no worsening of fibrosis was achieved in 25.9% of the patients in the 80-mg resmetirom group and 29.9% of those in the 100-mg resmetirom group, as compared with 9.7% of those in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). Fibrosis improvement by at least one stage with no worsening of the NAFLD activity score was achieved in 24.2% of the patients in the 80-mg resmetirom group and 25.9% of those in the 100-mg resmetirom group, as compared with 14.2% of those in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). The change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels from baseline to week 24 was -13.6% in the 80-mg resmetirom group and -16.3% in the 100-mg resmetirom group, as compared with 0.1% in the placebo group (P<0.001 for both comparisons with placebo). Diarrhea and nausea were more frequent with resmetirom than with placebo. The incidence of serious adverse events was similar across trial groups: 10.9% in the 80-mg resmetirom group, 12.7% in the 100-mg resmetirom group, and 11.5% in the placebo group.

However, liver fibrosis can arise from various pathogenic factors, and effective treatments for fibrosis due to other causes remain elusive. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) represents a central link in the pathogenesis of hepatic fibrosis. Therefore, harnessing nuclear receptors to modulate HSC activation may be an effective approach to resolving the complex liver fibrosis caused by various factors. In this comprehensive review, we systematically explore the structure and physiological functions of nuclear receptors, shedding light on their multifaceted roles in HSC activation. Recent advancements in drug development targeting nuclear receptors are discussed, providing insights into their potential as rational and effective therapeutic targets for modulating HSC activation in the context of liver fibrosis.

41005135,Heteropolymer ferritin nanocages as delivery vehicles for oral delivery of GLP-1 peptides.,"Bioactive peptides have attracted significant attention for their potential health benefits; however, their oral administration is challenged by degradation from digestive proteases and limited intestinal absorption. In this study, we demonstrated the exceptional gastrointestinal stability of ferritin nanocages, which remained largely intact after 30 min of simulated gastric digestion and were highly resistant to intestinal proteolysis. Consistent with in vitro findings, orally administered ferritin successfully reached the intestinal tract without significant degradation in mice. We engineered a fusion protein by linking a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) motif to the C-terminus of heteropolymer ferritin, generating HLG. Through Caco-2 monolayer assays, we confirmed that HLG absorption occurs primarily via TfR1-mediated endocytosis, followed by lysosomal trafficking and subsequent release of bioactive GLP-1. Oral administration of HLG significantly reduced blood glucose levels and food intake in type 2 diabetic mice, whereas the GLP-1 analog exenatide alone showed no such effects.

41085660,Global burden of MASLD-IBD comorbidity from 1990 to 2021 and trend prediction to 2050.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a prevalent chronic liver disorder, imposes a substantial global clinical and economic burden. Emerging evidence underscores inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) as a significant independent risk factor for MASLD. However, the global burden and trends of MASLD-IBD comorbidity remain largely obscured. To evaluate the global MASLD-IBD burden from 1990 to 2021, and project trajectories to 2050, informing proactive public health strategies. Leveraging the GBD 2021 database, we quantified IBD's contribution to MASLD via population-attributable fractions (PAF). We analysed the global prevalence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), stratifying by socio-demographic index (SDI), sex, and age. Estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) assessed 1990-2021 trends; Bayesian age-period-cohort modelling projected 2050 trajectories. In 2021, the global age-standardized prevalence of MASLD-IBD comorbidity reached 171.7 cases (95% UI: 157.3-187.1), with a corresponding DALY rate of 0.5 cases (95% UI: 0.4-0.6) per 10 million population. High-income regions, including North America, Australia, and Western Europe, bore the highest burden. From 1990 to 2021, 20 out of 21 GBD regions exhibited escalating age-standardized prevalence and DALY rates, most markedly in East Asia (prevalence EAPC = 3.18; 95% CI: 2.59-3.77) and East Europe (DALY EAPC = 4.05; 95% CI: 3.32-4.79). Middle SDI regions saw the largest absolute increases, with mortality mirroring DALY trends. Adults ≥ 60 years bore disproportionately higher burdens. By 2050, projections suggest divergent gender trends of rising female burden versus declining male rates.

41023473,The effects of incretins as a double-edged sword on cancer.,"Incretins, such as Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and Glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), are hormones known to stimulate insulin secretion and are widely used in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Recent evidence suggests that these hormones, and incretin-based therapies like DPP-4 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists, may have proliferative effects on pancreatic β-cells, raising concerns about a potential link to certain cancers. This review aims to evaluate both the beneficial and detrimental effects of incretins in cancer development and therapy. We conducted a comprehensive review of clinical cohort studies, as well as in vivo and in vitro investigations, to assess the dual role of incretin-based therapies in cancer risk and potential treatment. The molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying these effects were critically analyzed. While some studies have suggested an increased risk of pancreatic, thyroid, cholangiocarcinoma, and colorectal cancers associated with incretin therapies-especially in genetically predisposed individuals-other research has demonstrated anticancer effects in prostate, breast, ovarian, and other cancers through various mechanisms. These include inhibition of tumor proliferation, induction of apoptosis, and modulation of immune responses. Although incretin-based drugs may pose a cancer risk in specific tissues, particularly in susceptible individuals, their therapeutic potential in mitigating other cancer types appears promising.

41096980,Obesity-Driven Metabolic Disorders: The Interplay of Inflammation and Mitochondrial Dysfunction.,"Obesity contributes to the development of metabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) through sustained low-grade inflammation and mitochondrial dysfunction. In obesity, hypertrophied adipose tissue release high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β, and elevates circulating free fatty acids. These changes promote systemic insulin resistance and ectopic lipid deposition. Mitochondrial dysfunction, including reduced oxidative phosphorylation, excess reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial DNA damage, further stimulate inflammatory pathways such as the NLRP3 inflammasome, creating a feedback loop that worsens metabolic stress.

40026701,Comparative Efficacy of NAFLD Therapies and Biomarker Associations: A Meta-Analysis Based on Liver Fat Content.,"This study aims to conduct a comprehensive quantitative analysis of various nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) therapeutics, utilizing magnetic resonance (MR)-detected liver fat content (LFC) as the efficacy endpoint, and to identify biomarkers correlated with changes in LFC based on published literature. We performed a systematic search of public databases for placebo-controlled randomized trials on NAFLD up to September 29, 2023. A random-effects meta-analysis was employed to assess efficacy differences between drugs with various mechanisms and placebo. Initial Pearson correlation analysis explored the relationships between biomarkers and LFC. For biomarkers showing significant correlations with LFC, further modeling analysis was conducted to examine their relationship characteristics. Our analysis included 36 studies with 3222 subjects and 33 investigational drugs, which were categorized into 6 mechanistic groups. Drugs such as fibroblast growth factor agonists, and those targeting adipocytes, inflammation, or fibrosis, showed greater efficacy in reducing LFC compared to Resmetirom, which has an efficacy of reducing LFC by 5.2%. From the 121 biomarkers analyzed, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase demonstrated moderate correlations with LFC; specifically, changes of -5.9 U/L in alanine aminotransferase or -3.3 U/L in aspartate aminotransferase were associated with an additional 1% reduction in LFC. The results of this study provide valuable insights for the clinical development of future NAFLD therapeutics, highlighting the efficacy of specific drug mechanisms and the potential of certain biomarkers as surrogate endpoints.",2025,01,Gastro hep advances,Haoxiang Zhu; Ling Xu; Yinhua Lv; Juan Yang; Jihan Huang; Qingshan Zheng; Guang Ji; Lujin Li,1680,True,2025-01-01

The increasing prevalence of Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) among individuals with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) also presents new complications in management. The study aimed to investigate the relationship between MASLD and HBV DNA clearance in CHB patients with normal ALT. 403 patients with ALT levels below the normal threshold who underwent liver biopsy at our institution and subsequently received antiviral therapy with NAs were retrospectively examined. Among these, 177 patients were diagnosed with MASLD. Further single cell data analysis was conducted on GSE192740 and GSE182159. CHB patients concurrent with MASLD had a higher probability of achieving HBV DNA clearance. The proportion of CD8+Teff-GZMH cells was increased in the MASLD group. The interactions among CD8+ Trm-CD69 cells and other T cell subtypes were enhanced, especially within the active CCL-CCR pathways. An elevated proportion of Monocyte-THBS1 was also observed. CD8+ Trm-CD69 T cells may be activated by Monocyte-THBS1 cells, thereby stimulating the immune system via the CCL-CCR signaling axis. This activation facilitates the recruitment of immune cells and enhances the clearance of hepatitis B virus (HBV).",2025,01,Frontiers in cellular and infection microbiology,Chao Cai; Wen-Xuan Shang; Si-Jie Zheng; Chen Chen; Ke Xu; Lu Chen; Ya-Jie Wang; Yu-Qun Wang; Rui-Cong Chen; Yi-Jing Cai; Hui-Fang Zhang; Chen Huang; Ji Lin; Bang-Guo Zhou; Xiu-Li Lin; Lei Zhang; Ming-Qin Lu,1372,True,2025-01-01
39359614,Unveiling Resmetirom: A systematic review and meta-analysis on its impact on liver function and safety in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis treatment.,"The role of Resmetirom in non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) represents a promising therapeutic approach in addressing the growing global burden of liver disease. With NASH emerging as a leading cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality worldwide, there is an urgent need for effective treatments. Resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist, offers potential benefits in improving liver histology and metabolic parameters in patients with NASH. This review examines the current evidence surrounding Resmetirom's role in NASH management. A systematic review and meta-analysis was done by searching in Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), PubMed, MEDLINE (including MEDLINE InProcess) (OvidSP), Web of Science, Embase (OvidSP), and Scopus databases. ROB2 Cochrane tool was used for assessing risk of bias in randomized controlled trials (RCTs). In the analysis, we used RevMan Cochrane software. The study showed that patients who were treated with Resmetirom had significantly lower low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (mean difference [MD] -10.45; 95% confidence interval [CI] -15.86 to -5.83;  Resmetirom presents a promising therapeutic option for NASH, offering potential benefits in reducing liver fat content and improving histological outcomes. The encouraging results from clinical trials suggest that Resmetirom may address an unmet need in NASH management, providing hope for patients with this progressive liver disease.

41152536,Gut-brain communication: types of sensory nerves and mechanisms of activation.,"Understanding the locations of extrinsic sensory nerve endings in the gastrointestinal tract and their mechanisms of activation is essential to advancing our understanding of how communication along the gut-brain axis affects health and disease. The gastrointestinal tract detects diverse stimuli (chemical, mechanical and thermal signals) via two major types of primary afferent (sensory) nerves: vagal and spinal afferents. Viscerofugal neurons represent a third pathway that has been indirectly implicated in gut-brain signalling. These spinal and vagal afferents transmit sensory signals to the brain through distinct pathways, and although the origins of their nerve cell bodies are known, their nerve endings remain poorly understood. New evidence indicates that single dorsal root ganglia neurons can give rise to multiple different morphological types of endings within different gut layers, and that Piezo2 channels have a major role in detecting mechanosensory stimuli by gut-projecting spinal afferents. Morphological studies suggest that substances released from enteroendocrine cells can activate the terminals of vagal and spinal afferent endings within the mucosa through a paracrine mechanism. Here, we review the distinct spinal and vagal afferent types alongside viscerofugal pathways revealed by advances in neurogenetic techniques and high-resolution anterograde tracing, linking them to their physiological role in gut-brain communication.",2025,Oct,Nature reviews.

The aim of this study was to determine the diagnostic performance and optimal cut-off values of blood pressure for detecting NAFLD defined by fatty liver index (FLI). This cross-sectional study included 1227 participants aged 35-55 years. NAFLD was determined by FLI with a cut-off value of ≥60. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic ability of blood pressure parameters for screening FLI-defined NAFLD and to determine their cut-off values. The results of this study showed that systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly correlated with FLI values. The prevalence of NAFLD defined by FLI was 23.5% in men and 18.2% in women. The ROC curve analysis showed a good ability of blood pressure for the prediction of FLI-defined NAFLD. The optimal cut-off values of SBP and DBP were 136 mmHg and 88 mmHg in men and 137 mmHg and 85 mmHg in women, respectively. Thus, high-normal blood pressure is associated with the risk of NAFLD defined by FLI in both men and women.",2025,Oct,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,Anastasiya M Kaneva; Evgeny R Bojko,1251,True,2025-10-01
41017581,The estrous cycle moderates the food and body weight suppressive effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonism.,"Emerging data suggest more young women than men are prescribed weight loss pharmacotherapies targeting the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R). However, preclinical literature has largely used male animals to characterize the neural mechanisms underlying the weight loss abilities of GLP-1R agonists (GLP-1RAs), highlighting a need for female-specific investigations. Recently, we described data pointing to the female estrous cycle as a possible moderator of GLP-1RA's effects in rats. Expression of brainstem Glp1r and the GLP-1 precursor gene, Gcg, increased during two estrous phases, proestrus and estrus (P/E), compared to males and compared to other phases, metestrus and diestrus (M/D). On this basis, we hypothesized that the weight-reducing effects of GLP-1RAs may be potentiated during P/E. In separate experiments, we determined whether timing administration of acute liraglutide or chronic semaglutide to either P/E or M/D would moderate food intake and weight loss in female rats maintained on a high fat diet. We also used qPCR to explore estrous cycle-dependent variation in Glp1r within widely distributed nuclei relevant to energy balance control. GLP-1RA administration during P/E, compared to M/D, enhanced the intake-suppressive effects of liraglutide and semaglutide. Moreover, semaglutide administered only during P/E led to greater body weight loss compared to M/D-administered semaglutide. We also observed greater Glp1r expression in P/E compared to M/D in multiple nuclei. GLP-1RAs administered in P/E lead to significantly greater body weight loss via reduction in food intake. Collectively, these data may have translational implications for the timing of GLP-1RA administration across the menstrual cycle.",2025,Sep,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Sarah V Applebey; Allison G Xiao; Benjamin C Reiner; Matthew R Hayes,1742,True,2025-09-01
41161498,Hepatic lipidomics reveals lipid metabolism reprogramming response to different branched-chain amino acids interventions in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease of laying hens.,"Dietary restrictions of protein or branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) reprogram lipid metabolism and ameliorate metabolic health. However, dietary high protein (enriched in BCAA) or BCAA supplementation is effective for the therapy of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), yet their metabolic effects on hepatic lipidomic changes and how the response to different BCAA interventions have not been systemically characterized. Here, we comprehensively analyzed the hepatic lipid landscape following different BCAA interventions and identified over 1400 unique lipid species. Strikingly, we find that High Leu intervention upregulates the synthesis of diacylglycerols (DGs) and monoacylglycerols (MGs), and preferentially downregulates glycerophospholipid metabolism and autophagy, but fails to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway. High Ile and High LeuIle interventions activate glycerophospholipid metabolism and induce the inhibition of MAPK and autophagy signaling pathways, whereas they are toxic and adverse to metabolic health and contribute to insulin resistance. Intriguingly, we find High BCAA feeding strongly reprograms the hepatic lipidome by activating the MAPK and autophagy signaling pathways and downregulating glycerophospholipid metabolism. By integrating multi-omics approaches, we uncovered the cross-talk between amino acid metabolism, tryptophan metabolites, and lipidome remodeling in response to High BCAA intervention. Our results highlight the differential hepatic lipidome alterations in response to distinct dietary BCAA interventions and suggest that modest BCAA supplementation may serve as a new approach for treating and preventing NAFLD in humans and fatty liver hemorrhagic syndrome (FLHS) in laying hens.",2025,Oct,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,Huafeng Jian; Fengcheng Miao; Yi Zheng; Zhiyu Li; Yao Shen; Xiaoqian Long; Bing Dai; Hua Yang; Xiaoting Zou; Jiangang Ma,1766,True,2025-10-01

40843857,"Obesity: Clinical Impact, Pathophysiology, Complications, and Modern Innovations in Therapeutic Strategies.","Obesity is a growing global health concern with widespread impacts on physical, psychological, and social well-being. Clinically, it is a major driver of type 2 diabetes (T2D), cardiovascular disease (CVD), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and cancer, reducing life expectancy by 5-20 years and imposing a staggering economic burden of USD 2 trillion annually (2.8% of global GDP). Despite its significant health and socioeconomic impact, earlier obesity medications, such as fenfluramine, sibutramine, and orlistat, fell short of expectations due to limited effectiveness, serious side effects including valvular heart disease and gastrointestinal issues, and high rates of treatment discontinuation. The advent of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (e.g., semaglutide, tirzepatide) has revolutionized obesity management. These agents demonstrate unprecedented efficacy, achieving 15-25% mean weight loss in clinical trials, alongside reducing major adverse cardiovascular events by 20% and T2D incidence by 72%. Emerging therapies, including oral GLP-1 agonists and triple-receptor agonists (e.g., retatrutide), promise enhanced tolerability and muscle preservation, potentially bridging the efficacy gap with bariatric surgery. However, challenges persist. High costs, supply shortages, and unequal access pose significant barriers to the widespread implementation of obesity treatment, particularly in low-resource settings. Gastrointestinal side effects and long-term safety concerns require close monitoring, while weight regain after medication discontinuation emphasizes the need for ongoing adherence and lifestyle support. This review highlights the transformative potential of incretin-based therapies while advocating for policy reforms to address cost barriers, equitable access, and preventive strategies. Future research must prioritize long-term cardiovascular outcome trials and mitigate emerging risks, such as sarcopenia and joint degeneration. A multidisciplinary approach combining pharmacotherapy, behavioral interventions, and systemic policy changes is critical to curbing the obesity epidemic and its downstream consequences.",2025,Jul,"Medicines (Basel, Switzerland)",Mohammad Iftekhar Ullah; Sadeka Tamanna,2176,True,2025-07-01

Beyond weight loss and glycemic control, emerging evidence suggests they may also exert cardioprotective effects. In the context of heart failure (HF), particularly HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), GLP-1RAs have been associated with improvement in symptoms, physical capacity, biomarkers, and structural cardiac remodeling. These benefits appear to be independent of weight loss, suggesting additional mechanisms including anti-inflammatory effects, improved myocardial metabolism or modulation of epicardial adipose tissue. However, current data largely come from non-HF dedicated trials, with limited standardization of the HF phenotype. Results are overall inconsistent and may suggest potential harm in some cases, particularly in HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).

Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) and dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and GLP-1 RA (GIP/GLP-1 RA) have emerged as a promising therapy in T1D. Previous studies have shown that patients with T1D can significantly improve glycemic control while experiencing a reduction in insulin dose and body weight when long-acting GLP-1RAs or GIP/GLP-1RAs are added to insulin therapy. However, randomized controlled trials (RCT) are still insufficient. This is a prospective, randomized, parallel-group, open-label, superiority-controlled design that evaluates the safety and efficacy of adding tirzepatide to insulin therapy in participants with T1D under automated insulin delivery (AID) control.

While its association with chronic conditions is well-established, its impact on liver disease remains underexplored. This systematic review synthesizes evidence on the impact of food insecurity on liver disease development, progression, and outcomes, identifying gaps and informing future research and public health strategies. Databases including Medline, CINAHL, Embase, and Web of Science were searched comprehensively through April 2025. Studies evaluating food insecurity and liver disease outcomes were included.

Of 17,609 studies identified, 17 met the inclusion criteria, predominantly from the United States. Most studies focused on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Food insecurity was linked to increased odds of MASLD, advanced fibrosis, and mortality, with higher rates of hepatic steatosis, liver stiffness, and fibrosis progression in both pediatric and adult populations. Food insecurity was measured primarily using the USDA Household Food Security Survey Module, and liver outcomes via noninvasive techniques and biomarkers. Food insecurity is a potentially modifiable risk factor for liver disease progression, emphasizing the need for targeted interventions.

The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted the importance of timely and all-cause mortality estimates for being able to respond to changing trends in health outcomes, showing a strong need for demographic analysis tools that can produce all-cause mortality estimates more rapidly with more readily available all-age vital registration (VR) data. The Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) is an ongoing research effort that quantifies human health by estimating a range of epidemiological quantities of interest across time, age, sex, location, cause, and risk. This study-part of the latest GBD release, GBD 2023-aims to provide new and updated estimates of all-cause mortality and life expectancy for 1950 to 2023 using a novel statistical model that accounts for complex correlation structures in demographic data across age and time. We used 24 025 data sources from VR, sample registration, surveys, censuses, and other sources to estimate all-cause mortality for males, females, and all sexes combined across 25 age groups in 204 countries and territories as well as 660 subnational units in 20 countries and territories, for the years 1950-2023. For the first time, we used complete birth history data for ages 5-14 years, age-specific sibling history data for ages 15-49 years, and age-specific mortality data from Health and Demographic Surveillance Systems. We developed a single statistical model that incorporates both parametric and non-parametric methods, referred to as OneMod, to produce estimates of all-cause mortality for each age-sex-location group. OneMod includes two main steps: a detailed regression analysis with a generalised linear modelling tool that accounts for age-specific covariate effects such as the Socio-demographic Index (SDI) and a population attributable fraction (PAF) for all risk factors combined; and a non-parametric analysis of residuals using a multivariate kernel regression model that smooths across age and time to adaptably follow trends in the data without overfitting. We calibrated asymptotic uncertainty estimates using Pearson residuals to produce 95% uncertainty intervals (UIs) and corresponding 1000 draws. Life expectancy was calculated from age-specific mortality rates with standard demographic methods. For each measure, 95% UIs were calculated with the 25th and 975th ordered values from a 1000-draw posterior distribution. In 2023, 60·1 million (95% UI 59·0-61·1) deaths occurred globally, of which 4·67 million (4·59-4·75) were in children younger than 5 years. Due to considerable population growth and ageing since 1950, the number of annual deaths globally increased by 35·2% (32·2-38·4) over the 1950-2023 study period, during which the global age-standardised all-cause mortality rate declined by 66·6% (65·8-67·3). Trends in age-specific mortality rates between 2011 and 2023 varied by age group and location, with the largest decline in under-5 mortality occurring in east Asia (67·7% decrease); the largest increases in mortality for those aged 5-14 years, 25-29 years, and 30-39 years occurring in high-income North America (11·5%, 31·7%, and 49·9%, respectively); and the largest increases in mortality for those aged 15-19 years and 20-24 years occurring in Eastern Europe (53·9% and 40·1%, respectively). We also identified higher than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 5-14 years (87·3% higher in GBD 2023 than GBD 2021 on average across countries and territories over the 1950-2021 period) and for females aged 15-29 years (61·2% higher), as well as lower than previously estimated mortality rates in sub-Saharan Africa for all sexes combined aged 50 years and older (13·2% lower), reflecting advances in our modelling approach. Global life expectancy followed three distinct trends over the study period. First, between 1950 and 2019, there were considerable improvements, from 51·2 (50·6-51·7) years for females and 47·9 (47·4-48·4) years for males in 1950 to 76·3 (76·2-76·4) years for females and 71·4 (71·3-71·5) years for males in 2019. Second, this period was followed by a decrease in life expectancy during the COVID-19 pandemic, to 74·7 (74·6-74·8) years for females and 69·3 (69·2-69·4) years for males in 2021. Finally, the world experienced a period of post-pandemic recovery in 2022 and 2023, wherein life expectancy generally returned to pre-pandemic (2019) levels in 2023 (76·3 [76·0-76·6] years for females and 71·5 [71·2-71·8] years for males). 194 (95·1%) of 204 countries and territories experienced at least partial post-pandemic recovery in age-standardised mortality rates by 2023, with 61·8% (126 of 204) recovering to or falling below pre-pandemic levels. There were several mortality trajectories during and following the pandemic across countries and territories. Long-term mortality trends also varied considerably between age groups and locations, demonstrating the diverse landscape of health outcomes globally. This analysis identified several key differences in mortality trends from previous estimates, including higher rates of adolescent mortality, higher rates of young adult mortality in females, and lower rates of mortality in older age groups in much of sub-Saharan Africa. The findings also highlight stark differences across countries and territories in the timing and scale of changes in all-cause mortality trends during and following the COVID-19 pandemic (2020-23). Our estimates of evolving trends in mortality and life expectancy across locations, ages, sexes, and SDI levels in recent years as well as over the entire 1950-2023 study period provide crucial information for governments, policy makers, and the public to ensure that health-care systems, economies, and societies are prepared to address the world's health needs, particularly in populations with higher rates of mortality than previously known. The estimates from this study provide a robust framework for GBD and a valuable foundation for policy development, implementation, and evaluation around the world.

41096891,Diet and Lifestyle Interventions in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease: A Comprehensive Review.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its progressive form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), have become the leading causes of chronic liver disease worldwide, with increasing rates of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and cardiovascular complications. Pathogenesis involves a complex interplay of dietary excess, sedentary lifestyle, insulin resistance, adipose tissue dysfunction, and alterations in the gut microbiome, which collectively lead to hepatocellular stress, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. Despite ongoing advances in pharmacotherapy, lifestyle intervention remains the cornerstone of management. Evidence shows that sustained weight loss of ≥5% reduces hepatic steatosis, ≥7% improves necroinflammation, and ≥10% stabilizes or reverses fibrosis. Dietary strategies, including Mediterranean-style patterns, high-protein approaches, and intermittent fasting, have been shown to be effective in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing intrahepatic triglycerides. Exercise interventions, focusing on both aerobic fitness and resistance training, enhance metabolic flexibility and combat sarcopenia, thereby improving hepatic and systemic outcomes. Equally important are behavioral support, digital health tools, and multidisciplinary approaches that enhance adherence and address barriers such as socioeconomic disparities, limited access, and patient engagement issues. Personalized nutrition plans, integrating physical activity, and ongoing support for behavioral change are essential for long-term disease management. This review synthesizes current evidence on the roles of macronutrients, micronutrients, dietary quality, physical activity, and adjunctive behavioral strategies in managing MASLD. By translating mechanistic insights into practical, evidence-based recommendations, we aim to provide clinicians, dietitians, and exercise professionals with effective frameworks to slow disease progression and improve outcomes across diverse patient populations.",2025,Oct,International journal of molecular sciences,Muhammad Y Sheikh; Muhammad F Younus; Annie Shergill; Muhammad N Hasan,2039,True,2025-10-01

Materials and Methods: 112 patients with GERD were examined. Patients were divided into two groups. Group 1 included 50 patients with GERD, and group 2 consisted of 62 patients with GERD in combination with MDAFLD. The level of homocysteine and B vitamins in the blood serum was determined. Results: At patients group 1 were diagnosed the decreased levels of B6 and B12 in blood serum against a background of a slight increase in homocysteine levels in blood serum (up to 17.9±0.7 umol/l - p<0.05). In patients in group 2, a significant decrease in all B vitamins examined in the blood serum was found, accompanied by a significant increase in homocysteine levels (2.4 times - p<0.01). Conclusions: In the vast majority of patients with GERD and MDAFLD, an increase in BMI was found, namely, overweight in 25.8% (p < 0.01) of patients and grade I obesity (in 37.1% of patients - p < 0.001). In patients with GERD and MDAFLD, a significant decrease in serum levels of B vitamins (B1, B3, B6, B9, B12) was found, which correlates negatively with overweight and obesity in these patients.",2025,01,"Wiadomosci lekarskie (Warsaw, Poland : 1960)",Yelyzaveta S Sirchak; Bohdana V Bezushko; Mykhailo M Havrylec; Viktoria M Hadzheha; Habriella E Reyti; Yurii P Balazh; Oleksandr M Kochmar,1296,True,2025-01-01
41124440,Investigation of liver diseases using liver Doppler ultrasound in patients with inflammatory bowel diseases.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), encompassing Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), is characterized by chronic inflammation, which may be associated with hepatic and biliary manifestations such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Despite the high risk of hepatic manifestations among patients with IBD, few studies in Brazil have assessed the frequency of these diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to analyze the prevalence of liver disease by ultrasound in patients with IBD. This was a single-center, cross-sectional study that included patients with IBD who were followed up at an outpatient clinic. The clinical and sociodemographic data, disease activity, biochemical test results, and Doppler liver ultrasonography results were assessed. Descriptive and association tests were used for statistical analyses. A total of 138 patients were included: 64.49% females, mean age 45.55±14.17 years, and body mass index of 26.92±5.07 kg/m2. In total, 63 (45.65%) patients had CD and 75 (54.35%) had UC. Most patients were in either clinical (58.39%) or endoscopic remission (52.55%). Liver ultrasound revealed NAFLD in 58 patients (42.03%), which was classified as mild (36.21%), moderate (46.55%), or severe (17.24%). Seven patients had choledocholithiasis and three had chronic liver disease. Liver disease was associated with changes in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), hematocrit, hemoglobin, and fasting glucose levels. Liver disease is frequent in IBD patients, with NAFLD being the most prevalent. Screening for liver disease in patients with IBD is recommended for early detection and immediate treatment of the alterations, in order to prevent complications and progression to cirrhosis.",2025,01,Brazilian journal of medical and biological research = Revista brasileira de pesquisas medicas e biologica,D N Shintaku; M A Lopes; R F Beraldo; E C S de Oliveira; G S P Herrerias; A C B de Oliveira; J P Baima; W F Barbosa; G F Silva; L Y Sassaki,1753,True,2025-01-01

Classical antidiabetics have little effects on this complication, except pioglitazone that exerts a positive impact but with uncertain safety. Gliptins are almost neutral, whereas glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists showed benefits, the most potent ones being those associated with a greater weight loss such as liraglutide or semaglutide. Gliflozins also reduce hepatic fat content and liver enzymes used as biomarkers of steatosis.

39046173,Effects of Semaglutide on Muscle Structure and Function in the SLIM LIVER Study.,"Semaglutide is highly effective for decreasing weight. Concomitant loss of muscle mass often accompanies weight loss and may have consequences on muscle function. This is a secondary analysis from the SLIM LIVER (Advancing Clinical Therapeutics Globally for HIV/AIDS and Other Infections, ACTG A5371) study, a single-arm study of semaglutide in people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV, PWH) with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases (MASLD). Participants received subcutaneous semaglutide for 24 weeks (titrated to 1 mg/week by week 4). Psoas volume and fat fraction were assessed from liver magnetic resonance imaging, and physical function was assessed by 10-time chair rise test and 4 m gait speed. Mean change from baseline to week 24 was estimated with linear regression modeling. Fifty-one PWH were enrolled (muscle measures n = 46). The mean age was 50 years (standard deviation, 11), body mass index was 35.5 kg/m2 (5.6), 43% were women, 33% Black, and 39% Hispanic/Latino. Psoas muscle volume decreased by 9.3% (95% confidence interval [CI]: -13.4 to -5.2; P < .001) over 24 weeks, but psoas muscle fat did not significantly change (-0.42%; 95% CI: -1.00 to .17; P = .16). Chair rise and gait speed showed nonsignificant improvements of 1.27 seconds (95% CI: -2.7 to .10) and 0.05 m/sec (95% CI: -.01 to .10), respectively (both P > .07). The prevalence of slow gait speed (<1 m/sec) decreased from 63% to 46% (P = .029). In PWH receiving semaglutide for MASLD, despite decreased psoas muscle volume, there was no significant change in physical function, suggesting function was maintained despite significant loss of muscle.

40986866,Effect of Adherence to Oral Semaglutide on Glycemic Control in People With Type 2 Diabetes Treated With Metformin: Protocol for an Open-Label Clinical Trial.,"Treatment adherence by people with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is overall suboptimal, which can hinder glycemic control. Multiple adherence barriers have been identified, such as the dislike and fear of injections. Several of the recommended antidiabetic drugs are available in oral formulations, which may be a good alternative to injection therapy when possible. However, strict dosing instruction could pose adherence barriers; for example, oral semaglutide requires predose and postdose fasting and restricted water intake at dosing time. Currently, oral semaglutide is the only oral glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and has only been available for a few years; therefore, limited knowledge exists on adherence to it. The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of adherence to oral semaglutide dosing instructions on glycemic control in people with T2D who are dysregulated on metformin and optionally a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor and naïve to oral semaglutide. This prospective, noninterventional, open-label, clinical trial with a duration of 12 weeks will be conducted in Denmark. Eligible participants are adults (aged ≥18 years) with dysregulated T2D (hemoglobin A1c of 53-75 mmol/mol) currently treated with metformin and optionally a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor for whom the next natural step in the treatment is to add an antidiabetic drug to the treatment regimen. Potential participants are recruited through announcements on social media and digital mail sent to their official digital mailbox (e-boks). During the trial, 20 participants will be initiated on oral semaglutide and escalated in dosage in accordance with the label. Information on the participants' behavior related to the dosing instructions will be collected using the following devices: a smartwatch to track activity and sleep time, a smart pill bottle to track dosing time, a smart bottle to track time and volume of water intake at dosing time, and a smartphone to take a photo of their breakfast to log time of breakfast. Glycemic control will be assessed using an unblinded continuous glucose monitoring sensor that the participants will wear. Participants are asked to report any cases of nausea or vomiting in terms of time of occurrence, duration, and severity. The primary endpoint is change from baseline to end-of-study time-in-range derived from continuous glucose monitoring data. The first participant visit was in April 2024. Three months of high frequency temporal data on adherence behavior will be collected, despite the relatively few expected participants included. Participants may change their behavior due to awareness of being observed. Regardless, the knowledge gained from this trial might be integrated into a decision support system, providing people with diabetes with guidance on how to increase adherence and potentially improving glycemic control.

38936659,Liver matrin-3 protects mice against hepatic steatosis and stress response via constitutive androstane receptor.,"The prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) continues to rise with the increasing obesity epidemic. Rezdiffra as an activator of a thyroid hormone receptor-beta is the only Food and Drug Administration approved therapy. As such, there is a critical need to improve our understanding of gene expression regulation and signaling transduction in MASLD to develop new therapies. Matrin-3 is a DNA- and RNA-binding protein involved in the pathogenesis of human diseases. Here we examined its previously uncharacterized role in limiting hepatic steatosis and stress response via the constitutive androstane receptor (CAR). Matrin-3 floxed and liver-specific knockout mice were fed either a chow diet or 60 kcal% high-fat diet (HFD) for up to 16 weeks. The mice were euthanized for different analysis including liver histology, lipid levels, and gene expression. Bulk RNA-seq, bulk ATAC-seq, and single-nucleus Multiome were used to examine changes of transcriptome and chromatin accessibility in the liver. Integrative bioinformatics analysis of our data and publicly available datasets and different biochemical assays were performed to identify underlying the molecular mechanisms mediating matrin-3's effects. Liver-tropic adeno-associated virus was used to restore the expression of CAR for lipid, acute phase genes, and histological analysis. Matrin-3 expression is induced in the steatotic livers of mice. Liver-specific matrin-3 deletion exacerbated HFD-induced steatosis, acute phase response, and inflammation in the liver of female mice. The transcriptome and chromatin accessibility were re-programmed in the liver of these mice with signatures indicating that CAR signaling is dysregulated. Mechanistically, matrin-3 interacts with CAR mRNA, and matrin-3 deficiency promotes CAR mRNA degradation. Consequently, matrin-3 deletion impaired CAR signaling by reducing CAR expression. Matrin-3 levels positively correlate with CAR expression in human livers. Ces2a and Il1r1 were identified as new target genes of CAR. Interestingly, we found that CAR discords with the expression of its target genes including Cyp2b10 and Ces2a in response to HFD, indicating CAR signaling is dysregulated by HFD despite increased CAR expression. Dysregulated CAR signaling upon matrin-3 deficiency reduced Ces2a and de-repressed Il1r1 expression. CAR restoration partially abrogated the dysregulated gene expression, exacerbated hepatic steatosis, acute phase response, and inflammation in liver-specific matrin-3 knockout mice fed a HFD. Our findings demonstrate that matrin-3 is a key upstream regulator maintaining CAR signaling upon metabolic stress, and the matrin-3-CAR axis limits hepatic steatosis and stress response signaling that may give insights for therapeutic intervention.",2024,Aug,Molecular metabolism,Xiao Cheng; Vijaya Bhaskar Baki; Matthew Moran; Baolong Liu; Jiujiu Yu; Miaoyun Zhao; Qingsheng Li; Jean-Jack Riethoven; Channabasavaiah B Gurumurth; Edward N Harris; Xinghui Sun,2814,True,2024-08-01

41139758,Sanren Decoction Ameliorates Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease by Protecting Mitochondrial Function.,"To evaluate the effects of Sanren Decoction (SRD) on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) induced by high-fat diet (HFD) based on the protective effect of hepatocyte mitochondrial function. Thirty-six male C57BL/6 mice were randomly assigned to 4 groups using stratified sampling based on body weight, including control, HFD, low-dose (10.09 g/kg) and high-dose (20.18 g/kg) SRD groups (n=9). MASLD model was induced in mice via a 16-week HFD. Liver histopathology was assessed using haematoxylin and eosin (HE) and Oil red O staining, while hepatic triglycerides (TG), serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), fasting blood glucose (FBG), and fasting serum insulin levels were measured using commercial kits. Hepaticmetabolic profiling were analyzed and differential metabolite analysis was performed using partial least squares discriminant analysis and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways. Mitochondrial microstructure was assessed by electron microscopy. The protein expressions of respiratory chain complexes I-V were determined by Western blot analysis, while the activities of complexes I and II were measured using commercial kits. In the HFD-induced MASLD model, 4-week SRD treatment improved hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning (P<0.05). High-dose SRD treatment significantly reduced hepatic TG, ALT levels, and improved insulin sensitivity (both P<0.05). Low-dose SRD significantly reduced hepatic TG and FBG (P<0.05). Metabolomic analysis showed that differential liver metabolites were enriched in tricarboxylic acid cycle (TAC) pathway in mice of high-dose SRD and HFD groups. Electron microscopy showed that high-dose SRD improved mitochondrial morphology and enhanced adenosine triphosphate production and fatty acid oxidation activity (both P<0.05). Additionally, high-dose SRD significantly decreased the contents of hydrogen peroxide and malondialdehyde in liver tissue and increased the content of superoxide dismutase (both P<0.05). Treatment with high-dose SRD resulted in a significant increase in both protein expression and activity of mitochondrial complex II. Additionally, high-dose SRD enhanced the protein expression of mitochondrial complex I (both P<0.05). SRD exhibited hepatoprotective effects in MASLD, improving liver morphology, metabolism, and mitochondrial function, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic strategy for MASLD.",2025,Oct,Chinese journal of integrative medicine,Yi-Xiao Yin; Yi-Yang Hu; Jing-Jing Wang; Hao Tang; Yi Fang; Xue Jiang; Qin Feng; Yu Zhao; Xin Xin; Jing-Hua Peng,2429,True,2025-10-01

Db/db mice were divided into model control, Sema alone, and Sema + HIIT groups, with db/m mice as controls. Sema (0.1 mg/kg/week) was administered subcutaneously, and the control group was subcutaneously injected with the same volume of distilled water. Engaging in HIIT swimming occurred for five consecutive days weekly. Weekly fasting plasma glucose (FPG), body mass, and food intake were assessed. After 8 weeks, blood/liver tissues were analyzed; liver metabolomics used LC-MS. Following an 8-week intervention, it was determined that the weight loss efficacy of Sema alone was suboptimal. The lowering of FPG did not differ significantly between the Sema alone and the combined intervention groups. The combined treatment demonstrated superior efficacy compared with Sema alone in enhancing liver weight, liver index, food intake, TG, TC, hepatic TG, and liver injury biomarkers (AST, ALT; P < 0.05). Histological findings indicated that the combination intervention markedly decreased fat vacuoles and inflammatory infiltration in hepatocytes (P < 0.001). A total of 721 differential metabolites were identified after the combined intervention, with primary alterations in amino acids and their derivatives, lipids, energy metabolism, and bile acids, encompassing key pathways such as the TCA cycle, amino acid metabolism, and bile acid metabolism.

39469553,Effects of weight loss from oral semaglutide administration on cardiometabolic risk factors in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective analysis using propensity score matching.,"Obesity is increasingly being recognized as a chronic disease that exacerbates type 2 diabetes and its related complications. Oral semaglutide, a novel glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, has demonstrated efficacy in weight loss and diabetes control in Western populations. However, in real-world clinical practice, its effectiveness in Japanese patients, who typically exhibit a leaner phenotype and unique genetic susceptibilities affecting insulin secretion, remains unclear. We retrospectively evaluated the electronic medical records of 313 patients treated with oral semaglutide and 11,239 untreated controls at the Keio University School of Medicine. We performed propensity score matching to adjust for covariates, including age, sex, height, weight, blood pressure, blood test data, medications, and compared the cardiometabolic risk factors, including HbA1c, blood pressure, lipids, and liver function 180 days post-treatment, of both patient groups. We conducted a subgroup analysis for patients who achieved ≥ 3% weight loss. After propensity score matching, the semaglutide group demonstrated significantly better outcomes for HbA1c reduction and weight loss and improvements in systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), and liver function than the control group. Subgroup analysis of patients with ≥ 3% weight loss revealed superior HbA1c improvements in the semaglutide group; however, no significant differences in other metabolic parameters, such as SBP, LDL-C, and liver function, were observed. Oral semaglutide effectively improved metabolic markers in Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes, similar to that in Western populations. Weight loss itself was suggested to significantly contribute to blood pressure, lipid levels, and liver function changes.

This study aimed to investigate the association between circulating amino acid profiles and NAFLD screened by the Fatty Liver Index (FLI) and Framingham Steatosis Index (FSI) among Iranian population 50years and over. This cross-sectional study included 1642 participants aged ≥ 50years from Bushehr Elderly Health Program. Amino acid levels were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). FLI and FSI were calculated as surrogate markers for NAFLD. Logistic regression and principal component analysis (PCA) were employed to assess associations between individual and clustered amino acid patterns and NAFLD indices, adjusting for confounders such as age, sex, BMI, diabetes, lipid profile, and inflammation markers. The study included 1642 people (mean age62.24 ± 8.18 years). Higher levels of branched-chain, amino acids leucine (FSI: OR = 1.0083;FLI: OR = 1.0102) and valine (FSI: OR = 1.0064) and aromatic amino acids, tyrosine (FSI: OR = 1.0101;FLI: OR = 1.0211), phenylalanine (FLI: OR = 1.0131), tryptophan (FLI: OR = 1.0072), along with alanine (FSI: OR = 1.0039;FLI: OR = 1.0034) and glutamic acid (FSI: OR = 1.0032;FLI: OR = 1.0085), were positively associated with increased FLI and FSI scores (FDR < 0.05).

41147020,Relative Impact of GLP-1 Agonist Use on Microvascular Versus Macrovascular Complications.,"Diabetes and obesity contribute to vascular complications. The effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) on microvascular and macrovascular outcomes in the general population remain less well understood. To compare the adjusted odds of microvascular and macrovascular complications among adults in the United States (US) using GLP-1 RAs. We conducted a survey-weighted logistic regression analysis using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2011-2018. Microvascular complications were defined as albuminuria or diabetic retinopathy, while macrovascular complications included myocardial infarction, stroke, or coronary artery disease. Models adjusted for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors.  In the adjusted models, the use of GLP-1 RA was linked to increased odds of microvascular complications (OR 2.29, 95% CI 1.05-4.97, p=0.037). No significant association was observed with macrovascular complications (OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.65-2.51, p=0.478). Established risk factors, including older age, higher BMI, lower income, and smoking, were independently associated with higher odds of vascular complications. The use of GLP-1 RAs was linked to increased odds of microvascular complications following adjustment for the confounders, even as no significant association was reported with macrovascular complications. This possibly reflects confounding through indication, given that such medications/agents are mainly prescribed to persons with either longer duration or increasingly severe diabetes. These findings indicate the need for longitudinal studies to explain the temporal correlations between the use of GLP-1 RA and complication risk.",2025,Oct,Cureus,Efeturi M Okorigba; Kehinde H Jinadu; Oto-Obong J Utuk; Akinyemi Akinwumiju; Olasunkanmi A Kolawole; Fatimot Disu; Victor Sosu,1708,True,2025-10-01
40828048,Multiparametric MRI Evaluation of Liver Fat and Iron after Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor and Glucagon Receptor Dual-Agonist Treatment in a High-Fat Diet-induced Mouse Model.,"Background Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and glucagon receptor (GCGR) dual agonist, along with GLP-1R monoagonist, show promise in treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Liver fat and iron content are important surrogate markers for disease assessment. However, it remains unclear whether dual agonists provide superior therapeutic benefit over monoagonists for hepatic fat and iron regulation. Purpose To evaluate whether a GLP-1R/GCGR dual agonist offers greater therapeutic efficacy in reducing hepatic fat and iron content compared with a GLP-1R monoagonist in a high-fat diet mouse model using quantitative 9.4-T MRI. Materials and Methods Forty-two male mice were fed a high-fat diet for 13 weeks and then were treated subcutaneously with GLP-1R/GCGR dual agonist (mazdutide), GLP-1R monoagonist (semaglutide), or phosphate-buffered saline (control) every 3 days for 4 weeks. The control group included 14 age-matched male mice that received a standard chow diet and phosphate-buffered saline treatment. MRI scans and tissue samples were obtained at baseline and at 1 and 4 weeks after treatment. MRI-derived proton density fat fraction (PDFF), quantifying hepatic fat content, and R2*, quantifying hepatic iron content, were derived with a 9.4-T MRI scanner. Reductions in PDFF and R2* were compared among the groups using analysis of covariance and Student",2025,Aug,Radiology,Huimin Xia; Yuqin Min; Yuhua Wang; Siyu Gao; Hailing Wang; Fuhua Yan; Ruixin Liu; Jiqiu Wang; Xuejiang Gu; Tingting Bo,1414,True,2025-08-01

41172806,Curcumin ameliorates high-glucose-induced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells via AMPK activation and mTOR suppression.,"A typical consequence of diabetes is diabetes-associated non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (D-NAFLD), which is defined by excessive hepatic lipid buildup brought on by insulin resistance and chronic hyperglycemia. In this study, we established a high-glucose-induced HepG2 cell model to mimic the diabetic hepatic environment and examine how curcumin protects against liver fat accumulation caused by high blood sugar. Oil Red O staining and Immunoblotting analysis demonstrated that curcumin significantly reduced lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells under high-glucose conditions. To explore the underlying molecular mechanisms, we applied bioinformatic analysis in diabetic patients with and without NAFLD and identified the AMPK/mTOR pathway as a critical regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism. Additionally, molecular docking studies showed that curcumin has a high affinity for binding to AMPK (-8.1 kcal/mol). Western blot analysis confirmed that curcumin alleviates lipid accumulation via AMPK activation and mTOR signaling inhibition. To verify the essential role of AMPK in this process, we employed an AMPK inhibitor, which abolished curcumin's protective effects. These findings indicate that curcumin attenuates hyperglycemia-induced hepatic steatosis via AMPK activation and mTOR suppression, highlighting its potential therapeutic value in the treatment of D-NAFLD.",2025,Oct,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Min Chen; Jialin Yao; Zuoli Liu,1378,True,2025-10-01

Despite its pathogenic potential, it is frequently misidentified as Klebsiella pneumoniae due to their close genetic and phenotypic similarities, leading to diagnostic challenges and potential implications for treatment and epidemiological surveillance. This study addresses a critical gap in our understanding of K. quasipneumoniae by applying high-resolution genomic tools to distinguish it from its more well-characterized K. pneumoniae, assessed their AMR profiles and evaluate the limitation of conventional identification methods. Whole genome of a gram-negative K. quasipneumoniae (Klebsiella ST1699) bacterium found in an edible fish bought from a retail market in Assam, India. Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) using the Illumina sequencing and species identification by Mash Screen confirmed the authenticity of K. quasipneumoniae. We assembled the 5.21 Mb complete genome of Klebsiella ST1699 and harboured several Antimicrobial Resistance Genes (ARGs) viz., blaLAP-2, blaOKP-B-1, fosA, tet(A), Sul2, dfrA14. OqxA and OqxB, and identified as a novel sequence type 1699 K. quasipneumoniae (ST 1699) from the edible fish in the retail market, Assam, India. We also performed comparative genome analysis with 6 other strains of K. quasipneumoniae genome sequences in the NCBI database. K. quasipneumoniae represents a clinically relevant and underrecognized pathogen with significant antimicrobial resistance. Improved molecular diagnostics are essential for accurate identification and effective infection control. Misidentification may contribute to underreporting and inappropriate therapeutic strategies, underscoring the need for heightened awareness and surveillance.

41053738,Real-world cardiovascular effectiveness of sustained glucagon-like peptide 1 GLP-1 receptor agonist usage in type 2 diabetes.,"Cardiovascular outcome trials have shown that glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) reduce cardiovascular event rates more effectively than placebo and in patients with type 2 diabetes at increased cardiovascular risk. However, the generalizability of these findings to real-world settings remains uncertain. This study aimed to evaluate the real-world cardiovascular effectiveness of sustained GLP1-RA use compared to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) over 3.5 years. Using Danish nationwide registries, we emulated a target trial to assess the real-world effectiveness of GLP1-RAs in a population of individuals with type 2 diabetes mirroring the inclusion and exclusion criteria from the Liraglutide Effect and Action in Diabetes: Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcome Results (LEADER) trial. The study period was 2012-2022. Outcomes included the composite of myocardial infarction, stroke, and cardiovascular mortality (3P-MACE), as well as each component individually, alongside all-cause mortality, heart failure, angina pectoris, and revascularization. Longitudinal Targeted Minimum Loss-based Estimation, a method that adjusts for both baseline and time-varying confounding, was used to estimate absolute risks of cardiovascular outcomes under sustained use of GLP1-RA and DPP 4i (active comparator), adjusting for baseline and time-varying confounding. We included 6,681 people initiating GLP1-RA and 19,072 initiating DPP-4i. Accounting for baseline and time-varying confounding, sustained GLP1-RA use showed a 2.5% (95% CI 0.8-4.1%) risk reduction of 3P-MACEover 3.5 years. Risk reductions for cardiovascular mortality, all-cause mortality, heart failure, and unstable angina pectoris were 2.3% (95% CI 1.4-3.1%), 2.5% (95% CI 0.7-4.3%), 0.9% (95% CI 0.01-1.8%), and 0.7% (95% CI 0.01-1.3%), respectively. No significant differences were observed for myocardial infarction, stroke, or revascularization with risk differences of 0.1% (95% CI -1.0 to 0.8%), 0.8% (95% CI -0.2 to 1.7%), and 0.2% (95% CI -0.7-1.1%), respectively.

41056021,"Decoding the triglyceride-glucose index in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: integrative insights from mendelian randomization, cross-tissue transcriptomics, and spatial multi-omics.","The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, an insulin resistance marker linked to the progression of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), underscores the redox imbalance-mediated crosstalk between MASLD and cardiovascular-liver-metabolic health (CLMH), although its causal mechanisms and molecular drivers remain unresolved. We employed a multi-omics framework to integrate Mendelian randomization (MR) and transcriptome-wide association studies (TWAS). MR leveraged 192 genome-wide significant SNPs for TyG from the UK Biobank, employing inverse-variance weighted (IVW) and generalized summary-data MR (GSMR). Transcriptomic integration utilized four approaches: Multi-marker Analysis of GenoMic Annotation (MAGMA) for gene-set enrichment; Joint-Tissue Imputation PrediXcan (JTI-PrediXcan) for tissue-specific expression; Sparse Multi-Tissue Imputation Xcan (SMulTiXcan) for cross-tissue meta-analysis; and Fine-mapping of Causal Gene Sets (FOCUS) for Bayesian fine-mapping. Co-morbid genes were validated using Functional Summary-based Imputation (FUSION) and prioritized based on the Polygenic Priority Score (PoPS). Single-cell spatial transcriptomics (sc-ST) in embryonic mice (E16.5) mapped tissue-specific expression via genetically informed spatial mapping (gsMap). MR analysis demonstrated a causal effect of TyG on MASLD risk (IVW: odds ratio [OR] = 1.58, 95%CI = 1.04-2.38, P = 0.030; GSMR: OR = 1.43, 95% CI = 1.27-1.61, P = 5.20 × 10-9). TWAS identified 12 co-morbid genes (C2orf16/SPATA31H1, FNDC4, GCKR, GMIP, HAPLN4, LPAR2, MAU2, MEF2B, NDUFA13, NRBP1, TM6SF2, ZNF513). Independent validation using the FUSION framework confirmed nine TyG-MASLD comorbid genes with genome-wide significant false discovery rate-adjusted associations. Notably, TM6SF2 (TyG-PoPS = 7.2491) and GCKR (TyG-PoPS = 6.7102) showed strong positive associations in TyG, while NDUFA13 exhibited negative scores in MASLD (PoPS = - 0.5028). Spatial mapping revealed conserved enrichment of APOA1, APOB, and APOC4 (sc-ST P<0.001) in murine liver and vascular tissues.

No previous study has assessed within-individual liver stiffness variation from two rib spaces in individuals with metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We evaluated within-individual LSM variation according to body weight classification and its clinical implication. From October 2019 to March 2024, VCTE was performed on MASLD patients or those at high risk, in accordance with FibroScan guidelines. The LSMs were categorized into stages: <5 kPa (stage 0), 5-7.99 kPa (stage 1), 8-9.99 kPa (stage 2), 10-13.99 kPa (stage 3), and 14+ kPa (stage 4). Measurements with 10 values and IQR/median ≤ 0.30 were included, using SPSS V25.0 for analysis. Among 1107 subjects (age 54.4 ± 13.9 years, 56.9% female), 7.7% were normal weight, 20.7% overweight, 28.9% class 1 obesity, 21.3% class 2 obesity, and 21.2% class 3 obesity. Significant within-individual variation was noted: 67% (0-2 kPa) variation, 23.4% (2.1-6 kPa), and 10% (≥6.1 kPa). Class 3 obese individuals had the maximum variation. Comparing the group-average of LSM at each ICS site showed that 95% of individuals were within one fibrosis stage. While LSM group-averages at different rib sites provides reliable fibrosis staging, significant within-individual variability exists especially in class 3 obesity.

41072817,Antidepressants and the endogenous opioid system.,"The endogenous opioid system consists of three different G protein-coupled receptors, named mu-, delta- and kappa-opioid receptors (MOR, DOR, and KOR, respectively). These receptors are activated by over 20 distinct peptides produced from proenkephalin, prodynorphin, and proopiomelanocortin. The endogenous opioid system contributes to many important functions including analgesia, reward, and regulation of mood. A growing body of evidence links the opioid system with major depressive disorder. One strong line of evidence is that two different widely used antidepressants, tianeptine and ketamine, both interact with MOR; tianeptine as a full agonist, and ketamine as a positive allosteric modulator. Both of these drugs produce clinical antidepressant effects within hours or days. Buprenorphine, a partial MOR agonist commonly used for treating opioid use disorder, also shows promise as a rapid-acting antidepressant. While the conventional view is that major depressive disorder is caused by an imbalance of biogenic amine neurotransmitters, drugs that affect these neurotransmitter systems typically require weeks of dosing before showing antidepressant effects. Chronic antidepressant treatment of mice causes changes in gene expression. Interestingly, proenkephalin is one of the most highly upregulated genes following long-term treatment of mice with fluoxetine, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Taken together, these findings suggest that the opioid system plays an important role in major depressive disorder.

Recent therapies, including Resmetirom, FGF21 analogs, and GLP-1 agonists, have shown promise. This network meta-analysis evaluates their comparative efficacy and safety. A literature search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. Included clinical trials addressed MASLD or MASH with Resmetirom, FGF21 analogs, or GLP-1 agonists. Statistical analyses used a random-effects model, calculating mean differences (MD) and relative risks (RR), with heterogeneity assessed using τ MASH resolution was significantly higher for FGF21 (RR 4.84, 95% CI: 2.59 to 9.03), Resmetirom showed the most significant reduction in MRI-PDFF (MD -18.41, 95% CI: -23.60 to -13.22) and >30% fat reduction (RR 3.56, 95% CI: 2.41 to 5.26). Resmetirom significantly reduced ALT (MD -15.71, 95% CI: -23.30 to -8.13), AST (MD -12.28, 95% CI: -21.07 to -3.49), and GGT (MD -19.56, 95% CI: -34.68 to -4.44). FGF21 and GLP-1 also reduced these markers. Adverse events were significantly higher with Resmetirom (RR 1.47, 95% CI: 1.24 to 1.74), while GLP-1 and FGF21 showed non-significant trends towards increased risk. Resmetirom and FGF21 show promise in treating MASLD and MASH, with Resmetirom particularly effective in reducing liver fat and improving liver enzymes.

A retrospective analysis of a national claims database was performed for patients undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty for osteoarthritis who had an active semaglutide prescription from January 2010 to April 2023. Patients were divided into nonobese (BMI < 30), obese (BMI 30.0 to 39.9), and morbidly obese (BMI ≥ 40) groups. Semaglutide users were propensity score matched to nonusers, yielding nonobese (7,402 versus 36,884), obese (4,034 versus 20,134), and morbidly obese (2,383 versus 11,853). Outcomes included 90-day medical complications, 90-day readmissions, and 90-day and 2-year implant-related complications. Univariate and multivariate regressions compared outcomes within BMI groups. In the nonobese group, semaglutide users had significantly lower odds of deep vein thrombosis (odds ratio (OR) 0.68; 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.57 to 0.81; P < 0.001), pulmonary embolism (OR 0.49; 95% CI 0.34 to 0.70; P < 0.001), and pneumonia (OR 0.69; 95% CI 0.53 to 0.89; P = 0.004).

Understanding the factors that underpin CircS is essential. This study primarily aims to examine the association between hypothyroidism and CircS in adults. A secondary analysis compares this association with that between hypothyroidism and Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). Additionally, the dose-response relationship between serum free thyroxine (FT4) levels and CircS probability is explored. This cross-sectional study includes 4050 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) participants (2007-2012). Hypothyroidism was classified into (1) drug-managed, (2) non-drug-managed (NDM) primary, and (3) NDM central hypothyroidism, based on self-reported medication use and serum TSH/FT4 levels. CircS was defined as having ≥5 of its eight components, including MetS criteria, depression, short sleep, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Our results showed that hypothyroidism was significantly associated with CircS (OR: 1.58, 95% CI 1.26-1.98) and MetS (OR: 1.19, 95% CI 1.01-1.42). An inverse, non-linear relationship between serum FT4 levels and the probability of CircS was observed. The results underscore a significant association between hypothyroidism and CircS and MetS, with FT4 levels inversely related to CircS probability.

39889206,Focused Recommendations for the Management of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) by Advanced Practice Providers in the United States.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has become the dominant cause of liver disease in the United States. With the growing burden of this disease in gastroenterology practices, the identification and treatment of those at risk of developing adverse outcomes (cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, or liver-related death) has become urgent. In recent years, the development of noninvasive tests (NITs) to identify ""at-risk MASH"" patients have provided cost-effective algorithms to identify these patients. Although treatment has historically been limited to lifestyle modification, recent FDA approval of resmetirom for noncirrhosis MASH with stages 2 and 3 fibrosis has provided a new opportunity in the United States to provide these patients with novel treatment options. Other new effective treatment regimens are on the horizon. Given that gastroenterology and hepatology practices in the United States heavily rely on advanced practice providers (APPs) to manage patients with MASLD, the APP Committee of the Global NASH/MASH Council has curated the essentials of day-to-day MASH management for our busy gastrohepatology providers and their APP colleagues. The goal of this document is to equip and mobilize more GI providers with the requisite competencies for the management of at-risk MASH, given the rapidly evolving MASH treatment landscape.",2025,Apr,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,Brian P Lam; Jessica Bartholomew; Sherona Bau; HoChong Gilles; Andrea Keller; Ann Moore; Khalil Nader; Lisa Richards; Linda Henry; Zobair M Younossi,1370,True,2025-04-01

However, its use has sparked moral debates, with critics dismissing it as a mere ""shortcut"" compared to traditional methods like diet and exercise. This study investigates how weight loss method-Ozempic, diet/exercise, or a combination of both-impacts perceptions of effort, praiseworthiness, and identity/value change. We used a contrastive vignette technique in two experiments (combined N = 1041, demographically representative for age, sex, and ethnicity) to study the attitudes of US participants toward a fictional character who lost 50 pounds through one of the three described methods. Weight loss through diet/exercise alone was deemed most effortful and most praiseworthy, whereas Ozempic use, even when combined with diet/exercise, was rated as both less effortful and less praiseworthy than diet/exercise alone. Ozempic use with no mention of diet/exercise was rated as least effortful and least praiseworthy. Compared to diet and exercise alone, Ozempic use also decreased perceptions that the individual had really changed as a person, or experienced a change in their underlying values.

This study aimed to quantify the cardiorenal benefits of combination regimens with GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, and/or finerenone versus corresponding monotherapies. MEDLINE and Embase were systematically searched, yielding four post hoc analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and ten observational studies that met prespecified inclusion criteria. Among RCTs, a random-effects meta-regression was performed to assess whether the effect of GLP-1RAs on cardiorenal outcomes differed based on baseline SGLT2i use. Additionally, for observational studies, random-effects meta-analyses were performed to estimate the effect of combination therapy versus monotherapy on the risk of cardiorenal outcomes. Across RCTs, p for interaction was > 0.05 for major adverse cardiac events (MACE) (p = 0.730), cardiovascular (CV) mortality (p = 0.889), non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI) (p = 0.237), non-fatal stroke (p = 0.696), all-cause mortality (p = 0.682), heart failure (HF) hospitalization (p = 0.257), and renal composite outcome (p = 0.890), supporting that GLP-1RAs result in a consistent reduction in outcomes irrespective of baseline SGLT2i use. In observational trials, compared to SGLT2i monotherapy, GLP-1RA and SGLT2i combination therapy significantly reduced MACE (HR 0.59, 95% CI 0.47-0.75), MI (HR 0.73, 95% CI 0.61-0.88), stroke (HR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.97), all-cause mortality (HR 0.57, 95% CI 0.48-0.67), and HF hospitalization/events (HR 0.71, 95% CI 0.59-0.86). Compared to GLP-1RA monotherapy, SGLT2i and GLP-1RA combination therapy significantly reduced CV mortality (HR 0.35, 95% CI 0.15-0.81), MI (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.88-0.97), stroke (HR 0.92, 95% CI 0.88-0.96), all-cause mortality (HR 0.59, 95% 0.49-0.70), HF hospitalization/events (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.81-0.88), and serious renal events (HR 0.43, 95% CI 0.23-0.80). Compared to either SGLT2i or finerenone monotherapy, SGLT2i and finerenone combination therapy significantly reduced all-cause mortality and major adverse kidney events. Combination therapy with GLP-1RA, SGLT2i, or finerenone confers cardiorenal protection beyond monotherapy in T2D, as supported by concordant evidence from RCTs and large real-world cohorts.

We screened 72 UK adult patients with ALMS and offered treatment to 34 patients meeting one of the following criteria: body mass index of 25 kg/m In total, 30 patients, with a mean age of 31 ± 11 years and a male to-female ratio of 2:1, completed 6 months of treatment with GLP-1 RAs either in the form of semaglutide or exenatide. On average, treatment with GLP-1 RAs reduced body weight by 5.4 ± 1.7 (95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6-7) kg and HbA1c by 12 ± 3.3 (95% CI 8.7-15.3) mmol/mol, equating to 6% weight loss (P < .01) and 1.1% absolute reduction in HbA1c (P < .01). Significant improvements were also observed in serum total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol and alanine aminotransferase. The improvement of metabolic variables in our cohort of monogenic syndromic obesity was comparable with data for polygenic obesity, irrespective of weight loss.

40248984,Model-Based Meta-Analysis of the Relationship Between Pioglitazone and Histological Outcomes in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis Patients.,"Given the high prevalence of the population who have metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), interest is growing in MASH-targeted treatments. However, currently, there has been only one regulatory approved drug for MASH (Rezdiffra). Pioglitazone, a commonly used type 2 diabetes mellitus drug, is currently used off-label for the treatment of MASH. Our study aimed to perform a model-based meta-analysis to quantitatively examine the efficacy of pioglitazone in improving histological parameters and liver enzymes in patients with MASH. A comprehensive search was performed in Pubmed and clinicaltrials.gov. We collected histological outcomes (including steatosis, inflammation, ballooning, and fibrosis) and liver enzyme data. Due to sparse data, the gathered histological outcomes were used to generate virtual data. Next, model development for the virtual histological dataset was performed using a logistic model. In addition, Weibull and exponential models were tested to find the best fit for liver enzyme data. Model evaluations were carried out by visual predictive check, bootstrap method, and stacked bar plot. Eight studies with 540 patients were included. A logit model was used to analyze four outcomes. The results showed that using pioglitazone improved all four histological parameters. These effects are dose- and time-dependent under the Emax-time model for steatosis and ballooning, and under the linear relationship for inflammation and fibrosis. For liver enzymes, the Weibull model fitted well for both ALT and AST data. In conclusion, the developed models of pioglitazone may serve as a benchmark to assess the effectiveness of novel MASH-targeted treatments.",2025,Apr,CPT: pharmacometrics & systems pharmacology,Quyen Thi Tran; Tham Thi Bui; Lien Thi Ngo; Bo Ram Yang; In-Hwan Baek; Van Hung Nguyen; Kyung Ae Lee; Hwi-Yeol Yun; Jung-Woo Chae; Soyoung Lee; Jae Hyun Kim; Woojin Jung,1700,True,2025-04-01
41074143,Roles of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists in immune cell biology and autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a gut-derived hormone essential for maintaining glucose homeostasis through multiple physiological pathways: triggering insulin release, inhibiting glucagon secretion, delaying gastric emptying, enhancing feelings of fullness, and suppressing appetite. Since GLP-1 is prone to degradation by dipeptidyl peptidase 4, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been developed to surmount this degradation challenge. At present, GLP-1RAs have become highly effective treatments for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity. Beyond their well-established benefits for blood sugar regulation and weight control, GLP-1RAs also exhibit various biological activities associated with both insulinotropic effects and immunoregulation. These effects have been demonstrated through in vitro studies, preclinical models, and clinical observations. This review aims to explore the effects of GLP-1R signaling on various immune cells and evaluate the therapeutic potential of GLP-1RAs in autoimmune and autoinflammatory diseases, including psoriasis, inflammatory bowel diseases, rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, multiple sclerosis, Sjögren's syndrome, and systemic lupus erythematosus.",2025,Oct,Cell & bioscience,Sihui Deng; Zeyu Chen; Yuling Shi,1206,True,2025-10-01

This study aims to guide the prevention and diagnosis of MAFLD by analysing its risk factors within the adult population from Suzhong Region, China. This was a cross-sectional study. The study was conducted at the Health Management Department of Northern Jiangsu People's Hospital. A total of 49 776 asymptomatic Chinese participants (54.24% men) were enrolled. Hepatic ultrasonography was performed to diagnose MAFLD based on the latest diagnostic criteria. The relevant blood routine and biochemical indicators were collected. Among 49 776 participants, the prevalence of MAFLD was 29.89% (14 877/49 776). The results of restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis showed a nonlinear relationship between age and MAFLD prevalence. As age increased, the overall trend of age in relation to MAFLD prevalence was initially increasing and then decreasing in the total study population and in males. In contrast, the overall trend of age in relation to MAFLD prevalence in females was initially increasing and then levelling off. The study found that age, body mass index (BMI), red blood cell (RBC) count, white blood cell (WBC) count, fasting blood glucose, albumin, total bilirubin, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), uric acid, triglycerides (TG) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were risk factors for MAFLD in adults, while aspartate aminotransferase, direct bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were protective factors (p<0.05). Among these, BMI, ALT, TG, triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) and Atherogenic Index of Plasma (AIP) had excellent predictive value for the occurrence of MAFLD in adults (area under the curve was 0.834, 0.803, 0.809, 0.822, 0.880 and 0.824, respectively). The clinical applicability of important feature variables was assessed using decision curve analysis curves and confusion matrix, and the results showed that TyG-BMI had the highest clinical diagnostic and decision-making benefits. The occurrence of MAFLD has a nonlinear relationship with age and the trend of this relationship varies significantly between males and females.

We designed and constructed several dual receptor agonists with different receptor potency ratios using Fc fusion protein technology. The long-term effects of the candidates on body weight and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) were evaluated in diet-induced obese (DIO) model mice, high-fat diet (HFD)-ob/ob mice and AMLN diet-induced MASLD mice. Repeat dose toxicity assays were performed to investigate the safety profile of the candidate (HEC-C070) in Sprague Dawley (SD) rats. The high GCG receptor (GCGR) selectivity of HEC-C046 makes it more prominent than other compounds for weight loss and most MASLD parameters but may lead to safety concerns. The weight change of HEC-C052 with the lowest GCG agonism was inferior to that of selective GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) semaglutide in DIO model mice. The GLP-1R selectivity of HEC-C070 with moderate GCG agonism has a significant effect on weight loss and liver function in obese mice, and its lowest observed adverse effect level (LOAEL) was 30 nmol/kg in the repeat dose toxicity study. We compared the potential of the Fc fusion protein GLP-1/GCG dual receptor agonists with different receptor selectivity to provide the setting for future GLP-1/GCG dual receptor agonists to treat obesity and MASLD.",2024,May,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,Peng Jiang; Ying Zeng; Wen Yang; Lijia Li; Linjun Zhou; Lin Xiao; Yong Li; Baohua Gu; Xiaoping Li; Jing Li; Wenjia Li; Linfeng Guo,1609,True,2024-05-01

This was a phase IIa, randomized, active-comparator-controlled, parallel-group, open-label study. A magnetic resonance imaging-estimated proton density fat fraction assessment was performed to determine LFC at screening and Week 24. Participants with an LFC of ≥10% at screening were randomized 1:1 to efinopegdutide 10 mg or semaglutide 1 mg, both administered subcutaneously once weekly for 24 weeks. Participants were stratified according to the concurrent diagnosis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Both drugs were titrated to the target dose over an 8-week time period. The primary efficacy endpoint was relative reduction from baseline in LFC (%) after 24 weeks of treatment. Among 145 randomized participants (efinopegdutide n = 72, semaglutide n = 73), 33.1% had T2DM. At baseline, mean BMI was 34.3 kg/m In patients with NAFLD, treatment with efinopegdutide 10 mg weekly led to a significantly greater reduction in LFC than semaglutide 1 mg weekly.

Secondary outcomes included changes in lipid profile, renal and liver markers, blood pressure, and HbA1c. All three agents led to significant weight loss. Tirzepatide showed the greatest reduction of weight loss (10.9%; p < 0.001), followed by semaglutide (9.9%; p < 0.001) and liraglutide (7.1%; p < 0.001). Dose-dependent reductions were observed for tirzepatide and semaglutide. Tirzepatide, semaglutide and liraglutide modestly reduced HbA1c by 0.65% (p = 0.004), 0.33% (p = 0.034) and 0.23% (p = 0.017), respectively. LDL-cholesterol was reduced by semaglutide (p = 0.05) and liraglutide (p = 0.02), and liraglutide also lowered the urine albumin-to-creatinine ratio (p = 0.007).

However, variations in prescribing practices and potential adverse drug events (ADEs) necessitate standardized prescription review protocols to ensure medication safety and efficacy. This study aimed to develop and implement GLP-1RA prescription review rules through a multidisciplinary information pharmacist team, evaluate their impact on prescription rationality, and identify ADE risk signals using real-world data, thereby promoting rational clinical medication use and ensuring patient safety. A multidisciplinary information pharmacist team was established at a tertiary hospital to develop GLP-1RA prescription review protocols. China-approved GLP-1RA formulations and their clinical parameters were systematically reviewed to establish standardized prescribing criteria, including indications, dosing, and safety considerations. Adverse drug events were analyzed using FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data (2018-2023) to identify risk patterns. A dual review system integrating prospective prescription screening and retrospective evaluation was implemented. The intervention's efficacy was evaluated by comparing prescription approval rates pre- (2022) and post-implementation (2023). The GLP-1RA audit rules represented by liraglutide and semaglutide were successfully created, as well as their potential adverse event signals were successfully obtained. The process of prescription review and medication monitoring enabled them to be put into clinical practice. After the rules were put in place in 2023, the pass rates of GLP-1RA prescriptions significantly improved, and the rationalization of these prescriptions was also notably enhanced compared to the same period in 2022 (p < 0.001).

41094515,Perilipins: key targets for regulating lipid metabolism and alleviating abnormal lipid metabolism through exercise.,"The deposition of ectopic lipids and resulting insulin resistance (IR) are strongly linked to a high risk of many chronic metabolic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Perilipin family proteins (PLINs), which flexibly regulate the storage and release of lipids contained in lipid droplets in tissues, as well as the connection between lipid droplets and mitochondria, enabling fatty acids to enter mitochondria for β-oxidation. This review provides an updated consolidation of the evolving role of PLINs in lipid metabolism. Exercise, effective in activating lipolysis in tissues, alleviates the deposition of ectopic lipids and IR. Exercise-induced metabolic adaptations can, in turn, modulate PLIN expression in multiple tissues. However, there are still some controversies regarding the changes in PLINs in different tissues during exercise and their role in regulating lipid metabolism. We comprehensively discuss the roles of PLINs in metabolically active tissues (the adipose tissue, liver, and skeletal muscle), the effect of exercise on PLIN expression, and the role of PLIN in reducing ectopic fat deposition during exercise. The interplay between PLIN expression, lipid dynamics, and metabolic states such as exercise, fasting, and obesity is consolidated to ascertain the importance of PLINs in regulating lipid metabolism. By synthesizing fragmented insights on PLINs into a coherent narrative, we attempted to connect PLIN function with exercise physiology and metabolic diseases and suggest potential avenues for research, diagnosis, and therapy.",2025,Oct,Diabetology & metabolic syndrome,Yan-Jun Niu; Jing-Jing Liu; Jing-Hua Zhang; Shi-Qi Lu; Ke Wang; Zheng Zhu; Zhen-Bo Cao,1644,True,2025-10-01
41086922,Mitochondrial MFN2 integrates the function of multiple organelles to regulate metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: mechanisms and therapeutic insights.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) encompasses a wide spectrum of liver diseases with increasing global prevalence. Its hallmarks include aberrant lipid accumulation and inflammation, which lead to liver fibrosis. The efficacious therapies for treating MASLD are limited, and the response rates to antifibrotic drugs are moderate. Understanding the novel mechanisms that regulate the progression of MASLD enables the discovery of drugs with higher response rates and safety. Besides the canonical pathogenic pathways, the dysfunctions in the contacts and communication between mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and lipid droplet (LD) causatively drive and promote MASLD. Mitofusin-2 (MFN2) is a mitochondria-bound GTPase that stimulates mitochondrial fusion and is an emerging key factor that suppresses the progression of MASLD and liver fibrosis by maintaining the contact between mitochondria, ER and LD.

41133099,Bile salt hydrolase: a key player in gut microbiota and its implications for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"The rising prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) poses a significant global public health challenge. Bile acids (BAs), synthesized in the liver and further metabolized in the gut, are essential in maintaining host metabolic homeostasis. Bile salt hydrolase (BSH), an enzyme produced by the gut microbiota, catalyzes the hydrolysis of conjugated BAs, thus regulating the balance between primary and secondary BAs. Growing evidence suggests that BSH activity is intricately linked to the pathogenesis of MASLD. This review comprehensively examines the structural and functional properties of BSH enzymes, their distribution among gut microbial communities, and current methodologies for assessing BSH expression and activity. Furthermore, it highlights the alterations in BSH observed in MASLD and explores the potential mechanistic pathways involved, offering a foundation for the development of novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.",2025,01,Microbiome research reports,Weixing Zhao; Huiying Wang; Minghua Zheng; Yan Ni,981,True,2025-01-01

It is designed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic diseases. This study aimed to quantitatively describe the exposure-response (E-R) relationship between efsubaglutide alfa exposure and efficacy and safety endpoints in patients with T2DM and to assess the impact of baseline characteristics on the E-R relationship. An E-R analysis was conducted using data from 465 drug-naïve participants with T2DM in a phase IIb/III trial (YN011-301), which included a 24-week double-blind period followed by a 28-week open-label period. Participants received once-weekly subcutaneous injections of efsubaglutide alfa 1 mg, 2 mg, or 3 mg or placebo. Regression analysis was performed against the steady-state pharmacokinetic exposure, including steady state peak concentration (C The median age was 51.0 years, and the mean baseline glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) was 8.71%. At weeks 24 and 52, reductions in HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, area under the concentration-time curve for glucose during the mixed-meal tolerance test, body weight, waist circumference, and body mass index correlated positively with drug exposure.

38065435,Evaluation of long acting GLP1R/GCGR agonist in a DIO and biopsy-confirmed mouse model of NASH suggest a beneficial role of GLP-1/glucagon agonism in NASH patients.,"The metabolic benefits of GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists on glycemic and weight control are well established as therapy for type 2 diabetes and obesity. Glucagon's ability to increase energy expenditure is well described, and the combination of these mechanisms-of-actions has the potential to further lower hepatic steatosis in metabolic disorders and could therefore be attractive for the treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Here, we have investigated the effects of a dual GLP-1/glucagon receptor agonist NN1177 on hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and inflammation in a preclinical mouse model of NASH. Having observed strong effects on body weight loss in a pilot study with NN1177, we hypothesized that direct engagement of the hepatic glucagon receptor (GCGR) would result in a superior effect on steatosis and other liver related parameters as compared to the GLP-1R agonist semaglutide at equal body weight. Male C57Bl/6 mice were fed a diet high in trans-fat, fructose, and cholesterol (Diet-Induced Obese (DIO)-NASH) for 36 weeks. Following randomization based on the degree of fibrosis at baseline, mice were treated once daily with subcutaneous administration of a vehicle or three different doses of NN1177 or semaglutide for 8 weeks. Hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis were assessed by immunohistochemistry and morphometric analyses. Plasma levels of lipids and liver enzymes were determined, and hepatic gene expression was analyzed by RNA sequencing. NN1177 dose-dependently reduced body weight up to 22% compared to vehicle treatment. Plasma levels of ALT, a measure of liver injury, were reduced in all treatment groups with body weight loss. The dual agonist reduced hepatic steatosis to a greater extent than semaglutide at equal body weight loss, as demonstrated by three independent methods. Both the co-agonist and semaglutide significantly decreased histological markers of inflammation such as CD11b and Galectin-3, in addition to markers of hepatic stellate activation (αSMA) and fibrosis (Collagen I). Interestingly, the maximal beneficial effects on above mentioned clinically relevant endpoints of NN1177 treatment on hepatic health appear to be achieved with the middle dose tested. Administering the highest dose resulted in a further reduction of liver fat and accompanied by a massive induction in genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and resulted in exaggerated body weight loss and a downregulation of a module of co-expressed genes involved in steroid hormone biology, bile secretion, and retinol and linoleic acid metabolism that are also downregulated due to NASH itself. These results indicate that, in a setting of overnutrition, the liver health benefits of activating the fasting-related metabolic pathways controlled by the glucagon receptor displays a bell-shaped curve. This observation is of interest to the scientific community, due to the high number of ongoing clinical trials attempting to leverage the positive effects of glucagon biology to improve metabolic health.",2024,Jan,Molecular metabolism,Thomas Monfeuga; Jenny Norlin; Anne Bugge; Elisabeth D Gaalsgaard; Cesar A Prada-Medina; Markus Latta; Sanne S Veidal; Pia S Petersen; Michael Feigh; Dorte Holst,3050,True,2024-01-01
41138841,"Incretin signaling at the crossroads of metabolism, inflammation, and tumorigenesis: implications for obesity patients.","Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are widely used for type 2 diabetes and obesity, delivering robust metabolic and cardiovascular benefits. However, their potential impact on tumorigenesis remains debated. Preclinical findings in rodents have suggested that GLP-1R activation may influence thyroid C-cells and pancreatic ducts, while human studies have yielded inconsistent cancer risk signals. This review synthesizes current evidence on GLP-1R and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) signaling in cancer biology, emphasizing the role of biased agonism and context-dependent effects. GLP-1R activation, predominantly via cAMP/PKA signaling, has shown antiproliferative effects in gastrointestinal adenocarcinomas and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma models, whereas GIPR activation frequently engages PI3K/Akt (PI3K, phosphoinositide 3-kinase; Akt, protein kinase B) and ERK/MAPK cascades (ERK, extracellular signal-regulated kinase; MAPK, mitogen-activated protein kinase), enhancing proliferation in colorectal and neuroendocrine tumors. Conversely, GLP-1R stimulation can promote growth in GLP-1R-high neuroendocrine tumors, reflecting ligand- and tissue-specific signaling biases. Beyond direct tumor cell effects, GLP-1RAs modulate the tumor microenvironment by reducing NF-κB-driven inflammation, altering stromal activity, and potentially enhancing immune surveillance. Current clinical evidence does not support a generalized increase in cancer risk with GLP-1RA therapy; benefits in metabolic control may even reduce obesity-related cancer incidence. Nonetheless, caution is advised in patients with medullary thyroid carcinoma, MEN2, or GLP-1R-high neuroendocrine tumors. The emerging paradigm suggests precision approaches, integrating receptor profiling, biased agonist design, and risk stratification, will be key to safely leveraging incretin-based therapies in oncology.",2025,Oct,European journal of pharmacology,Katarzyna Wawrzak-Pienkowska; Tomasz Pienkowski; Aleksandra Golonko; Anna Krupa; Marcin Warpechowski; Adam Filip Plonski; Patrycja Mojsak; Jaroslaw Daniluk; Andrzej Dabrowski; Krzysztof Kurek,1931,True,2025-10-01
41125863,Maternal postpartum sedentary life exacerbates the metabolic impact of moderately fat-rich diet in male mice.,"Profound social and economic changes in recent generations have led to reduced physical activity and increased calorie intake, leading to a higher incidence of metabolic disease. These effects may propagate across generations, amplifying the impact on descendants. Here we found that limited physical activity of dams brought about increased liver weight and lipid accumulation in the male offspring on a moderate fat calorie western-like diet from weaning to adulthood, while maternal voluntary exercise on running wheels during the postpartum period was sufficient to prevent the development of the phenotype in the otherwise sedentary offspring. Elevated fatty acid (FA) and reduced acylcarnitine levels in the liver of offspring of exercising mothers suggested increased FA flux for oxidation that, with elevated mitochondrial β-oxidation, indicated a maternally programmed mechanism to cope with increased fat calories. Finally, single-nucleus transcriptional profiling indicated dysregulated lipid metabolism in hepatocytes and upregulation of phagocytosis-related genes in Kupffer cells/macrophages and minimal response in stellate cells, indicating a moderate liver damage in the offspring of sedentary but not exercising mothers. A similar combination of maternal sedentary lifestyle and increased fat calorie intake from childhood could contribute to the increased incidence of obesity and NAFLD in recent generations.",2025,Oct,npj metabolic health and disease,Katherine Lopez; Madelyn R Baker; Qiuying Chen; Michele Alves-Bezerra; Baran Ersoy; Judit Gal Toth; Sandeep S Reddy; Faten Taki; Rose Sciortino; David E Cohen; Steven Gross; Miklos Toth,1429,True,2025-10-01

41071445,The Role of Pericardial Fat in Cardiometabolic Disease: Emerging Evidence and Therapeutic Potential.,"This review explores the unique anatomy and pathophysiology of pericardial fat (including both epicardial adipose tissue [EAT] and paracardial fat), its clinical significance, and its potential role as a therapeutic target. It addresses key questions regarding the contribution of EAT to cardiometabolic conditions such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular arrhythmias, and explores interventions that reduce EAT to possibly improve cardiovascular outcomes. Recent studies have established EAT as a metabolically active, pro-inflammatory fat depot directly affecting the myocardium and coronary arteries. Imaging and metabolomic studies have advanced the assessment of EAT burden. Clinical evidence supports lifestyle modification, pharmacologic therapies including GLP-1 RA and SGLT2i, and bariatric surgery to effectively reduce EAT volume. Emerging data link EAT reduction with improved cardiac function and arrhythmia risk, although causality remains unclear. EAT is a modifiable cardiometabolic risk factor associated with adverse outcomes in coronary artery disease, heart failure, atrial fibrillation, and ventricular arrhythmias. Targeting EAT through cardiometabolic risk reduction strategies may improve prognosis.

We examined the association between work-related PA (WPA) or leisure-time PA (LTPA) and advanced fibrosis across the steatotic liver disease (SLD) spectrum. Data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2017-2020) in adults with hepatic steatosis were included and categorized into MASLD (n=2236), MetALD (n=1355), and ALD (n=457) based on alcohol use. PA was quantified as metabolic equivalent (MET)-minutes per week, and ≥600 MET-min/wk was used as the threshold for high activity. Adjusted logistic regression models for confounders (sex, race/ethnicity, education, income, metabolic risk factors, and etiology of SLD) were used to analyze the relationship of PA types with at-risk advanced fibrosis, according to an Agile 3+ score ≥0.45. Among 4342 SLD participants, LTPA was strongly linked to a lower risk of at-risk advanced fibrosis in MASLD (OR=0.56, 95% CI: 0.34-0.93), as well as MetALD and ALD combined (OR=0.55, 95% CI: 0.34-0.89). WPA was not associated with improved advanced fibrosis. There were no interactions between WPA and SLD subtypes (p=0.98), and between LTPA and SLD subtypes (p=0.55). LTPA but not WPA is protective for at-risk advanced fibrosis in patients with MASLD and MetALD. These findings showcase the importance of structured LTPA interventions to mitigate fibrosis risk in SLD.

The causal relationship between secreted VLDL density and insulin sensitivity in the context of the E167K variant remains unclear. E167K-carrying induced pluripotent stem cells were generated using a genome-editing method. Guided by targeted phospholipidomic analysis, we established an improved protocol to derive hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) from induced pluripotent stem cells with significantly improved VLDL secretory profiles after linoleic acid, arachidonic acid and Liver X receptor agonist exposure. Furthermore, the E167K-defined steatosis and metabolic phenotype of HLCs treated with or without dihydrotestosterone were analyzed. In public database, we stratified male subjects by testosterone level and analyzed the impact of TM6SF2 on the incidence of hepatic steatosis and T2D. E167K hepatocytes showed defective VLDL secretion and an exacerbated lipid accumulation phenotype, accompanied by a decrease in arachidonic acid-containing phosphatidylcholine. Furthermore, dihydrotestosterone supplementation worsened the steatotic phenotype of E167K HLCs without altering insulin sensitivity. In the clinical data, E167K-defined hepatic steatosis was testosterone-dosage dependent unlike the other genetic variant, while T2D was not.

39292422,Estimation of the Eligible Population For Resmetirom Among Adults in the United States for Treatment of Non-Cirrhotic NASH with Moderate-to-Advanced Liver Fibrosis.,"As of March 2024, resmetirom is the first and only therapy approved in the United States (US) for the treatment of adults with non-cirrhotic nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with moderate-to-advanced liver fibrosis (MALF) consistent with stages F2/F3 fibrosis. Estimates of the diagnosed, treatment-eligible NASH population are poorly understood due to diagnostic variability. This study provides a contemporary estimate of the size of the US resmetirom treatment-eligible population. A dynamic population calculator was developed combining literature, screening guidelines, resmetirom study criteria, and analyses of the NHANES 2017-March 2020 cycle. It computes NASH prevalence, proportion non-cirrhotic NASH with MALF, Year 1 diagnosis, and new diagnoses in Years 2 and 3. NASH prevalence was estimated by applying the American Association of Clinical Endocrinology screening algorithm and recommended NIT cut-offs in the NHANES dataset. The proportion of non-cirrhotic NASH with MALF was informed by analyses of the Forian US integrated medical claims database using NASH and cirrhosis-specific ICD-10-CM codes and FIB-4 scores. NASH diagnosis rates were obtained from published estimates and NHANES responses. Treatment-eligible population growth was projected using published incidence data. Estimates were compared to a NASH budget-impact-analysis (BIA) from the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER). In the base case, a NASH prevalence of 4.6% was modeled (range 1.3-14.2%). This value was multiplied by the proportion estimated to have non-cirrhotic MALF (i.e., 35%). Published analyses suggest a diagnosis rate of ~ 10% (range 3.3-14.3%) and ~ 16% year-over-year growth in the treatment-eligible population. Assuming a 1-million commercial-member population, the resmetirom treatment-eligible population was estimated as 1255-1699 in Years 1-3 following approval. Sensitivity analyses were conducted and comparison to the ICER BIA was influenced by different diagnosis rates. Estimation of the treatment-eligible population for resmetirom depends importantly on NASH diagnosis rates, which are predicted to be < 15% in the 3 years after drug approval. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an advanced form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Previously there were no treatments for NASH in the United States (US), but as of March 2024, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved resmetirom (REZDIFFRA™), a once-daily, oral therapy, in conjunction with diet and exercise, under accelerated approval for the treatment of adults (aged 18 years or older) with non-cirrhotic NASH with moderate-to-advanced liver fibrosis (MALF), consistent with stages F2-F3. It is not well understood how many diagnosed patients with NASH would be eligible for treatment with resmetirom; thus, this study aimed to estimate the size of the US resmetirom treatment-eligible population. To do so, we created a flexible population calculator that considers how many people have NASH, what proportion would be eligible for resmetirom treatment-i.e., have non-cirrhotic NASH with MALF-and of those how many people would be diagnosed. We used published literature, screening guidelines, resmetirom study criteria, and analyses of national surveys to inform our range of estimates. In the main analysis, we modeled a NASH prevalence of 4.6% (range 1.3-14.2%), which was then limited to the proportion estimated to have non-cirrhotic NASH with MALF (i.e., 35%) and diagnosed (i.e., 10%, range 3.3-14.3%). A year-over-year growth of approximately 16% in the treatment-eligible population was modeled in years following approval. Assuming a population of 1 million commercial insurance enrollees, the resmetirom treatment-eligible population was estimated to be 1255-1699 in Years 1-3 following approval.

40100944,Resmetirom: the first approved therapy for treating metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis.,"Metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), previously referred to as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), has emerged as one of the leading indications for liver transplantation in the United States. The disease is associated with increased cardiovascular mortality in patients with early-stage liver fibrosis and a heightened risk of hepatic complications in those with advanced fibrosis. Despite its growing prevalence and significant healthcare burden, there were no approved drugs to treat this chronic disease. In March 2024, Resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist, became the first drug to receive FDA approval for the treatment of patients with MASH and fibrosis stages F2/F3. This accelerated approval was granted based on significantly higher rates of MASH resolution and fibrosis. This review summarizes the current literature on the mechanism of action, preclinical data, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, indications, and contraindications of resmetirom in the management of patients with MASH. The approval of resmetirom for patients with MASH and moderate to advanced hepatic fibrosis is a major advance in the management of MASH.

To estimate the cross-sectional prevalence of MASH in the pediatric (<18 years) populations of MerativeTM MarketScan® Commercial Database (Commercial) and MerativeTM MarketScan® Multi-State Medicaid Database (Medicaid). Pediatric patients with ≥1 medical encounter from 1/1/2020 to 12/31/2020 and ≥6 months of continuous enrollment before the most recent medical encounter were included. MASH was confirmed by an ICD-10-CM diagnosis code for MASH (K75.81) in the medical history since 1/1/2016. A total of 1,476 and 410 pediatric MASH patients were identified in Medicaid and Commercial databases respectively, with a prevalence of 0.036% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.034%, 0.038%) in Medicaid, as compared to 0.011% (95% CI: 0.010%, 0.012%) in Commercial. Prevalence of MASH increased by age. MASH was more prevalent in those who were male, obese, had T2D, and had metabolic syndrome. Among all pediatric MASH patients, the majority were ≥10 years old, male, and obese. MASH is more prevalent among pediatric patients with comorbid conditions such as metabolic syndrome, obesity, and T2D, which appears to be similar to young adults.

41056488,Paired snRNA-seq and scRNA-seq analysis of MASLD patients to identify early-stage markers for disease progression.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Progression from simple metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver (MASL) without necro-inflammation to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) triggers fibrosis, leading to liver-related morbidity and mortality. Early recognition of MASH is imperative to enable appropriate interventions aimed at preventing liver damage. Thus, this study aimed to elucidate molecular mechanisms driving MASLD progression and identify early-stage transcriptomic signatures by analyzing paired liver tissue and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). We collected 16 paired liver and PBMC samples from 8 histologically confirmed patients with MASLD. Liver tissue was obtained by needle biopsy for single-nucleus RNA sequencing, and PBMCs underwent single-cell and bulk RNA sequencing. PBMC-liver interactions were examined to identify cross-tissue signaling, and machine learning was applied to derive transcriptomic signatures predictive of fibrosis stage. Hepatocyte transcriptomic profiling revealed distinct MASH-associated alterations, including downregulated fatty acid metabolism, upregulated immune activation pathways, and changes in tissue remodeling. PBMC analysis identified shifts in immune populations, with increased aTregs and chronic CD4+ T cell activation. Liver-PBMC interaction analysis highlighted enhanced HSC-natural killer cell signaling in MASH, linking immune responses to fibrosis progression. Machine learning identified liver-derived and PBMC-derived transcriptomic signatures that robustly distinguished mild (F0-F2) from advanced (F3-F4) fibrosis (AUC=0.93), suggesting their potential for early diagnostic stratification. Significant molecular and immune alterations occur in disease progression of MASLD to MASH, reflecting both localized hepatic changes and systemic immune dysregulation. The identified transcriptomic signatures provide a promising tool for fibrosis prediction and monitoring, underscoring the need to target early disease mechanisms for improved diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.",2025,Nov,Hepatology communications,Suebin Park; Su-Hyeon Lee; Se-Eun Han; Beom Kyung Kim; Byungjin Hwang,2166,True,2025-11-01
41067788,Liver fibrosis with persistently normal alanine transaminase levels exhibits a distinct treatment response in MASLD.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) presents considerable variability in disease progression and treatment outcomes. We aimed to determine whether specific patterns of liver inflammatory flares are correlated with distinct treatment responses. We conducted an analysis of a well-characterised prospective cohort involving treatment-naïve MASLD patients from January 2015 to November 2023 at The First Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Participants underwent a standardised 48-week lifestyle modification programme, with follow-up extending through December 2024. Liver fat content (LFC) was assessed using MRI-based proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), whereas liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) were performed using two-dimensional shear wave elastography at baseline and after 48 weeks. Participants were stratified by alanine transaminase (ALT) and liver fibrosis status: normal ALT/no fibrosis (n=149), elevated ALT/no fibrosis (n=264), normal ALT/fibrosis (n=91) and elevated ALT/fibrosis (n=178). While MRI-PDFF (≥30% LFC decline) and ALT responses (≥17 U/L decrease) did not differ between groups, the elevated ALT/fibrosis group exhibited a significantly higher probability of LSM response (≥1 fibrosis stage improvement) than in the normal ALT/ fibrosis group (53.4% vs 31.9%, p=0.001; OR=2.53, 95% CI: 1.31 to 4.85, p=0.006). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that the cut-offs for weight loss (8.55% vs 4.94%, p=0.023) and LFC reduction (39.85% vs 20.57%, p=0.062) associated with LSM response were higher in patients with normal ALT/fibrosis than in those with elevated ALT/fibrosis. MASLD patients with liver fibrosis and persistently normal ALT levels exhibited a less favourable treatment response to fibrosis than those with elevated ALT levels, necessitating more substantial reductions in steatosis and weight to achieve the desired outcomes.",2025,Oct,BMJ open gastroenterology,Ling Luo; Congxiang Shao; Long Teng; Shuyu Zhuo; Zhi Dong; Wei Wang; Junzhao Ye; Bihui Zhong,1925,True,2025-10-01

This is a participant-level post hoc analysis of the 52-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled SYNERGY-NASH trial (NCT04166773). Participants (n = 190) with MASH and stage 2/3 fibrosis were randomly assigned to receive tirzepatide (5, 10, or 15 mg) or placebo once weekly. The primary end point was MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis. Secondary end points included fibrosis improvement by at least one stage without worsening of MASH. Metabolic changes were evaluated in responders and nonresponders for histological end points in 154 participants who completed the study on treatment. At baseline, 59% had type 2 diabetes and mean BMI was 35.7 kg/m2. Compared with nonresponders, greater body weight reductions were observed in responders for MASH resolution (-16.0% vs. -7.0%; P < 0.001) and for fibrosis improvement (-13.6% vs. -9.8%; P = 0.023). Reductions in HbA1c were greater for MASH responders (-1.2% vs. -0.6%; P < 0.001) and fibrosis responders (-1.2% vs. -0.7%; P = 0.004) than for nonresponders. Compared with nonresponders, greater improvements in liver fat and measures of adipose tissue insulin sensitivity (adipose tissue insulin resistance index and adiponectin) were observed with MASH responders (P < 0.001). In causal mediation analyses, normalization of liver fat was a significant mediator of both MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement. In this post hoc exploratory analysis, MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement were associated with body weight reduction, improved glycemic control, and normalization of liver fat.

41106720,Management of patients with type 2 diabetes and MASLD: An overview and joint statement.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) are two highly prevalent diseases with rapidly growing incidences worldwide. They are frequently associated due to their shared pathophysiology and their bidirectional influence. MASLD-related liver fibrosis is a major driver of hepatic complications and is associated with increased risk of extrahepatic complications, such as cardiovascular and renal diseases in patients with T2D. In this setting, systematic screening for advanced fibrosis related to MASLD is now unanimously recommended for patients with T2D, due to its high prevalence and specific therapeutic management. The French Association for the Study of the Liver (AFEF) and the Francophone Diabetes Society (SFD) convened a group of experts to summarize the current knowledge on MASLD screening and therapeutic management in patients with T2D and thus provide a roadmap to healthcare professionals, especially diabetologists or primary care physicians. Our focus will be on the particularities of dietary and behavioral management, pharmacological treatment of T2D, and bariatric procedures in cases of MASLD. Our goal is to provide clinical guidance for adapting drug therapy in the presence of significant fibrosis in order to slow the progression of liver disease and reduce the risk of associated clinical events.",2025,Oct,Diabetes & metabolism,Yasmina Chouik; Clémence M Canivet; Jean-Baptiste Julla; Thomas Mouillot; Lucia Parlati; Alexia Rouland; Sarra Smati; Blandine Tramunt; Rodolphe Anty; Jérôme Boursier; Claire Carette; Bertrand Cariou; Laurent Castera; Armand Garioud; Bruno Guerci; Pierre Gourdy; Maeva Guillaume; Guillaume Lassailly; Raluca Pais; Jean-Michel Petit; Lawrence Serfaty; Bruno Vergès; Cyrielle Caussy,1375,True,2025-10-01
39526564,Pharmacological management of pediatric metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Pediatric obesity, characterized by a body mass index (BMI) at or above the 95th percentile for age, affects a substantial number of children and adolescents worldwide. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, represents a prominent hepatic manifestation of obesity and metabolic syndrome, emerging as the most prevalent hepatic disorder among pediatric patients and a significant contributor to liver transplantation in adults. The escalating prevalence of pediatric MASLD mirrors the alarming rise in childhood obesity rates over recent decades. While lifestyle modifications focusing on dietary changes and increased physical activity constitute the cornerstone of MASLD management, achieving and maintaining significant weight reduction remains challenging. Moreover, disease progression often persists despite standard-of-care interventions, warranting exploration into alternative therapeutic strategies. Pharmacological interventions, particularly, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), have shown promise in addressing pediatric obesity and its associated comorbidities, including MASLD. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of GLP-1RA in inducing weight loss and improving liver enzyme levels, suggesting a potential role in halting disease progression, and reducing the risk of major adverse liver outcomes. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current pharmacotherapy landscape for pediatric MASLD, with a focus on novel agents such as GLP-1RA. Furthermore, the manuscript proposes a practical algorithm to assist in integrating GLP-1RA into the clinical management of pediatric patients with obesity and MASLD. Despite promising results, further research is warranted to elucidate the long-term efficacy and safety of GLP-1RA in pediatric populations.",2025,Jan,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,Rasha Abi Radi Abou Jaoudeh; Phillipp Hartmann; Ole Olson; Olga Gupta; Seema Kumar; Samar H Ibrahim; Rima Fawaz; Amal Aqul; Sara Hassan,1881,True,2025-01-01
41137196,EXPRESS: Impact of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists on Cardiovascular Outcomes in Patients with Peripheral Artery Disease without Diabetes: A Propensity Score-Matched Analysis.,"Peripheral artery disease (PAD) is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular events. While glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have demonstrated cardiovascular benefit in patients with diabetes, their role in patients with PAD without diabetes is not well understood. This study aimed to assess the impact of GLP-1RA therapy on cardiovascular outcomes in non-diabetic PAD patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX US collaborative network, identifying adults aged 18-89 with PAD and no history of diabetes from January 2014 to January 2024. Patients treated with GLP-1RAs were compared with untreated counterparts. A 1:1 greedy nearest neighbor propensity score matching was performed to balance baseline characteristics. The primary outcomes were 3-point major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) defined as non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, or cardiovascular death , all-cause mortality, major adverse limb event (MALE) defined as limb-threatening ischemia, revascularization procedures, or major amputation. Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analysis were used to assess outcomes over a 5-year follow-up period.After matching, 13,555 patients remained per group with well-balanced covariates. GLP-1RA use was linked to lower risk of MACE (HR 0.61), all-cause mortality (HR 0.40), and amputation (HR 0.22), all p < 0.001. Secondary analyses showed reduced myocardial infarction (HR 0.53) and amputation (HR 0.32). Sensitivity analysis of post-2021 semaglutide use confirmed benefits for MACE (HR 0.55) and mortality (HR 0.30). No difference in acute pancreatitis risk.

L. Hubbs and R. R. Miller, a Catostomus from Wall Canyon Creek has been considered a putative species. Occurring in a limited range in Surprise Valley, Washoe Co., Nevada, USA, this undescribed Wall Canyon Sucker exhibits an overall similarity to other Catostomus species that are naturally distributed in close geographic proximity. Molecular phylogenetic and population genetic studies have included the Wall Canyon Sucker and refined its relationships such that it is the sister taxon of the Warner Sucker Ca. warnerensis endemic to the Warner Basin of Oregon and closely related to the Owens Sucker Ca. fumeiventris of the Owens Valley in California. All three lineages occupy drainages just east of the Cascade Range and the Sierra Nevada mountains in western North America. Multiple genetic data sources support the separation of the Wall Canyon Sucker from Ca. murivallis and Ca. warnerensis with at least a Pleistocene division without recent gene flow. Here, we formally describe Catostomus murivallis sp. nov. from Wall Canyon Creek in Surprise Valley. Catostomus murivallis is statistically significantly different from Ca. fumeiventris and Ca. warnerensis at 16 of 34 and 17 of 34 morphometric characters investigated.

41141191,Efficacy and Safety of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists for Spinal Fusion Outcomes: A Comprehensive Meta-Analysis.,"Spinal fusion is a widely performed surgical procedure for treating various spinal disorders, with lumbar fusion showing remarkably rapid growth worldwide. Despite positive outcomes after the procedure, it carries significant complications, most notably pseudarthrosis. Compromised blood supply is a key factor disrupting normal bone fusion, making optimal vascularization crucial for successful outcomes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, primarily used for diabetes management, demonstrate promising effects including enhanced glycemic control, improved vascular endothelial function, and direct enhancement of osteoblastic cell activity through GLP-1 receptors on bone precursor cells. Theoretically, GLP-1 receptor agonists should be beneficial for optimizing spinal fusion outcomes. We aim to systematically review and analyze the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 receptor agonists in promoting bone fusion and reducing complications in patients undergoing spinal fusion surgery. We conducted a comprehensive systematic review following Cochrane guidelines. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library for studies examining GLP-1 receptor agonists in spinal fusion procedures. We used the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale for the quality assessment of the included studies. We conducted a statistical analysis using RevMan 5.4 with risk ratios for dichotomous outcomes. In total, 11 studies with a total of 14,344 participants were analyzed. GLP-1 receptor agonists significantly reduced pseudoarthrosis at six months (risk ratio (RR) = 0.63, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54-0.74) and 12 months (RR = 0.64, 95% CI = 0.57-0.72), and significantly increased acute kidney injury (RR = 1.30, 95% CI = 1.03-1.65). No significant differences were observed for pseudoarthrosis at 24 months (RR = 1.03, 95% CI = 0.53-2.03), readmission rates (RR = 0.85, 95% CI = 0.48-1.51), cerebrovascular accidents (RR = 1.01, 95% CI = 0.63-1.62), and deep vein thrombosis (RR = 1.16, 95% CI = 0.78-1.72). Additionally, no significant reoperations or adverse effects were found. We also performed a subgroup analysis considering the diabetic stage, which showed valuable insights. GLP-1 receptor agonists showed promising results in reducing pseudoarthrosis at short- to medium-term follow-up, indicating potential therapeutic benefits in bone healing applications. However, the increased risk of acute kidney injury suggests the need for careful patient monitoring and risk stratification. The lack of sustained benefit at 24 months and significant heterogeneity observed in several outcomes indicate that further investigation is warranted. Future research should focus on conducting larger, well-designed randomized controlled trials with standardized outcome definitions, longer follow-up periods, and comprehensive safety monitoring to establish optimal dosing protocols and patient selection criteria for GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy in orthopedic applications.",2025,Sep,Cureus,Mohamed Zahed; Mahmoud Elmesalmi; Khaled F Al-Kharouf; Sara E Elbahnasawy; Ziad El Menawy; Salam Elhanash; Mahmoud Odeh; Nour Elnaggar; Mohamed Hesham Gamal; Mahmoud M Elhady,3013,True,2025-09-01
41121434,Bariatric surgery and semaglutide in a youth with juvenile Huntington disease and severe obesity: a case report.,"Managing severe obesity in youth with chronic, progressive conditions, such as juvenile Huntington disease, presents unique challenges. Juvenile Huntington disease, is characterized by rapid neurodegeneration, with most patients experiencing a significant decline in motor and cognitive functions within 10-20 years of symptom onset, leading to reduced life expectancy. Obesity further complicates these conditions, reducing quality of life and exacerbating physical, cognitive, and metabolic dysfunctions. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to address these complex issues. A 17-year-old Hispanic male with juvenile Huntington disease and a body mass index of 44 kg/m This case illustrates the ethical considerations and challenges of managing severe obesity in juvenile Huntington disease. The decision to proceed with bariatric surgery prioritized improving quality of life, given the patient's limited life expectancy. The use of a multimodal treatment approach, including semaglutide and laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, significantly improved both physical health and psychosocial well-being.

40847981,"New Names, New Drugs, Better Outcomes in Steatotic Liver Disease.","Steatotic liver disease (SLD) is a growing cause of chronic liver disease, with potential progression to cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and liver failure. Previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), new terminology, including metabolic-dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic-dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), was introduced to improve diagnostic clarity and reduce stigmatization. MASLD is now recognized as the hepatic manifestation of the metabolic syndrome and is the most common cause of liver disease in the UK, affecting up to 20% of adults. The incidence of MASLD-related cirrhosis and HCC is expected to rise significantly by 2030, highlighting the need for early diagnosis and treatment. For over two decades, effective medical therapies for MASLD were elusive. However, recent trials of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), thyroid hormone receptor-β (THR-β) agonist resmetirom, and fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) agonists have shown promising results in reversing steatohepatitis and potentially fibrosis. These agents potentially offer new disease-modifying treatment options for MASLD, with GLP-1 RAs particularly effective in achieving weight loss and all drugs showing promising histological benefits in patients with MASH. This review summarizes nomenclature changes, provides an update on the UK's SLD burden, with a particular focus on MASLD and MASH, and discusses new therapeutic strategies for managing this complex and increasingly prevalent condition.",2025,Aug,"British journal of hospital medicine (London, England : 2005)",Matthew Peverelle; Mzamo Mbelle; Deepak Joshi,1613,True,2025-08-01

It will continue to have a major impact on health care systems globally given its association with cardiovascular disease and liver-related complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. In recent years, promising pharmacotherapies have emerged to address MASLD and fibrosis, such as resmetirom and glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists. There are ongoing studies to better understand resmetirom, glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists, and other possible pharmacotherapies. We discuss the current available literature on resmetirom, glucagon-like-1 receptor agonists, their safety and efficacy among patients with MASLD.

41084000,Lipid metabolism and lipid signaling in extracellular vesicles ontogeny: from biogenesis to functional execution.,"This review explores the bidirectional relationship between lipids and extracellular vesicles (EVs) throughout the EV lifecycle. Lipid metabolism and lipid signaling influence EV biogenesis, cargo sorting, release, and targeting. EVs are key mediators of intercellular and interorgan communication. The cargoes carried by EVs can affect lipid metabolism and signaling pathways in target organs, thereby regulating diverse physiological and pathological processes. Recent studies indicate that EVs play critical roles in the pathological progression of various lipid metabolism-related diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes (T2DM), non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), atherosclerosis, and cancer. Importantly, disease states induce characteristic alterations in the lipid composition of circulating EVs. These disease-specific EVs show great promise as non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers. As detailed in this review, understanding the intricate interplay between lipid metabolism, lipid signaling, and EV is essential for elucidating fundamental EV biology and developing novel EV-based diagnostic and therapeutic strategies.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been extensively reported to facilitate weight loss through central satiety. Emerging evidence demonstrates additional benefits of GLP-1 RAs. Exenatide exerts direct effects on choroid plexus receptors, reducing cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) secretion and intracranial pressure (ICP), and on the ovary, enhancing follicular maturation, restoring ovulation, and improving fertility outcomes in PCOS. A 29-year-old woman with PCOS was referred from gynecology for assessment of intermittent visual blurring and chronic headaches. Ophthalmic examination revealed normal monocular visual acuity of 6/5 in each eye but reduced binocular vision of 6/12, associated with double vision. She also reported a weight gain of 15 kg over eight months. Fundoscopy was unremarkable, with no optic disc swelling. IIH without papilledema (IIHWOP) was diagnosed based on magnetic resonance imaging showing an enlarged pituitary fossa, partial empty sella, and optic nerve sheath dilatation, with lumbar puncture confirming a raised opening pressure of 280 mmH₂O and normal CSF. Initial treatment with acetazolamide was discontinued due to intolerance. Exenatide was subsequently initiated, leading to early improvement in headache frequency and diplopia, independent of weight loss. Menstrual cycles, hormonal profile, and insulin resistance also improved beyond the effect of metformin alone. This case highlights the potential of exenatide to provide dual therapeutic benefits in IIH and PCOS, acting through direct receptor-mediated pathways to reduce ICP, improve headaches, and restore ovulatory cycles, and indirectly through the reduction of central obesity. Further studies are warranted to establish its role in the combined management of these conditions.",2025,Oct,Cureus,Despina Nicolaou; Nicolas Nicolaou; Lisa M Douglas; Savvas Christou,1950,True,2025-10-01
39752752,Dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide alleviates hepatic steatosis and modulates gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism in diabetic mice.,"Tirzepatide is a dual agonist of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptors and is a promising therapeutic option for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nevertheless, its effect and underlying mechanism on hepatic steatosis remain ambiguous. Herein, we explored the impact of tirzepatide on improving hepatic steatosis in diabetic mice, with a particular focus on the gut microbiota and bile acids (BAs) using animal models. The tirzepatide effectively reduced body weight, improved insulin resistance, decreased serum and hepatic lipid levels, and mitigated liver injury. Compared to semaglutide, tirzepatide exhibited superior efficacy in reducing hepatic lipid accumulation. 16S rRNA gene sequencing and targeted metabolomics of BAs revealed that tirzepatide ameliorated gut microbiota dysbiosis and BAs metabolism in diabetic mice. Notably, tirzepatide observably increased the abundance of beneficial genera such as Akkermansia, elevated the ratio of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) antagonists (glycoursodeoxycholic acid: GUDCA, β-muricholic acid: β-MCA, hyodeoxycholic acid: HDCA, ursodeoxycholic acid: UDCA) to natural agonists (cholic acid: CA, lithocholic acid: LCA, chenodeoxycholic acid: CDCA, glycocholic acid: GCA, taurodeoxycholic acid: TDCA), and reduced FXR expression in intestinal tissues. In conclusion, tirzepatide attenuated hepatic steatosis in diabetic mice and regulated the gut microbiota and BAs metabolism, which may help to provide a novel therapeutic approach and therapeutic target for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).",2025,Feb,International immunopharmacology,Weiting Hu; Wenyu Gong; Fan Yang; Rui Cheng; Gerong Zhang; Lu Gan; Yikun Zhu; Weiwei Qin; Ying Gao; Xing Li; Jing Liu,1630,True,2025-02-01
41130970,Niche-associated Type IV collagen promotes GLP-1/Notch receptor activation in the C. elegans germline.,"Basement membranes are thin and dense proteinaceous layers that surround tissues to maintain their structure. With age, chronic inflammation typically stiffens this basement membrane through a phenomenon called fibrosis, which is reflected by increasing levels of the basement membrane's main structural component, type IV collagen (COL IV). Tissue fibrosis and elevated Notch signalling are two co-occurring hallmarks of many inflammation-linked diseases, including cancer, but their in vivo relationship has not been clearly defined. Here we show that EMB-9/COL IV accumulation around the C. elegans germline stem cell niche promotes GLP-1/Notch receptor activation in germline stem cells. Moreover, we find that contrasting with previous beliefs, reducing GLP-1/Notch activity in vivo leads to a generalized dramatic increase in EMB-9/COL IV levels, and thereby promotes fibrosis. The generalized fibrosis that comes along with inflammaging may therefore act as a root cause for cancer by promoting Notch signalling, and perhaps other ligand-receptor interactions.",2025,Oct,Nature communications,Pier-Olivier Martel; Rustelle Janse van Vuuren; Julia Degrémont; Sarah Turmel-Couture; Armi M Chaudhari; Eden Dologuele; Lucie Beaulieu; Alexandre Clouet; Patrick Narbonne,1068,True,2025-10-01

Alström syndrome (AS) is a rare, genetic, multi-systemic disorder, characterized by cone-rod dystrophy, progressive hearing loss, obesity and diabetes with profound insulin resistance due to marked hyperphagia. Here we highlight the potential of tirzepatide as novel therapeutic option for improving glycemic outcomes, metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and effectively reducing body weight in individuals with AS. We present the first two reported cases of people living with AS treated with tirzepatide. Two individuals with AS, previously treated with semaglutide received tirzepatide in our clinic. The first, a 23-year-old male with 18 months on treatment, experienced weight loss of -28 kg (113.6 kg to 83 kg, -26.9%); HbA1c decreased by -0.4% (6.7% to 6.3%), with considerable reductions in daily insulin doses of -96 IU/day (-83%; 58 to 20 IU insulin glargine and 58 to 0 IU prandial insulin), while maintaining oral antidiabetics.

41041641,Digital multicriteria evaluation of negotiated medicines using Chinese mini-HTA: application of structured methodologies in assessing once-weekly GLP-1 RAs for improved clinical decision-making.,"Systematic and transparent evaluation of medicines remains a global challenge. In China, structured frameworks for clinical value assessment are underutilized despite improved access to negotiated medicines. Once-weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) were selected as a representative case for their reimbursement status and clinical and economic relevance. This study applied a quantitative mini-health (mini-HTA) technology assessment to support rational drug selection. A structured, three-stage methodology was employed to evaluate four once-weekly GLP-1 RAs. First, a weighted scoring system was established for five dimensions-pharmaceutical properties, effectiveness, safety, economy, and other considerations-based on expert consensus using the Quantitative Record Form for Drug Evaluation and Selection in Medical Institutions. Second, evidence for each dimension was systematically collected using a PICO-based search strategy across guideline databases, literature sources, and official documents. Third, each drug was quantitatively scored in each dimension according to predefined criteria and expert-assigned weights; the total scores were used to classify drugs into recommendation levels (""strongly recommended,"" ""weakly recommended,"" or ""not recommended"") to guide evidence-based selection in medical institutions. Semaglutide (77.8) and dulaglutide (76.3) achieved the highest totals, driven by superior HbA1c reduction and proven cardiovascular benefit, and were strongly recommended. Exenatide microspheres scored 70.2, mainly owing to favourable acquisition cost, and was also strongly recommended. PEG loxenatide scored 62.9, limited by narrower reimbursement coverage and lower international uptake, and received a weak recommendation. Safety profiles were comparable across agents. The study demonstrates that a structured, expert-informed mini-HTA framework can be feasibly applied for quantitative evaluation and selection of once-weekly GLP-1 RAs in Chinese medical institutions. Key differentiators among agents were efficacy (notably cardiovascular benefit) and economic/policy factors, while safety differences were minimal.

The uric acid to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (UHR) integrates key metabolic pathways in NAFLD, but its precise relationship and effect modifiers remain unclear. Herein, we explored the correlation between UHR and NAFLD. This secondary analysis used data from 1,592 Chinese adults (40-70 years) undergoing health checks. NAFLD was diagnosed via ultrasound. UHR was calculated as serum uric acid (μmol/L) divided by high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (HDL-C) (mmol/L). Association between UHR and NAFLD was assessed using multivariable logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS) for non-linearity, and threshold analysis. Receiver Operating Characteristic analysis was utilized to assess the ability of UHR to predict the NAFLD. Subgroup analyses explored effect modification. NAFLD prevalence was 61.1%. After full adjustment, each one standard deviation (SD) increase in UHR was associated with 22% higher NAFLD odds [odds ratio (OR) = 1.22, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.03-1.46]. RCS revealed significant non-linearity ( UHR is an independent, non-linear predictor of NAFLD in Chinese adults, with a distinct risk threshold.

While preoperative weight management strategies are often used to mitigate these risks, scalable interventions remain limited. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) are an emerging pharmacological approach for weight loss, but their perioperative safety remains uncertain. This study aimed to assess the safety and efficacy of preoperative GLP-1 therapy in elective surgical systems. In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we systematically searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, and the Cochrane Library from database inception to March 31, 2025, for studies evaluating preoperative GLP-1 RA use in adults undergoing elective surgery, with no language restriction. The primary outcome was perioperative safety, defined as any complication within 90 days after surgery. The secondary outcome was preoperative weight loss. Both frequentist and Bayesian random-effects meta-analyses were conducted. A Bayesian hierarchical meta-regression was used to explore effect modifiers on the primary outcome. A risk-of-bias and Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) assessment were done to determine the certainty of the evidence. Final GRADE judgements were made by two independent reviewers, with consensus reached through discussion. Between-study heterogeneity was quantified using the  A total of 21 studies, comprising 97,059 patients, met inclusion criteria; 31.9% (n = 30,981) received preoperative GLP-1 RA therapy. Most studies were single-centre observational cohorts from high-income countries, with no randomised trials identified. Postoperative complications were reported in 12 studies, with no evidence of increased risk in GLP-1 users (pooled odds ratio: 0.78, 95% confidence interval: 0.59-1.05). The pooled estimate shows high heterogeneity ( Preoperative GLP-1 RA therapy may support clinically meaningful weight loss without a clear signal of increased perioperative risk, offering a potentially scalable strategy for surgical optimisation. However, the certainty of current evidence is very low, with most studies observational in design and at risk of bias. Amid rising global obesity rates and mounting surgical backlogs, the role of GLP-1RAs in perioperative care remains a critical unanswered question. Robust randomised trials are needed to establish their clinical value, cost-effectiveness, and implementation potential across diverse surgical systems.

Their therapeutic use over the past few years is no longer restricted to glucose metabolism only, but increasingly, more evidence is suggesting their anti-inflammatory actions. Low-grade inflammation for prolonged periods is a important participant in the pathogenesis of insulin resistance and metabolic syndrome. It has been demonstrated that GLP-1RAs influence immune functions and suppress inflammation via influencing key signalling pathways, such as c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB), and the nucleotide-binding domain, leucine-rich-containing family, pyrin domain-containing-3 (NLRP3) inflammasome. These signaling pathways are involved in cellular stress responses and cytokine production resulting in insulin resistance. By modulating both inflammatory and metabolic targets, GLP-1RAs are a potential class of immunometabolic modulators. This mini-review emphasizes the dual impact of GLP-1RAs and their therapeutic application in the overall management of insulin resistance and metabolic disorders.",2025,Oct,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Murtala A Ngabea; Igbayilola Yusuff Dimeji,1274,True,2025-10-01

Thus, in this study, we discovered CS271011, a novel THR-β agonist, and assessed the safety and efficiency of CS271011 compared to MGL-3196  We conducted luciferase reporter gene assays to assess the activation of THR-β and α in vitro. C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet for 12 weeks, CS271011 was administered by gavage at the dose of 1 mg/kg and 3 mg/kg, and MGL-3196 was administered at the dose of 3 mg/kg for 10 weeks. Body weight, food intake, serum and hepatic parameters, histological analysis, pharmacokinetic studies, RNA sequencing of the liver and heart, and expression of hepatic lipid-metabolic genes were determined to evaluate the safety and efficiency of CS271011. Compared with MGL-3196, CS271011 showed higher THR-β activation in vitro. In the diet-induced obesity mice model, CS271011 demonstrated favourable pharmacokinetic properties in mice and was enriched in the liver. Finally, CS271011 improved dyslipidaemia and reduced liver steatosis in the diet-induced obesity murine model. Mechanistically, CS271011 and MGL-3196 showed potent regulation of lipid metabolism-related genes.

41129062,Repurposing levothyroxine for managing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is an entity closely linked to obesity and/or insulin resistance, projected to affect about half of the global adult population by 2040. New therapeutic strategies that are both effective and affordable are needed to address this impending public health crisis. A narrative review was conducted to identify studies supporting the use of levothyroxine and thyroid hormone analogs in treating MASLD and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Clinical studies have identified clear pathophysiological links between low (or low-normal) thyroid function and increased risk of hepatic steatosis. Of the two main thyroid hormone receptor (THR) isoforms, THRα and THRβ, the latter primarily mediates the metabolic effects of thyroid hormones in the liver, which could greatly benefit patients with MASLD. Recently, selective analogs of hepatic THRβ receptors have been developed to treat MASLD, with early clinical data demonstrating an effective profile. However, due to the increasing prevalence of MASLD in both developed and developing countries, the high cost of branded drugs may hinder their widespread use. Although the development of thyromimetics mainly aims to prevent activation of THRα in other tissues, there is evidence supporting the efficacy and safety of low-dose levothyroxine (LT4) therapy for treating MASLD. This review aims to systematically explore the potential of LT4 therapy as an alternative approach to managing MASLD.",2025,Oct,Endocrine,Leonidas H Duntas; Stergios A Polyzos; Ulrike Gottwald-Hostalek; Bogumila Urgatz; Paul M Yen,1523,True,2025-10-01

A recent study by Huang and colleagues analysed the US Food and Drug Administration Adverse Event Reporting System database, and found a significant association between GLP-1 receptor agonist use and impaired gastric emptying events, which can lead to aspiration. Recent guidelines suggest that most patients can continue taking GLP-1 receptor agonists before surgery, and those at high risk for gastrointestinal issues should follow a 24-hour liquid diet beforehand, but determining which patients are at high risk for aspiration remains a challenge for clinicians.",2025,Oct,British journal of anaesthesia,Gavin G Ovsak; Tong J Gan,767,True,2025-10-01

Due to its efficacy in weight loss, semaglutide has gained worldwide popularity, particularly the branded version Ozempic, resulting in off-label use by people seeking rapid weight loss. The resulting high demand has led to an increase in falsified products sold by unregulated online marketplaces. We present a case of a 31-year-old woman who was admitted to the emergency room in a hypoglycaemic coma after self-administrating semaglutide (Ozempic) obtained from a website. Toxicological analysis showed that the vial contained insulin instead of semaglutide, therefore leading to severe hypoglycaemia. This case highlights the growing concern regarding falsified medicines sold in the online drug market and the associated risk of severe adverse events.

41123381,Adjunctive diabetes therapies and cardiovascular protection in type 1 diabetes: tackling the challenging Tchaikovsky piece.,"This review aims to discuss the cardiometabolic-renal-glycaemic effects of adjunctive diabetes agents in the management of type 1 diabetes. Recent studies have investigated the effectiveness and safety of adjunctive diabetes agents such as metformin, SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in individuals with type 1 diabetes. A rising trend of use of diabetes technology, notably continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) devices, with improvement of glycaemic control, is observed. Questions arise whether these adjunctive diabetes agents and technologies confer cardiometabolic protective effects in patients with type 1 diabetes. The most widely studied adjunctive diabetes agent for type 1 diabetes is metformin. Meta-analyses suggest that metformin modestly improves glucose control, weight, lipid profile, and carotid intima-media thickness in patients with type 1 diabetes and mild obesity. SGLT2 inhibitors have been shown to modestly improve glycaemic control, weight, and blood pressure but are associated with increased risk of diabetic ketoacidosis in individuals with type 1 diabetes. The use of GLP-1 RA in type 1 diabetes with mild obesity provided modest HbA1c and weight reduction, but gastrointestinal side effects were common. The results of the ongoing phase 3 clinical trial of finerenone study in type 1 diabetes on chronic kidney disease progression are awaited. Observational studies suggest that CSII and CGM may also reduce cardiovascular events and hospitalizations in patients with type 1 diabetes.",2025,Oct,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",Wei Ting Wang; Wann Jia Loh,1580,True,2025-10-01
38578141,The first MASH drug therapy on the horizon: Current perspectives of resmetirom.,"The rising prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) poses a significant global health challenge, affecting over 30% of adults worldwide. MASLD is linked to increased mortality rates and substantial healthcare costs, primarily driven by its progression to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which can lead to severe liver complications including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Despite its growing burden, effective pharmacotherapy for MASLD/MASH has been lacking until the recent conditional approval of resmetirom by the FDA. Resmetirom, a liver-targeted thyroid hormone receptor-β selective drug, has shown promise in clinical trials for treating non-cirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis. It has demonstrated efficacy in reducing hepatic fat content, improving liver histology (both MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement), and ameliorating biomarkers of liver damage without significant effects on body weight or glucose metabolism. Notably, resmetirom also exhibits favourable effects on circulating lipids, potentially reducing cardiovascular risk in MASLD/MASH patients. The safety profile of resmetirom appears acceptable, with gastrointestinal adverse events being the most common, though generally mild or moderate. However, long-term surveillance is warranted to monitor for potential risks related to thyroid, gonadal, or bone diseases. Clinical implementation of resmetirom faces challenges in patient selection and monitoring treatment response, and will heavily rely on non-invasive tests for liver fibrosis assessment. Nonetheless, resmetirom represents a landmark breakthrough in MASLD/MASH treatment, paving the way for future therapeutic strategies aiming to mitigate the multifaceted risks associated with this complex metabolic liver disease.",2024,Jul,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,Salvatore Petta; Giovanni Targher; Stefano Romeo; Utpal B Pajvani; Ming-Hua Zheng; Alessio Aghemo; Luca V C Valenti,1846,True,2024-07-01
41158635,Comparative effectiveness of empagliflozin versus dapagliflozin in adults with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) show promise in treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, the relative efficacy of different SGLT2is remains unclear. We aimed to compare the clinical effectiveness of empagliflozin versus dapagliflozin in adults with MASLD. Using the TriNetX database, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of adults with MASLD who were newly prescribed either empagliflozin or dapagliflozin between January 2013 and September 2024. After propensity score matching, we compared 13,274 patients in each group. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause hospitalization, all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs), major adverse kidney events (MAKEs), and decompensated hepatic events. Secondary outcomes included each individual component of the primary outcome. Empagliflozin was associated with a lower risk of primary composite outcomes compared to dapagliflozin (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.80-0.88). This benefit was consistent across most subgroups, including sex, presence of liver cirrhosis, heart failure, T2DM, and chronic kidney disease. Significant interactions were observed for age groups (p=0.04) and borderline for BMI categories (p=0.06). Empagliflozin also showed lower risks for all-cause hospitalization (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.79-0.88), all-cause mortality (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.66-0.96), MACE (HR, 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99), and MAKE (HR, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.47-0.86), but no difference in decompensated hepatic events (HR, 1.01; 95% CI, 0.81-1.27). In patients with MASLD, empagliflozin was associated with better clinical outcomes compared to dapagliflozin, particularly in reducing cardiovascular and renal events, hospitalizations, and mortality.",2025,01,Frontiers in endocrinology,Jheng-Yan Wu; Yu-Kuan Tu; Chia-Chih Kuo; Mei-Yuan Liu; Wan-Hsuan Hsu; Ya-Wen Tsai; Ting-Hui Liu; Po-Yu Huang; Min-Hsiang Chuang; Kuo-Chuan Hung; Tsung Yu; Kuang-Ming Liao; Chih-Cheng Lai,1766,True,2025-01-01

Therefore, the present study explored the relationship between bioelectrical impedance analysis parameters, handgrip, and MASLD in youth. This study extracted 337 youths from population-based data. Pearson correlation analyses were conducted to assess the relationship between muscle-related bioelectrical impedance analysis and handgrip parameters. Logistic regression analysis investigated the associations among MASLD, bioelectrical impedance analysis, and handgrip strength. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were calculated to compare diagnostic performances of these markers in predicting MASLD. Grip strength, handgrip to weight, and handgrip to body mass index (BMI) were correlated with all muscle-related bioelectrical impedance analysis parameters, including the fat-free mass, appendicular muscle mass, skeletal muscle mass index, and muscle to fat ratio. Multivariable logistic regression analyses-adjusting for age, sex, energy intake, and nutrition-showed that skeletal muscle mass index, muscle to fat ratio, handgrip to weight, and handgrip to BMI were negatively associated with MASLD, whereas body fat mass and percentage of body fat were positively associated. The areas under the ROC curve of handgrip to weight, skeletal muscle mass index, muscle to fat ratio, body fat mass, and percentage of body fat in predicting MASLD were 0.71, 0.76, 0.81, 0.94, and 0.87, respectively.

This case-control study aimed to explore the association between gut microbiota composition and NAFLD in overweight and obese Iranian children and adolescents. Given the recent updates in nomenclature, we refer to NASLD as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), in accordance with new international consensus. A total of 66 participants, including 33 MASLD cases and 33 controls, with a case control study design were enrolled. MASLD diagnosis was done using an ultrasonography scan of the liver and gastroenterologist confirmation. Furthermore, gut microbiota composition was analyzed using real-time PCR, and metabolic, anthropometric, and dietary data were collected. The mean age of the study population (39.4% girl) was 136.82 month and mean BMI Z-score was 3.05. Regarding the gut microbiota composition, the only considerable variation was the lower abundance of Coprococcus genera in the MASLD group. Based on the analysis in the crude model and with adjustments for age, sex, and BMI, an inverse correlation was detected between the number of Coprococcus bacteria and the odds of MASLD(OR = 0.87, 95% CI: 0.77-0.98; P trend = 0.032 and OR = 0.81, 95% CI: 0.67-0.99; P trend = 0.046, respectively). However, this correlation was no longer present in the fully adjusted model. Furthermore, a negative correlation was noted between Coprococcus and ALT levels. On the other hand, the Prevotella bacteria represented significant positive correlations with both ALT and AST levels. Significant differences in gut microbiota composition were observed between MASLD and control groups, including reduced SCFA-producing and increased pro-inflammatory bacteria. These findings highlight the microbiota's potential role in MASLD pathogenesis, though confirmation in larger cohorts is needed.",2025,Oct,BMC pediatrics,Pejman Rohani; Shima Shojaie; Ali Nikparast; Mohsen Shaygantabar; Fateme Ettehad Marvasti; Golaleh Asghari; Hanieh-Sadat Ejtahed; Mohammad Hassan Sohouli; Shirin Hasani-Ranjbar; Seyed Davar Siadat; Bagher Larijani; Afshin Ostovar,1996,True,2025-10-01
41068063,Effect of Statins and PCSK9 Inhibition on Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"Dyslipidemia is common in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and, along with other metabolic comorbidities, accounts for an increased cardiovascular risk. Effective treatment of dyslipidemia not only reduces such risk but may have a beneficial effect on MASLD as well. Here we reviewed published data on the efficacy and safety of available hypolipidemic treatments for MASLD. Statins are the mainstay of hypolipidemic therapy for MASLD. In patients with compensated cirrhosis, statins are safe and can improve the risks of decompensation and hepatocellular carcinoma as well as mortality. However, in those with decompensated cirrhosis, statins should not be used unless there are strong indications that outweigh the risk of adverse events. Studies on proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors acting as the second-line therapy in MASLD remain scarce. Preliminary clinical data support their protective roles in MASLD; however, preclinical data raise concerns regarding safety, in particular with complete PCSK9 inhibition due to hepatocyte lipid accumulation. While more evidence is required to elucidate the role of PCSK9 inhibitors, statins should be used for the treatment of hyperlipidemia in patients with MASLD according to their cardiovascular risk stratification.",2025,Oct,Journal of digestive diseases,Eleni Theocharidou; Thomas Gossios,1342,True,2025-10-01
41172431,LIPOTOXICITY PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANGIOGENESIS AND MICROCIRCULATORY MODULATION IN MASLD SPECTRUM.,"Chronic liver diseases (CLDs), particularly metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), represent a significant global health burden, with potential progression to fibrosis, portal hypertension, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This review explores the role of vascular remodeling and angioarchitecture in MASLD pathogenesis, emphasizing the importance of microvascular changes, endothelial dysfunction, and angiogenesis in disease progression. Hepatic steatosis leads to hepatocyte enlargement and sinusoidal compression, disrupting microcirculation and oxygenation. Lipotoxicity, which is driven by excess fatty acids and oxidative stress, triggers inflammation and vascular permeability, fostering a proangiogenic environment. Capillarization of liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) contribute to fibrosis and neovascularization. Angiogenesis, especially via VEGF and other cytokines, is implicated in the transition from steatosis to steatohepatitis (MASH) and ultimately HCC, even in non-cirrhotic livers. Notably, portal hypertension may develop early in MASLD, independent of cirrhosis. Given the central role of vascular alterations in MASLD, future therapies may target endothelial and stromal cell interactions. Further research is needed to delineate disease-specific mechanisms and their implications for fibrosis and carcinogenesis. . As doenças hepáticas crônicas (DHCs), especialmente a doença hepática gordurosa associada ao metabolismo (MASLD), representam um ônus significativo para a saúde global, com potencial progressão para fibrose, hipertensão portal e carcinoma hepatocelular (CHC). Esta revisão explora o papel da remodelação vascular e da angioarquiteturana na patogênese da MASLD, enfatizando a importância das alterações microvasculares, da disfunção endotelial e da angiogênese na progressão da doença. A esteatose hepática leva ao aumento dos hepatócitos e à compressão sinusoidal, interrompendo a microcirculação e a oxigenação. A lipotoxicidade, impulsionada pelo excesso de ácidos graxos e estresse oxidativo, desencadeia inflamação e permeabilidade vascular, favorecendo um ambiente pró-angiogênico. A capilarização das células endoteliais sinusoidais do fígado (LSECs) e a ativação das células estreladas hepáticas (HSCs) contribuem para a fibrose e a neovascularização. A angiogênese, especialmente via VEGF e outras citocinas, está implicada na transição da esteatose para a esteato-hepatite (MASH) e, finalmente, para o CHC, mesmo em fígados não cirróticos. Notavelmente, a hipertensão portal pode se desenvolver precocemente na MASLD, independentemente da cirrose. Dado o papel central das alterações vasculares na MASLD, futuras terapias podem ter como alvo as interações entre células endoteliais e estromais. Mais pesquisas são necessárias para delinear os mecanismos específicos da doença e suas implicações para a fibrose e a carcinogênese.",2025,01,Arquivos de gastroenterologia,André Bubna Hirayama; Isabela Bodaczny Taliberti; Claudia Pinto Marques Souza de Oliveira; Venâncio Avancini Ferreira Alves,2953,True,2025-01-01
41045908,Semaglutide and Exercise Function in Obesity-Related HFpEF: Insights From the STEP-HFpEF Program.,"Exercise function quantified by 6-minute walk distance (6MWD) is severely impaired in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). This prespecified secondary analysis of pooled data from the STEP-HFpEF Program (Research Study to Investigate How Well Semaglutide Works in People Living With Heart Failure and Obesity) examined factors associated with impaired exercise function at baseline, detailed effects of semaglutide on 6MWD, and on other key trial endpoints according to baseline 6MWD in patients with HFpEF. Associates of 6MWD were assessed at baseline, and effects of semaglutide on 6MWD were evaluated at early (20 weeks) and final (52 weeks) time points, across subgroups, and according to the magnitude of weight loss achieved. Effects of semaglutide on the dual primary (changes in Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire-Clinical Summary Score [KCCQ-CSS] and body weight) and secondary/exploratory endpoints were contrasted by tertiles of baseline 6MWD. The authors randomized 1,145 patients to semaglutide or placebo. Compared with patients who had obesity-related HFpEF and higher 6MWD, those with lower 6MWD were older and had lower KCCQ-CSS, higher body mass index and waist circumference, greater systemic inflammation (higher C-reactive protein), and more severe congestion (higher N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, more diuretic use). Treatment with semaglutide increased 6MWD compared with placebo, an effect apparent at 20 weeks (treatment difference 14.6 m [95% CI: 8.6-20.7 m; P < 0.0001]) that was maintained at 52 weeks (treatment difference 17.1 m [95% CI: 9.2-25.0 m; P < 0.0001]). Increases in 6MWD with semaglutide (vs placebo) were similar across all relevant subgroups, with no significant interactions. Treatment with semaglutide increased KCCQ-CSS and reduced body weight, reduced C-reactive protein, improved the hierarchical composite (death, heart failure events, change in KCCQ-CSS and 6MWD), and reduced N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide across the spectrum of baseline 6MWD (all P In patients with obesity-related HFpEF, impaired 6MWD is most strongly associated with excess adiposity, congestion, and inflammation. Semaglutide-mediated improvements in HF-related symptoms, physical limitations, and exercise function were consistent across the spectrum of baseline 6MWD, observed as early as 20 weeks after the initiation of treatment, preceding maximal weight loss. The effects were consistent across subgroups. There was strong correlation between greater magnitude of weight loss and greater improvements in 6MWD.

39355484,"Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists: Exploring Their Impact on Diabetes, Obesity, and Cardiovascular Health Through a Comprehensive Literature Review.","Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RAs) are a novel class of medications promising for treating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity-related conditions such as cardiovascular disease (CVD) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This comprehensive literature review examines available research on these medications, focusing on their mechanisms of action, clinical effectiveness, safety profiles, and socioeconomic implications. A comprehensive search was performed using the PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane Library databases. Although initially developed for glucose management, these drugs have also demonstrated efficacy in promoting weight loss and reducing the risk of CVD. GLP-1-RAs function similarly to naturally occurring incretins. They stimulate insulin secretion in response to glucose levels, inhibit glucagon release, delay stomach emptying, and generate a sense of fullness via brain pathways. Head-to-head clinical studies have indicated that GLP-1-RAs outperform conventional antidiabetic medicines in terms of glycemic management and weight reduction. According to cardiovascular outcome studies, various drugs in this category have been found to reduce the frequency of severe adverse cardiovascular events. A common side effect is gastrointestinal toxicity, which can be mitigated by gradually increasing the dose. Personalized treatment is likely because the effectiveness, safety, and dose regimens of currently available GLP-1-RAs differ. GLP-1-RAs are a superior choice for patients with T2DM, especially those who already have CVD or require weight-control support. The high cost of these drugs creates hurdles to access and fair healthcare.

38954663,Pharmacotherapeutic options for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: where are we today?,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is defined by hepatic steatosis and cardiometabolic risk factors like obesity, type 2 diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Persistent metabolic injury may promote inflammatory processes resulting in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and liver fibrosis. Mechanistic insights helped to identify potential drug targets, thereby supporting the development of novel compounds modulating disease drivers. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has recently approved the thyroid hormone receptor β-selective thyromimetic resmetirom as the first compound to treat MASH and liver fibrosis. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current and potential future pharmacotherapeutic options and their modes of action. Lessons learned from terminated clinical trials are discussed together with the first results of trials investigating novel combinational therapeutic approaches. Approval of resmetirom as the first anti-MASH agent may revolutionize the therapeutic landscape. However, long-term efficacy and safety data for resmetirom are currently lacking. In addition, heterogeneity of MASLD reflects a major challenge to define effective agents. Several lead compounds demonstrated efficacy in reducing obesity and hepatic steatosis, while anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic effects of monotherapy appear less robust.

41149034,Analysis of Price Dynamic Competition and Stability in Cross-Border E-Commerce Supply Chain Channels Empowered by Blockchain Technology.,"Based on the perspective of multi-stage dynamic competition, this study constructs a discrete dynamic model of price competition between the ""direct sales"" and ""resale"" channels in cross-border e-commerce (CBEC) under three blockchain deployment modes. Drawing on nonlinear dynamics theory, the Nash equilibrium of the system and its stability conditions are examined. Using numerical simulations, the effects of factors such as the channel price adjustment speed, tariff rate, and commission ratio on the dynamic evolution, entropy, and stability of the system under the empowerment of blockchain technology are investigated. Furthermore, the impact of noise factors on system stability and the corresponding chaos control strategies are further analyzed. This study finds that a single-channel deployment tends to induce asymmetric system responses, whereas dual-channel collaborative deployment helps enhance strategic coordination. An increase in price adjustment speed, tariffs, and commission rates can drive the system's pricing dynamics from a stable state into chaos, thereby raising its entropy, while the adoption of blockchain technology tends to weaken dynamic stability. Therefore, after deploying blockchain technology, each channel should make its pricing decisions more cautiously. Moderate noise can exert a stabilizing effect, whereas excessive disturbances may cause the system to diverge. Hence, enterprises should carefully assess the magnitude of disturbances and capitalize on the positive effects brought about by moderate fluctuations. In addition, the delayed feedback control method can effectively suppress chaotic fluctuations and enhance system stability, demonstrating strong adaptability across different blockchain deployment modes.",2025,Oct,"Entropy (Basel, Switzerland)",Le-Bin Wang; Jian Chai; Lu-Ying Wen,1767,True,2025-10-01

41077375,Impact of GLP-1 analogues on immune-mediated inflammatory diseases: A systematic review.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) are believed to have anti-inflammatory properties apart from antidiabetic and anti-obesity effects. We performed a systematic review to evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLP1RA in immune-mediated inflammatory disorders (IMIDs). A systematic search was done on 3rd April 2025 in PubMed, Scopus, and Embase for studies reporting the use of GLP1RA among patients with IMIDs. Because of significant heterogeneity and overlapping data originating from the same insurance databases, we decided against performing a data synthesis and meta-analysis. We summarised the data regarding clinical and metabolic outcomes in patients with IMIDs with/without the use of GLP1RA. Thirty-three studies (20 full text, 13 conference abstracts) were included, of which 20 studies focused on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and 13 on other IMIDs. Of the three studies reporting on new onset IBD/IMID in GLP1RA users, 2 showed a lower incidence. IBD therapy utilization was reported in 13 studies; steroid use was lower in 5 studies, but the data on the use of biologics were inconclusive. Other outcomes, like hospitalization, IBD complications, surgery, and mortality, seemed to be better in GLP1RA cohorts in a few of the studies. Similarly, psoriasis disease activity-related outcomes were better in the GLP1RA cohort, but the effect on other IMIDs was limited by sparse literature. A total of 12 studies reported metabolic outcomes, including weight loss, glycaemic control, waist circumference, and lipid parameters, all of which showed beneficial effects of GLP1RAs, and these results were comparable to non-IBD/IMID controls. Adverse events (AEs) were reported by 13 studies; gastrointestinal (GI) AEs were higher in the GLP1RA cohort (but the majority were non-severe). GLP1RA use is associated with better disease activity and metabolic outcomes in patients with IMIDs and concomitant metabolic disorders. https://osf.io/jvmz6.",2025,Oct,Autoimmunity reviews,Chhagan L Birda; Fadwa Ibrahim; Abhirup Chatterjee; Anuraag Jena; Vishal Sharma; Shaji Sebastian,1969,True,2025-10-01
41073924,Glymphatic alteration in NAFLD patient: a preliminary magnetic resonance imaging study based on DTI-ALPS.,"This study aims to investigate alterations in glymphatic system (GS) function in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and explore the relationship of these alterations with cognition and clinical indicators. In this cross-sectional study, forty-three patients with pre-cirrhotic NAFLD (male: 37, mean age: 38.2 ± 6.7 years) and twenty-three age-, sex-, and education-matched controls (male: 17, mean age: 41.0 ± 6.7 years) underwent diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) examination and cognitive measurements. The DTI analysis along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index, calculated from the DTI data, assessed differences in GS function between the two groups. Linear regression analysis examined the relationship between the ALPS index and Z-transformed cognitive scores. Spearman/Pearson correlation analysis was conducted for assessing the relationship of the ALPS index with clinical indicators. After adjusted for age, sex, and BMI, NAFLD patients exhibited significantly lower ALPS index and higher diffusivity of projection fibers in the direction of the y-axis than controls (both P < 0.001). In the NAFLD group, the ALPS index was significantly correlated with the Mini-Mental State Examination score (beta [95% CI] = 2.123 [0.156, 4.091], P = 0.035) and the clock drawing score (beta [95% CI] = 4.233 [0.073, 8.393], P = 0.046) after adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and education level. In addition, there was a significantly positive correlation between the ALPS index and abdominal visceral adipose tissue area (r = 0.353, P = 0.020) after adjusting for age, sex, and BMI in NAFLD patients. NAFLD patients without cirrhosis showed significantly a reduced ALPS index compare to matched controls, indicating potential alterations in GS function. These alterations correlated with cognitive performance and clinical indicators, implying a possible link between GS function and cognitive performance in NAFLD that requires longitudinal validation.",2025,Oct,BMC psychiatry,Kun Shu; Shaoqing Chen; Shuang Meng; Yang Yang; Jiawen Song; Xiaoyan Huang; Xinjian Ye; Shihan Cui; Yongjin Zhou; Lu Han; Peng Wu; Zhihan Yan; Kun Liu,1981,True,2025-10-01

40146016,ALADDIN: A Machine Learning Approach to Enhance the Prediction of Significant Fibrosis or Higher in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"The recent US Food and Drug Administration approval of resmetirom for treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis in patients necessitates patient selection for significant fibrosis or higher (≥F2). No existing vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) algorithm targets ≥F2. The mAchine Learning ADvanceD fibrosis and rIsk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis Novel predictor (ALADDIN) study addressed this gap by introducing a machine-learning-based web calculator that estimates the likelihood of significant fibrosis using routine laboratory parameters with and without VCTE. Our study included a training set of 827 patients, a testing set of 504 patients with biopsy-confirmed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease from 6 centers, and an external validation set of 1,299 patients from 9 centers. Five algorithms were compared using area under the curve (AUC) in the test set: ElasticNet, random forest, gradient boosting machines, XGBoost, and neural networks. The top 3 (random forest, gradient boosting machines, and XGBoost) formed an ensemble model. In the external validation set, the ALADDIN-F2-VCTE model, using routine laboratory parameters with VCTE (AUC 0.791, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.764-0.819), outperformed VCTE alone (0.745, 95% CI 0.717-0.772, P < 0.0001), FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase (0.710, 0.679-0.748, P < 0.0001), and Agile-3 model (0.740, 0.710-0.770, P < 0.0001) regarding the AUC, decision curve analysis, and calibration. The ALADDIN-F2-Lab model, using routine laboratory parameters without VCTE, achieved an AUC of 0.706 (95% CI: 0.668-0.749) and outperformed Fibrosis-4, steatosis-associated fibrosis estimator, and LiverRisk scores. Along with the steatosis-associated fibrosis estimator model developed to target significant fibrosis or higher, ALADDIN-F2-VCTE ( https://aihepatology.shinyapps.io/ALADDIN1 ) uniquely supports a refined noninvasive approach to patient selection for resmetirom without the need for liver biopsy.

41103217,CircSMEK1 Suppresses HCC via the hnRNPK-IGF2-AKT Axis: A Diagnostic Biomarker and Therapeutic Target.,"The mechanism underlying metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is elusive, and whether circRNA can serve as biomarker or therapeutic target for MASH/HCC needs to be systematically explored. Integrative transcriptomic analysis of circRNA from MASH and HCC were performed. Multi-cohort analyses of serum and tissues from MASH and HCC patients (n = 206) were conducted. Mechanisms are explored via RNA-protein interaction assays, CRISPR-mediated knockdown, and xenograft/PiggyBac-mediated mice models. circSMEK1 is significantly decreased in MASH/HCC tissues and serum, correlating with tumor size, vascular invasion, and overall survival. Mechanistically, nuclear circSMEK1 binds hnRNPK, promoting its ubiquitin-mediated degradation, suppressing IGF2 transcription and PI3K/AKT signaling. Loss of circSMEK1 elevated autocrine IGF2 in HCC promoting tumor growth, also activated AKT in cancer-associated fibroblasts through paracrine, fostering an immunosuppressive microenvironment. SF3B4 overexpression drove circSMEK1 depletion in HCC. In murine models, circSMEK1 restoration inhibited tumor growth and metastasis. circSMEK1 is a tumor-suppressor in MASH/HCC through the hnRNPK-IGF2-AKT axis. The serum level of circSMEK1 has non-invasive diagnostic value for HCC (AUC = 0.790), as well as potential diagnostic utility for early HCC or high-risk MASH, owing to its key role in bridging MASH to HCC progression.

41107882,Stratifying cardiovascular benefits from GLP-1RA: a multisource analysis of patient-level CVOT and real-world data using AI-driven methods.,"It remains unclear whether certain individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) derive greater cardiovascular benefit from GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). Here, we integrate individual-level data from cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs) and electronic health records (EHRs), applying machine learning methods to confirm the cardiovascular benefits of GLP-1RAs in real-world populations and to identify subgroups with enhanced treatment response. Data from two CVOTs (LEADER and SUSTAIN-6) and a large real-world study (DARWIN-T2D) were analyzed. We first transposed the hazard ratio (HR) for 3-point major adverse cardiovascular event (3P-MACE) from CVOTs to the real-world population. Then, we used PRISM (Patient Response Identifiers for Stratified Medicine) against 3P-MACE reduction by GLP-1RA in a training/test setting. Findings were validated with external cohorts of new-users of GLP-1RA or comparators (DPP-4 inhibitors or basal insulin). Despite notable differences in clinical characteristics between CVOT and real-world patients, the real-world-transposed HRs for 3P-MACE closely paralleled those from CVOTs. PRISM identified subgroups with differential treatment responses, based on history of myocardial infarction (MI) or stroke and age. Participants aged over 71 years without MI/stroke (41% of the real-world population) had the greatest relative benefit (HR 0.46; 95% CI 0.24-0.89 in the test set) and a greater absolute risk reduction (ARR 4.5%, 95% CI 1.2-7.7) than other subgroups (Gail-Simon p = 0.02). The external validation cohort confirmed these results (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.51-0.89 and ARR 3.8%, 95% CI 1.5-6.1) showing significant differences in absolute risk reduction (p < 0.05). This study supports the integration of individual data from CVOT with those from EHR to confirm the transposition of results from CVOT to real-world populations, and enables the identification and validation of subgroups with greater cardiovascular benefits from cardioprotective treatment such as GLP-1RA treatment.

41150735,"Obesity as a Multifactorial Chronic Disease: Molecular Mechanisms, Systemic Impact, and Emerging Digital Interventions.","Obesity is a multifactorial chronic disease resulting from complex genetic, molecular, environmental, and behavioral interactions. Its prevalence rises worldwide, affecting cardiovascular, metabolic, oncological, hepatic, respiratory, and skeletal health. Beyond caloric excess, genetic predisposition, epigenetic modifications, gut microbiota dysbiosis, endocrine-disrupting agents, circadian misalignment, and intergenerational and prenatal influences are critical determinants of obesity risk. Core pathophysiological mechanisms include insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, chronic low-grade inflammation, and neuroendocrine dysregulation of appetite and energy balance. These processes are linked to comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes, hypertension, atherosclerosis, fatty liver disease, sleep apnea, osteoporosis, and cancer. Advances in molecular profiling, metabolic phenotyping, and body composition analysis are refining obesity classification and enabling precise risk stratification. Current therapeutic strategies include behavioral interventions addressing stress-related mechanisms, pharmacological therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, emerging gene therapy approaches, and bariatric surgery. Gut-derived hormones (leptin, ghrelin, GLP-1, PYY, CCK) are recognized as pivotal regulators of appetite and weight. Preventive strategies increasingly emphasize circadian alignment, while epigenetic inheritance and prenatal exposures such as maternal obesity or smoking highlight early-life programming in future metabolic health. Additionally, artificial intelligence-based platforms and personalized nutrition provide innovative opportunities for individualized prevention and management.

41145149,Headache and GLP-1 receptor agonists: when medications are therapeutic and when they contribute to the symptom.,"Obesity is a complex metabolic disorder with significant implications for both individual and public health. It has been strongly linked to chronic headache conditions, including migraines and idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH). Individuals with obesity who suffer from migraine are at increased risk of chronification, while weight reduction has been associated with improvement in IIH-related headaches, likely due to a decrease in cerebrospinal fluid pressure. These observations underscore the importance of weight management strategies as a therapeutic consideration in patients with obesity and headache disorders. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are pharmacological agents that mimic the hormone's endogenous activity. Analysis of selected studies highlights that these agents have emerged as a promising therapeutic option. The aim of this narrative review is to examine the role of GLP-1 RAs in the management of headaches, particularly in the context of IIH, migraine, and the gut-brain axis.

41135635,"Pin1 mediates metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis in mice fed high-fat, high-cholesterol diet by regulating both PPARα and acetyl CoA carboxylase.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has received increasing attention because of the increase in the number of affected patients. However, the mechanism underlying its onset is complicated and has not been completely elucidated. We recently reported increased Pin1 expression in the liver of patients with MASH. Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of hepatocyte Pin1 in MASH development. Hepatocyte-specific Pin1-knockout (H-Pin1 KO) and Pin1-flox (WT) littermates were fed a high-fat, high-cholesterol diet for 16 weeks. The WT mice showed remarkable obesity, steatosis, liver fibrosis, and liver injury. Conversely, the H-Pin1 KO mice exhibited mild symptoms. One explanation of these phenomena was that Pin1 interacted with acetyl CoA carboxylase (ACC) and increased its expressions in the liver without affecting its phosphorylation. In addition, RNA sequencing analysis revealed that Pin1 deficiency in hepatocytes promoted the pathway of fatty acid degradation, including peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) signaling in the livers. Indeed, we found that Pin1 silencing upregulated the expressions of PPARα-target genes in vitro and in vivo. Consistent with these results, Pin1 deficiency in hepatocytes elevated serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) concentrations, which is a representative target of PPARα, and serum beta-hydroxybutyrate produced by fatty acid oxidation. Importantly, we also reveal that Pin1 binds with PPARα, downregulating its transcription without affecting its expression levels or translocation. Taken together, our findings indicate that Pin1 acts as a critical mediator of MASH development by regulating both PPARα and ACC1. Hence, developing selective Pin1 inhibitors may be beneficial for treating MASH.",2025,Oct,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

The effects of resmetirom (80 or 100 mg) versus placebo were evaluated on Week 52 histological and biomarker endpoints in relation to background treatment with sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA), and/or ≥ 5% weight loss at Week 52. At baseline, 13%-17% of patients (all with type 2 diabetes mellitus [T2DM]) were on stable GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i therapy. Changes in liver histology, MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), and liver stiffness were examined after 52 weeks of treatment. No weight loss above baseline occurred with GLP-1 RA or SGLT2i therapy.

41132642,The Effect of Semaglutide on Gut Microbiota in Chinese Patients with Type 2 Diabetes Poorly Controlled by Metformin.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent metabolic disorder with increasing global incidence, linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis. This study investigated the effects of semaglutide, a long-acting GLP-1 receptor agonist, on gut microbiota composition and metabolic profiles in 15 Chinese patients with T2DM poorly controlled by metformin. Participants received semaglutide for 12 weeks, with fecal and blood samples collected before and after treatment. 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed significant changes in gut microbiota diversity and composition after semaglutide treatment. Alpha diversity indices increased, though not significantly, while beta diversity analysis showed structural shifts. At the phylum level, Firmicutes decreased, while Bacteroidota, Actinobacteriota and Proteobacteria increased. At the genus level, beneficial bacteria like Bifidobacterium increased, while potentially harmful genera like Klebsiella decreased. Metabolomic analysis identified 362 differentially expressed metabolites, with key pathways affected including Fc epsilon RI signaling, vascular smooth muscle contraction, and linoleic acid metabolism. Clinically, semaglutide improved glycemic control, reduced body weight, BMI and lipid. Significant correlations were observed between gut microbiota species, metabolites, and clinical indices such as BMI, HbA1c and lipid profiles. Taken together, this study suggested that semaglutide's therapeutic benefits may be mediated through modulation of the gut microbiota and associated metabolic pathways, highlighting the potential for targeting the gut microbiome in diabetes management.",2025,01,"Diabetes, metabolic syndrome and obesity : targets and therapy",Yanxia Chen; Yue Shan; Ting Wang; Zhihong Liu; Zhansheng Zhao; Yinxi He,1638,True,2025-01-01
41137469,Quantitative Approaches to Accelerate MASH Drug Discovery and Development.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a widespread liver condition that leads to cirrhosis, hepatic carcinoma, and increased mortality rates. In MASH, the diagnosis and accelerated approval of drugs are dependent on changes in histological endpoints; full approval requires lengthy outcomes trials. This requirement for biopsies complicates and constrains clinical development. While the use of noninvasive biomarkers to aid in diagnosis and prognosis is prevalent in MASH trials, interpretation of these data is not straightforward. Due to the complexity of the disease and heterogeneity of the patient population, a single biomarker may not fully capture the changes in the pathobiology with disease progression or with pharmacological interventions. No biomarker or collection of biomarkers can be used in lieu of histological evaluations for accelerated approval. These challenges may be mitigated in part through the application of quantitative approaches and model informed drug discovery and development (MID3). In this review, we demonstrate how MID3 approaches can be applied alone or together to facilitate decision making. For example, quantitative systems pharmacology (QSP) modeling can predict the physiological effects of MASH drugs and identify opportunities for combination therapy. Model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) can benchmark molecules in early development and aid in biomarker interpretation by establishing relationships between biomarkers and histological endpoints. Artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) methods can aid in the identification of participants that meet histological criteria and reduce screen failure rates.

This comprehensive narrative review synthesizes current evidence on the molecular mechanisms underlying obesity-induced memory dysfunction, drawing upon insights from in vivo and in vitro models alongside human clinical and neuroimaging studies. We explore how chronic adiposity triggers a cascade of neuropathological events, beginning with peripheral metabolic dysregulation that propagates to the central nervous system. Key mechanisms include neuroinflammation mediated by pro-inflammatory cytokines and activated microglia, oxidative stress through reactive oxygen species generation, dysregulation of apoptosis pathways, suppression of neurotrophic factors (notably BDNF), neurotransmitter system imbalances, and central insulin resistance. Critically, obesity profoundly impairs hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptogenesis-processes fundamental to memory encoding and consolidation. These pathways exhibit extensive crosstalk, creating self-amplifying cycles that accelerate synaptic loss, neuronal dysfunction, and network disorganization. Emerging therapeutic strategies targeting these mechanisms, including GLP-1 receptor agonists, intranasal insulin, and anti-inflammatory agents, show promise in preclinical and early clinical studies. This review underscores the multifaceted nature of obesity-related cognitive decline and highlights the urgent need for mechanistic, longitudinal human studies to translate these findings into effective clinical interventions against the growing burden of obesity-associated neurodegeneration.",2025,Oct,Physiology & behavior,Ahmad Golkar; Fateme Razazpour; Mohammad Dalfardi; Yousef Baghcheghi,1698,True,2025-10-01

40641101,Effects of Exercise Intervention in Subjects with Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a prevalent liver disorder globally, including in Asia-Pacific countries. In addition to contributing to severe liver disorders, MASLD increases the risk of various complications. Currently, resmetirom is the only U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for MASLD-related fibrosis in the United States. Therefore, lifestyle modifications, particularly regular exercise, remain a crucial approach in managing MASLD. Exercise is generally classified into two types: aerobic and resistance. The two forms offer benefits for individuals with MASLD, despite the difference between their effects and underlying mechanisms. Aerobic exercise is accessible, low cost, and promotes high energy expenditure, improving several MASLD-related clinical parameters. However, associated fatigue and discomfort can reduce long-term adherence. Resistance exercise, referring to muscle contractions performed to counteract external resistance, enhances muscle strength, muscle mass, and bone mineral density while also helping to correct metabolic derangement. It is especially suitable for subjects with MASLD who cannot conduct aerobic exercise or have poor cardiorespiratory function. Mechanistically, aerobic exercise enhances insulin sensitivity, while resistance exercise improves metabolic flexibility through adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase activation, muscle fiber adaptation, and muscle-liver cross-talk. In terms of aerobic training, traditional moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT) and high-intensity interval training (HIIT) have shown comparable benefits. This review is designed to offer refreshed perspectives on the advantages of exercise, compare the effects and mechanisms of aerobic and resistance exercise, and evaluate the advantages and disadvantages of MICT and HIIT, with emphasis on their impact on hepatic steatosis in subjects with MASLD.",2025,Jul,Journal of obesity & metabolic syndrome,Chieh Liu; Chun-Jen Liu,1954,True,2025-07-01
41136526,Cell type- and species-specific regulation of hepatic lncRNAs by TCDD-activated aryl hydrocarbon receptor.,"2,3,7,8-Tetrachlorodibenzio-p-dioxin (TCDD) is a persistent environmental contaminant known for aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AHR)-mediated liver effects, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)-like pathologies such as steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Although previous studies have focused on AHR-mediated regulation of protein-coding genes, recent attention has turned to long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) because of their potential roles in the progression of steatotic liver disease (SLD). Using bulk and single-nuclei (sn)RNAseq datasets, we compared the dose-dependent AHR-mediated induction of lncRNA and mRNA expression by TCDD in the mouse and rat liver. This study also investigated cell-specific lncRNA-gene regulation within the murine liver to identify divergent lncRNA expression patterns across different hepatic cell types. Lastly, differentially expressed (DE) lncRNAs associated with human liver diseases were examined to investigate potential mechanistic roles. Comparative analysis of gene expression identified 2,386 mouse and 916 rat DE lncRNAs, with 203 common to both species. In contrast, mice had 6,071 compared to 3,056 rat DE mRNAs, with 1,492 in common. Integration of AHR genomic enrichment and putative dioxin response elements (pDRE) data with DE lncRNAs revealed regulation patterns similar to mRNA-coding genes, with both exhibiting greater frequency proximal to the transcription start site in both mice and rats. snRNAseq analysis also revealed 5,495 DE lncRNAs across all liver cell subtypes. Pericentral and periportal hepatocytes exhibited the most significant changes, with 3,339 and 3,550 DE lncRNAs respectively, followed by macrophages with 2,116. Among all DE genes, 52 previously annotated lncRNAs in hepatocytes were differentially expressed by TCDD, many of which are associated with steatosis, fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Collectively, these results suggest AHR-mediated differential expression of lncRNAs may play a significant role in the progression of steatosis to steatohepatitis with fibrosis elicited by TCDD.",2025,Oct,Scientific reports,Gavin A Post; Giovan N Cholico; Rance Nault; Tim Zacharewski,2113,True,2025-10-01
41102420,Possible mechanisms of action of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists on blood pressure beyond body weight.,"Glucagon-like petide-1 (GLP-1) potentiates insulin and suppresses glucagon secretion from the pancreas in response to the ingestion of nutrients. Due to a short plasma half-life of native GLP-1, several synthesized GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) were developed for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) treatment. In clinical trials, GLP-1 RAs were shown to significantly lower blood pressure (BP) in addition to HbA1c and body weight (BW), indicating the possibility as anti-hypertensive medication of type 2 DM individuals. Although the hypotensive effect of GLP-1 RAs seems to be manifested by BW losing, other mechanisms not related to BW might be implied by the mediation meta-analysis, which suggests an existence of BW-independent hypotensive effect of GLP-1 RA, along with the clinical evidence of weak or no correlations, and difference in time course between BP lowering and BW reducing effects. Both human and animal studies reported inconsistent BP response to acute administration but showed hypotensive effect of chronic administration of GLP-1/ GLP-1 RAs. As for the mechanisms of hypotensive effect beyond BW, augmentation of natriuresis by inhibiting sodium hydrogen exchanger at proximal tubule, ameliorating angiotensin II activity, and enhancing vasodilation can be postulated. Since GLP-1 RAs improve both morning surge and nocturnal hypertension, they are expected as promising remedies for morning hypertension. GLP-1 RAs exert three properties, that are glucose, BW and BP lowering actions, all of which are expected to exert potent and coordinated effects for conquering noncommunicable diseases, including type 2 DM and hypertension.",2025,Oct,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,Masami Tanaka; Hiroshi Itoh,1651,True,2025-10-01

40178494,Early experience with resmetirom to treat metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with fibrosis in a real-world setting.,"Resmetirom was conditionally approved in the United States recently for treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with stage 2 and 3 fibrosis. However, its availability to patients requires preauthorization by the payors and is dispensed only through selected specialty pharmacies. We established a multistakeholder and multistep resmetirom prescription process pivoting to a dedicated pharmacist. It incorporates liver biochemistry testing at 12 weeks and liver clinic follow-up at 6 months after starting resmetirom. Fifteen hepatology providers prescribed resmetirom to 113 patients from April 1, 2024, to November 8, 2024, with histologic eligibility in 70% and noninvasive criteria in 30%. Resmetirom treatment was approved for 110 patients (97%), including 8 patients receiving the pharmaceutical company's patient assistance and 6 patients receiving bridge support to cover the co-pay. Eighty-three patients initiated resmetirom at an average of 30 days after its prescription. Adverse events were reported by 41% of patients taking resmetirom, and they were predominantly related to gastrointestinal symptoms and pruritus and/or rash with no evidence of hypersensitivity. Thirteen patients (16%) discontinued resmetirom after an average of 25.5 days (range: 2-68 d), with 11 patients discontinuing due to adverse events. The adverse events leading to discontinuation were nausea, diarrhea, and vomiting (n=4), right upper quadrant discomfort (n=2), left lower quadrant pain (n=1), rash with pruritus (n=1), pruritus and rash with indirect hyperbilirubinemia (n=1), dizziness (n=1), and mental fogginess (n=1). Follow-up liver biochemistries available in 24 patients showed no evidence of DILI. Our prescription pathway effectively dispensed resmetirom to nearly all patients who were prescribed resmetirom. One in 6 patients discontinued resmetirom, primarily due to side effects. This high discontinuation rate may be mitigated by modifying our follow-up from ""prescribe and forget"" to ""prescribe and closely follow.""",2025,Apr,Hepatology communications,Neel Ravela; Phoebe Shackelford; Nadia Blessing; Lindsay Yoder; Naga Chalasani; Niharika Samala,2043,True,2025-04-01

Clinical trials are investigating other promising molecules. However, this focus on pharmacotherapy may overshadow lifestyle interventions, which remain the cornerstone of MASLD management. A significant percentage of patients with MASLD struggle with an underlying eating disorder, often a precursor to obesity. The obesity pandemic, exacerbated by the increasing prevalence of binge eating, underscores the need for a psychological approach to address their common roots. We reviewed the current evidence on behavioral interventions for MASLD. Interventions such as self-monitoring, goal setting, and frequent counseling, have proven effective in achieving at least 5% weight loss. Cognitive behavioral therapy is the first-line treatment for eating disorders and has shown efficacy in treating binge eating and obesity. Further research is needed to establish the optimal behavioral therapy for MASLD, focusing on enhancing compliance and achieving sustained weight loss through diet and physical exercise. The treatment of MASLD should not rely solely on pharmacotherapy targeting a single-organ manifestation. Instead, we must consider behavioral interventions, emphasizing the pivotal role of a holistic approach to this multifaceted disorder.

41145714,Renoprotective effect of dulaglutide in L-NAME-induced hypertensive nephropathy in rats: insight into the roles of PPAR-gamma and VEGF.,"Hypertensive nephropathy (HTNeph), primarily triggered by vascular endothelial dysfunction, is the second most common cause of end-stage renal disease. This study investigates the ameliorative effect of dulaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, on HTNeph via its impact on renal vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma (PPARγ). The effect of dulaglutide (0.2 mg/kg/day, s.c.) for six weeks on L-NAME-induced hypertension (50 mg/kg/day, i.p.) was investigated in rats. Renal function biomarkers, serum IL-10 and TNF-α, tissue redox balance, histopathological and immunohistochemical changes, and PPARγ gene expression were assessed. Coadministration of dulaglutide with L-NAME could recover renal glomerular and vascular histological structure, reduce collagen deposition, increase the anti-inflammatory IL-10 and the reno-protective PPARγ level, elevate the immunohistochemical expression of the renal tubular eNOS and VEGF, and substantially reduce TNF-α activity in hypertensive rats. Our research linked dulaglutide's anti-inflammatory, antifibrotic, antioxidant, and vascular endothelium-promoting qualities to its capacity to upregulate VEGF and PPARγ, which confer its reno-protective effects. Thus, dulaglutide is presented as a potential candidate to shield patients from HTNeph. Dulaglutide ameliorates hypertensive nephropathy in rats via preserving renal function's biomarkers, restoring tissue redox balance, increasing the anti-inflammatory marker IL-10 and decreasing the inflammatory marker TNF-α, elevating the renoprotective PPARγ gene expression, amending renal vasculopathy and glomerular injury, decreasing fibrosis, and increasing the immunohistochemical expression of eNOS and VEGF.",2025,Oct,Hypertension research : official journal of the Japanese Society of Hypertension,Nermeen Bastawy; Aliaa E M K El-Mosallamy; Rabab Ahmed Rasheed; A S Sadek; R T Khattab; Esraa Ali; Randa A Zaghloul; Wael B A Ghaly; Amy F Boushra,1776,True,2025-10-01
41163285,Gut Microecosystem and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease: Exploring the Crosstalk and Advancing Therapeutic Strategies.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has emerged as a global health concern. In recent years, the gut microbiota, often referred to as the body's ""second genome,"" has been recognized as playing a crucial role in the pathogenesis of MASLD. PubMed was searched for articles published in the last decade using keywords like ""MASLD,"" ""NAFLD,"" ""gut microbiota,"" ""FXR,"" and ""Trace elements."" The progress of the latest NAFLD clinical trial was also reviewed from the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, organized by clinical phase. In the development of MASLD, the gut microbiota not only participates in regulating host gene expression but also exerts a core influence on immune function and affects the liver's reparative capabilities. Furthermore, the metabolic products of the gut microbiota are involved in the occurrence and development of liver diseases through the gut-liver axis. A diet high in fat can trigger metabolic inflammation, changes in gut microbiota, and abnormalities in metabolic products, all of which may initiate inflammatory responses. The emerging strategies for treating MASLD are surprising. Clinical trial information for chemical drugs was obtained from the Chinese platform for registration and disclosure of drug clinical trials, and it was found that in the current drug development, some drugs have advanced to Phase III clinical trials. The diversity of gut bacteria among individuals and the impact of microbial composition beyond bacteria should not be overlooked.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted to identify studies evaluating the association between GLP-1RAs and psychiatric outcomes. The electronic databases systematically searched were PubMed/MEDLINE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase and Web of Science. GLP-1RAs are increasingly recognised for their potential neuropsychiatric effects beyond glycaemic control and weight loss. Findings suggest modest antidepressant effects, inconsistent associations with suicidality and potential therapeutic benefit in disorders of reward regulation. These findings are constrained by limited sample diversity, variability in outcome measures and the consistent underrepresentation of individuals with psychiatric comorbidities, factors that warrant targeted future research. This review highlights key findings on the neuropsychiatric effects of GLP-1RAs. The heterogeneity among the studies in terms of dosing, clinical indications and baseline psychiatric status complicates interpretation, but preliminary evidence suggests modest antidepressant effects and potential therapeutic roles in eating and SUD. Concerns regarding suicidality remain unresolved.

Therefore, this study aims to investigate the pharmacovigilance signal between antidiabetic drug use and infection risk, considering the number and patterns of drug use. This study evaluated the pharmacovigilance signal between antidiabetic drug use and infection utilizing the global pharmacovigilance database. To account for adverse events from multiple drug use, we restructured the database at the individual level using a unique demographic identifier, allowing assessment of infection risk by drug combination and count. Antidiabetic drugs include metformin, sulfonylureas, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, and insulin, with infections categorized by the system. The pharmacovigilance signal of adverse drug reactions was estimated using adjusted reporting odds ratios (aRORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) through multivariable logistic regression. SGLT2 inhibitor users reported the highest frequency of infections (n = 13,570), followed by insulin (n = 11,322) and GLP-1 RAs (n = 5966). When analyzing only monotherapy, excluding combination use, urinary tract infections were significantly linked solely to SGLT2 inhibitors (aROR, 10.41 [95% CI, 9.76-11.09]), while hepatobiliary and pancreatic infections were associated with DPP-4 inhibitors (aROR, 1.72 [95% CI, 1.28-2.31]), with no significant pharmacovigilance signal observed for other drug classes. Compared to monotherapy, combination therapy with two drugs (aROR, 1.24 [95% CI, 1.20-1.29]) or three or more drugs (aROR, 1.42 [95% CI, 1.13-1.79]) was associated with infection. Although the results from disproportionality analysis did not indicate causal relationship, our findings indicate that infection types vary between monotherapy and combination therapy, highlighting the need for further investigation into these pharmacovigilance signal due to the increased susceptibility of individuals with diabetes.",2025,Sep,Scientific reports,Tae Hyeon Kim; Kyeongmin Lee; Seoyoung Park; Jaeyu Park; Hyesu Jo; Hayeon Lee; Hyunjee Kim; Jaehyeong Cho; Sang Youl Rhee; André Hajek; Francesco Branda; Tae-Jin Song; Jaewon Kim; Dong Keon Yon,2225,True,2025-09-01

We performed a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to examine the efficacy of GLP-1RAs in treating MASLD or MASH. We systematically searched three electronic databases from inception until April 2025 to identify RCTs examining the efficacy of GLP-1RAs for the treatment of MASLD or MASH. The outcome measures included MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis or improvement in at least one stage of fibrosis without worsening of MASH, along with reductions in liver fat content measured using magnetic resonance-based techniques. Meta-analysis was conducted using random-effects models. We identified 13 phase 2 or phase 3 RCTs (1811 participants). These trials diagnosed MASLD or MASH through liver biopsy (n = 4) or magnetic resonance-based techniques (n = 9). Regardless of diabetes status, among individuals with MASH and moderate-to-advanced fibrosis, GLP-1RAs (especially semaglutide 2.4 mg/week) for up to 72 weeks were superior to placebo in achieving MASH resolution (n = 3 RCTs; pooled random-effects odds ratio 3.48, 95% CI 2.69-4.51; I GLP-1RAs are a promising treatment option for MASLD or MASH.

To address these issues, we developed a fully active pharmaceutical ingredient (API)-based nanodrug designed for synergistic MASH therapy through three integrated mechanisms: dual modulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) homeostasis via endogenous and exogenous pathways, mitigation of pathological lipid accumulation, and suppression of inflammatory cascades. The nanodrug (QRDP) system utilizes arginine-modified polydopamine as both a nanocarrier and intrinsic antioxidant and codelivery of quercetin and the mitochondrial uncoupler 2,4-dinitrophenol. QRDP eliminates more than 80% of ROS and increases hepatic glutathione levels by 1.5-fold through exogenous antioxidant delivery and endogenous ROS suppression via regulating mitochondrial proton channels. Additionally, QRDP-mediated mitochondrial uncoupling reduced intracellular lipid overload by 90% through inhibition of ATP synthesis, accompanied by significant decreases in serum total cholesterol (39%), triglycerides (30%), and free fatty acids (59%). Furthermore, QRDP significantly downregulated pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-6, and IL-1β) in vitro and in vivo, while restoring anti-inflammatory markers (Arg-1 and IL-10) to over 78% of baseline levels. In high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MASH mice, QRDP treatment not only attenuated hepatic fibrosis and normalized liver function but also provided substantial protection against lipotoxicity.

41052689,Nelumbinis Plumula attenuates high-fat-induced inflammation in non-alcoholic fatty liver through the NOX/NF-κB pathway.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent chronic hepatic metabolic disorder and represents a major public health concern worldwide. Nelumbinis Plumula, a traditional Chinese herbal medicine, has attracted significant interest given its high concentration of alkaloids and flavonoids, known to modulate lipid metabolism (LM) and exert antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Although its extract ENP has been reported to govern LM, the mechanism remains unclear. To investigate whether ENP could ameliorate hepatic inflammation and free fatty acid (FFA)-induced lipid deposition in NAFLD models and to explore the mechanisms underlying its therapeutic effects. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) was used to identify the major constituents of ENP. NAFLD was modeled in vivo by feeding mice a high-fat diet (HFD) for 20 weeks and in vitro by exposing AML12 cells to FFA. ENP was administered at various doses to evaluate its pharmacodynamic effects. Network pharmacology combined with metabolomics was applied to identify potential targets and signaling pathways, and these findings were further validated in the above NAFLD models to assess ENP's efficacy in regulating LM. Four alkaloids and eight flavonoids were identified as the primary active compounds of ENP. In mice, ENP administration significantly attenuated HFD-induced increases in body weight, epididymal fat, liver hypertrophy, and histopathological damage, while improving LM and liver function. Integrated network pharmacology and metabolomics analyses revealed that the modulation of oxidative stress and inflammatory pathways, particularly through the NF-κB signaling cascade, was central to ENP's therapeutic effects. Consistently, ex vivo experiments revealed that ENP restored lipid metabolic balance in NAFLD models by suppressing inflammation via the NOX/NF-κB signaling pathway.

Compared with the ++ genotype, the differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) in the semen of B+ genotype rams are significantly involved in the biological process of innate immune response and are significantly enriched in the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in KEGG analysis. From a biological perspective, the innate immune response may affect the immune health of Duolang sheep, while oxidative phosphorylation influences energy metabolism, which in turn impacts reproductive performance. Compared with the BB genotype, the DEPs in the semen of B+ genotype rams participate in biological processes such as protein phosphorylation and protein hydrolysis during cellular protein catabolism. These DEPs are also significantly enriched in pathways related to Parkinson's disease and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in KEGG analysis. These differences may affect the cellular metabolism and physiological functions of Duolang sheep, thereby being associated with their reproductive performance. Compared with the ++ genotype, the DEPs in the semen of BB genotype rams exhibit differences in molecular function, cellular component, KEGG pathway, domain function, and subcellular localization.

39938598,Insights into the results of Resmetirom trials: Can a thyroid hormone receptor agonist be the holy grail of MASH therapy?,"Despite the heavy individual patient and socioeconomic burden of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), until recently, no pharmacological therapy for MASH was approved, with available treatment options geared towards associated cardiometabolic risk factors. Accelerated approval of resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist to be used in conjunction with diet and exercise, marks a significant step forward in the treatment of MASH, offering tempered optimism to healthcare providers and millions of patients around the world for more effective management. Evidence from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials suggests that resmetirom has the potential to alleviate hepatic fibrosis and inflammation and significantly reduce liver lipid content. Notwithstanding this landmark event, the clinical implementation of resmetirom comes with important challenges, for example, ensuring patient access to treatment and demonstrating effects on hard MASH-related outcomes, such as progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Additional considerations include the evaluation of co-administration with other hepatoprotective treatments and the assessment of the efficacy in specific MASH sub-phenotypes. Furthermore, the accumulation of real-world data and experience is expected to help answer the remaining questions about the (long-term) effectiveness and safety profile of the drug.

39002641,"Effect of pemvidutide, a GLP-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist, on MASLD: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.","This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the effects of pemvidutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/glucagon dual receptor agonist, on liver fat content (LFC) in individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Patients with a BMI ≥28.0 kg/m Ninety-four patients were randomized and dosed. Median baseline BMI and LFC across the study population were 36.2 kg/m In patients with MASLD, weekly pemvidutide treatment yielded significant reductions in LFC, markers of hepatic inflammation, and body weight compared to placebo. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and its progressive form steatohepatitis, are strongly associated with overweight/obesity and it is believed that the excess liver fat associated with obesity is an important driver of these diseases. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists elicit weight loss through centrally and peripherally mediated effects on appetite. Unlike GLP-1R agonists, glucagon receptor agonists act directly on the liver to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and inhibit lipogenesis, potentially providing a more potent mechanism for liver fat content reduction than weight loss alone. This study demonstrated the ability of once-weekly treatment with pemvidutide, a dual GLP-1R/glucagon receptor agonist, to significantly reduce liver fat content, hepatic inflammatory activity, and body weight, suggesting that pemvidutide may be an effective treatment for both metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and obesity.

A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, MEDLINE, and Embase through May 31, 2025, identifying relevant preclinical and clinical studies examining GLP-1RAs and male reproductive health. The search strategy identified 16 clinical studies meeting our inclusion criteria, and these studies were included in the summary tables for review. GLP-1 receptors are present in male reproductive tissues. Preclinical studies indicate GLP-1RAs enhance spermatogenesis, hormone profiles, and sperm function in obese/diabetic rodent models via cAMP/PKA and PI3K/Akt pathways. In vitro data show improved sperm motility and Sertoli cell metabolism with GLP-1RAs. Limited clinical studies suggest potential improvements in semen parameters and testosterone levels in obese hypogonadal men, though heterogeneous results highlight the need for further research. GLP-1RAs likely have a beneficial effect on male fertility, particularly in the setting of metabolic dysfunction, but clinical evidence is limited.

40987589,"Association between GLP-1 receptor agonist use and neurosurgical intervention in patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension and obesity: a propensity-matched, multi-institutional, cohort study.","Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is characterized by elevated intracranial pressure and most commonly affects obese women. While its etiology remains unclear, many patients require ventriculoperitoneal shunting (VPS) for symptoms. In those with transverse sinus stenosis, venous sinus stenting (VSS) is an alternative. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been associated with reduced headache burden and visual symptoms in IIH. Since GLP-1 RAs reach steady state around 5 weeks and can produce 10% weight loss by 6 months, we evaluated their impact on neurosurgical/neurovascular procedures at these time points. Our retrospective cohort study utilized TriNetX Research Network to compare IIH patients treated with GLP-1 RAs to untreated controls. Propensity score matching balanced demographics, comorbidities, and medication use before comparing odds of neurosurgical interventions, including VSS, VPS, and optic nerve sheath fenestration (ONSF) at ≥5 weeks and ≥6 months after GLP-1 RA initiation. Odds ratios (OR) were estimated via a generalized linear model. After propensity matching, 2690 patients were included in each group. GLP-1 RA use was linked to lower odds of undergoing VSS at 5 weeks (OR 2.40; CI: 1.44 to 4.00; P GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with lower odds of neurosurgical intervention in IIH patients.

37520754,"Solubility determination, dissolution properties and solid transformation of resmetirom (form A) in heptane and seven alcohols.","In this work, the solubility of resmetirom (form A) was initially measured in heptane and seven alcohol solvents by gravimetric methods. Then, the transformation temperature between form A and ethanol solvate was determined at 333.76 K. Subsequently, some commonly used models were applied to fit the solubility data, and it was found that the modified Apelblat equation and the Jouyban-Acree-van't Hoff (J-A-V) model achieved the highest correlation accuracy for those in mono-solvents and heptane + propanol, respectively. And the average relative deviation (ARD) values of models were less than 0.5%, indicating a good agreement with the experimental results. Additionally, through density functional theory calculation and the analysis of solvent parameters, it was observed that hydrogen-bonding played primary roles in the dissolution process of resmetirom. The multiple factors such as the polarity of solvent, active site interaction, the molecular size and free volume all affect the solubility of resmetirom. Furthermore, by comparing the experimental and simulated infrared spectra of form A and two alcohol solvates, five characteristic bands were selected for quantification. Partial least squares regression (PLSR), a multivariate statistical analysis method, was used to extract quantitative information. The quantitative analysis model was established based on specific wavelength intervals, which were associated with inter-molecular interactions. Combined with PLSR, a new high-precision quantitative method was established to study the solid transformation process between form A and solvates. From 303.15 to 323.15 K, the rate of transformation from form A to methanol solvate or ethanol solvate was decreased with increasing temperature, revealing that the transformation process was driven by the solubility difference between form A and solvates under the studied conditions. This research will definitely afford necessary solubility data and solvent selection for the design of the crystallization process of resmetirom (form A) in industry, and provide basic data for the production of resmetirom (form A) in the pharmaceutical industry.",2023,Jul,RSC advances,Chang Liu; Yue Xu; Haikuan Yuan; Guangxin Tian; Xiaolan Qin; Boxuan Lou; Xijian Liu; Lijuan Zhang; Jie Lu,2163,True,2023-07-01

39159948,Epidemiology of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"As the rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) continue to increase globally, so does the prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Currently, 38% of all adults and 7-14% of children and adolescents have MASLD. By 2040, the MASLD prevalence rate for adults is projected to increase to more than 55%. Although MASLD does not always develop into progressive liver disease, it has become the top indication for liver transplant in the United States for women and those with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Nonetheless, the most common cause of mortality among patients with MASLD remains cardiovascular disease. In addition to liver outcomes (cirrhosis and HCC), MASLD is associated with an increased risk of developing de novo T2D, chronic kidney disease, sarcopenia, and extrahepatic cancers. Furthermore, MASLD is associated with decreased health-related quality of life, decreased work productivity, fatigue, increased healthcare resource utilization, and a substantial economic burden. Similar to other metabolic diseases, lifestyle interventions such as a heathy diet and increased physical activity remain the cornerstone of managing these patients. Although several obesity and T2D drugs are available to treat co-morbid disease, resmetirom is the only MASH-targeted medication for patients with stage 2-3 fibrosis that has approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in the United States. This review discusses MASLD epidemiology and its related risk factors and outcomes and demonstrates that without further global initiatives, MASLD incidence could continue to increase.",2025,Feb,Clinical and molecular hepatology,Zobair M Younossi; Markos Kalligeros; Linda Henry,1630,True,2025-02-01
40859753,Corrected T1 (cT1) is the most appropriate diagnosis and monitoring tool for widespread adoption of resmetirom treatment in the United States.,"The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recently approved the first treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), resmetirom, without clarifying the most effective strategy for diagnosing or monitoring response to therapy. Current standards-of-care (SoC) for Veterans Health Administration (VHA) and Medicare patients largely rely on vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) and/or liver biopsy. Multiparametric MRI corrected T1 (cT1) is a cost-effective, noninvasive liver disease assessment (NILDA) tool in MASH. We evaluated the budgetary impact of pathways using cT1 versus SoC (liver biopsy or VCTE) to assign suspected MASH patients to resmetirom and for those assigned treatment, monitor response. A model of the VHA and Medicare populations was used to derive a budget impact comparing cT1, VCTE and liver biopsy. Clinical and cost data were taken from publicly available sources and used to estimate the number of patients prescribed resmetirom, the identification of those benefiting from therapy, the budgetary impact of each diagnosis and monitoring strategy and the cost of medication prescribed. For the VHA, cT1 resulted in the lowest per-patient costs ($7,022 (cT1) vs $7,268 (liver biopsy) vs $28,509 (VCTE)), with results remaining consistent across scenario analyses. In the Medicare population, cT1 also resulted in the lowest per-patient costs ($11,866 (cT1) vs $15,488 (biopsy) vs $27,539 (VCTE)) and these results also remained consistent across scenario analyses. The use of cT1 to assign and monitor resmetirom treatment improves treatment allocation and reduces health system cost vs VCTE and liver biopsy. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a form of liver disease that can progress to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). MASH is a very serious liver disease that can lead to liver scarring, heart disease and liver transplantation. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved the first treatment for MASH, resmetirom. There are no guidelines for the best monitoring strategies, which can lead to increased healthcare costs. This work estimated the budget impact of a noninvasive MRI metric, cT1, for assigning patients to resmetirom treatment and monitoring them. Using this metric was found to be less costly and more accurate than an ultrasound-based alternative (vibration controlled transient elastography), and less costly and similarly accurate to liver biopsy, which is an expensive and invasive tool. Using a noninvasive diagnosis and monitoring pathway with cT1 may lead to a better allocation of medication and healthcare resources.

Recent studies have shown the relevance of microRNAs (miRNAs) as potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets in MASLD. This bibliometric review aimed to evaluate the scientific production of the last decade on miRNAs involved in the pathophysiology and diagnosis of MASLD. A total of 775 articles were initially retrieved from the PubMed database, with 51 meeting the inclusion criteria after a systematic screening process. Bibliometric analysis showed that China and the United States had the highest number of publications, with studies published mainly by the International Journal of Molecular Sciences and Hepatology. Among the most studied miRNAs were miR-122, miR-29a, miR-34a, and miR-223, which participate in lipid metabolism, inflammation, fibrosis, and insulin sensitivity. Co-authorship network analysis identified Gao Bin as the most influential author in the field. Keyword co-occurrence analysis showed growing interest in miRNAs in general, miR-29a, miR-34a, miR-122, miR-223, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, lipogenesis, and mitochondrial stress in recent years. This review emphasizes the increasing scientific attention on miRNAs involved in MASLD and highlights their diagnostic and therapeutic potential.

41059433,Effect of metformin on cell proliferation and apoptosis in steatosis HepG2 cell model.,"Metformin, which is commonly recommended drug for managing type II diabetes, has been reported to have anti-cancer properties and may improve the prognosis of some malignancies. Epidemiology studies have shown improved survival in cancer patients using metformin. However, the mechanism behind this phenomenon remains incompletely understood. In our study, Our objective was to investigate how metformin influences the proliferation and apoptosis of hepatocellular carcinoma cells induced with steatosis via palmitic acid and oleic acid. We established an in vitro cellular model of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by inducing lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells through the use of oleic acid and palmitic acid. Oil Red O staining was conducted to observe the distribution of intracellular lipid droplets. Cell proliferation were detected using the BrdU cell proliferation detection kit. Protein expressions were detected by western blot method techniques. We found that metformin reduced cell proliferation in palmitic acid and oleic acid-induced HepG2 cells compared to the control group. Moreover, our western blot data show that metformin treatment changes apoptosis. Our results show that metformin inhibits cell viability of steatosis HepG2 cells. These findings may be preliminary for new studies in steatosis HepG2 cells and may provide new therapeutic targets or treatment strategies against hepatocellular carcinoma.",2025,01,Northern clinics of Istanbul,Ayse Melek Tanriverdi Bademci; Banu Aydin; Hulya Cabadak,1427,True,2025-01-01

During the pathological progression of liver diseases, aberrant alterations in epitranscriptomic modifications can disrupt the dynamic equilibrium of PCD signaling pathways, leading to excessive cell death or abnormal survival of hepatocytes, thereby driving the development of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), viral hepatitis, alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD), hepatic fibrosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A thorough investigation into the molecular mechanisms of epitranscriptomic modifications in PCD pathways and their roles in liver diseases not only aids in elucidating the pathogenesis of liver disorders but also holds the potential to provide new biomarkers and therapeutic targets for the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of liver diseases. This review systematically summarizes the molecular mechanisms of epitranscriptomic modifications, delves into the complex regulatory networks between epitranscriptomic modifications and PCD, elaborates on their roles in liver diseases, and provides a comprehensive overview of current drugs targeting epitranscriptomic modifications.

However, the precise molecular mechanisms remain unclear. This study explores the roles of noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD)/miR-511-3p/Rho-associated protein kinase 2 (Rock2) axis and the NORAD/ROCK2 interaction in the development of MASLD. In vitro and in vivo models of MASLD were created using high-fat diet-fed mice and free fatty acid (FFA)-treated hepatocytes. To examine the relationships between NORAD, miR-511-3p, and ROCK2, we employed bioinformatics, luciferase assays, RNA immunoprecipitation, and biotinylated NORAD pull-down assays. MASLD progression was assessed based on food intake, energy expenditure, insulin resistance, hepatic steatosis, inflammation, white fat growth, and liver fibrosis. NORAD and ROCK2 were upregulated, while miR-511-3p was downregulated in MASLD liver tissues and FFA-treated hepatocytes. Mechanistically, NORAD competitively interacted with miR-511-3p to modulate Rock2 mRNA expression, and directly stabilized ROCK2 protein by abrogating its ubiquitination degradation. Functionally, liver-specific knockdown of NORAD or overexpression of miR-511-3p significantly slowed MASLD progression. Overexpression of NORAD or ROCK2 partially reversed miR-511-3p-induced inhibition of MASLD. Additionally, ROCK2 knockdown attenuated NORAD-induced worsening of MASLD. Moreover, overexpressing NORAD or ROCK2 or interfering miR-511-3p influenced resmetirom treatment to suppress MASLD development. Finally, metabolic changes in liver driven by the NORAD/miR-511-3p/Rock2 axis and NORAD/ROCK2 interaction also influenced white adipose growth, pancreatic β-cell dedifferentiation, and liver fibrosis. The NORAD/miR-511-3p/Rock2 axis and the NORAD/ROCK2 interaction play critical roles in MASLD progression, identifying potential therapeutic targets for its treatment.",2025,Mar,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,Xu Zhang; Tianxing Chen; Zhenhan Li; Lingfeng Wan; Zhihang Zhou; Ying Xu; Dong Yan; Wei Zhao; Hao Chen,1930,True,2025-03-01

The dependencies of elastography-derived hepatic steatosis and fibrosis measures with chronic inflammation, disease states, and physiological determinants of drug dosing (PDODD) were assessed. Liver elastography data for n = 5494 participants (50% female, 12-80 years) were obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and median liver stiffness (LSM) elastography metrics were used to assess steatosis and fibrosis, and their associations with over 50 key organ systems, disease, and PDODD biomarkers were evaluated with statistical regression, ensemble, and Bayesian learning methods. CAP and LSM increased with age and were greater in males, active liver disease, active hepatitis C, and diabetes or prediabetes. LSM was greater in the presence of congestive heart failure and dialysis. The inflammatory markers C-reactive protein (CRP) and ferritin, body surface area, and hepatic R-value were greater in steatosis and fibrosis. Plasma volume, neutrophil, red blood cell, and platelet counts were greater in steatosis. Drug-induced liver injury index was lower in steatosis and greater in fibrosis. Albumin levels and platelet counts were lower, but the urine albumin-to-creatine ratio was greater in fibrosis. Ensemble learning identified interactions among BMI, age, CRP, ferritin, and liver enzymes contributing to steatosis and fibrosis. Bayesian networks were used to identify directed acyclic graph structures for steatosis and fibrosis.

41065947,Current Perspectives on GLP-1 Agonists in Contemporary Clinical Practice from Science and Mechanistic Foundations To Optimal Translation.,"This review provides a comprehensive and scholarly examination of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists, tracing their evolution from glycemic control agents in diabetes mellitus (DM) to multifaceted therapeutics with expanding indications in cardiovascular, renal, and metabolic health. We explore the underlying biological mechanisms, summarize clinical trial evidence, and highlight emerging applications in non-diabetic populations. Recent developments underscore the relevance of GLP-1R agonists in addressing the complex interplay of cardiovascular-kidney-metabolic (CKM) syndrome, microvascular dysfunction, and metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). We also discuss combination therapies and strategies to mitigate muscle mass loss during treatment and calls for targeted research, improved clinical education, and policy reforms to optimize the translational potential of GLP-1R agonists in both individualized care and population health. Diabetes mellitus currently affects over 422 million individuals worldwide, with projections indicating a rise to 783 million by 2045, representing 10.5% of the global adult population. Common comorbidities include chronic kidney disease (CKD) and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), which collectively impact nearly one-third of individuals with DM. The growing prevalence of metabolic disease, CKD, and ASCVD have prompted investigation into the role of GLP-1R agonists in mitigating cardiovascular and metabolic risks, particularly within the framework of Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic (CKM) Syndrome, irrespective of diabetic status. Emerging evidence, foundational science, and transformative knowledge of mechanisms of action further support the expansion of therapeutic indications for this drug class. Although GLP-1R agonists were originally developed for glycemic control in DM, their mechanistic versatility has enabled broader application across a spectrum of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and metabolic disorders. This review traces the trajectory of their development and highlights opportunities for more expansive translational use in both clinical and population health settings. We also address current barriers to implementation and evidence-based use, ongoing clinical trials, and future directions, including combination therapies that may enhance efficacy and patient outcomes.",2025,Oct,Current atherosclerosis reports,Husam Abu-Nejim; Richard C Becker,2383,True,2025-10-01
41015576,Crosstalk between alcohol use disorder and obesity: two sides of the same coin?,"Investigating similarities and differences between alcohol use disorder (AUD) and obesity is important because both AUD and obesity are public health concerns and share neurobiological and periphery-brain mechanisms. Furthermore, AUD and obesity often present with similar medical consequences related to organ damage, including liver and cardiovascular diseases. There is also growing evidence of changes in alcohol drinking in people who undergo bariatric surgery for obesity. In this non-systematic critical review, we identified relevant articles through PubMed searches, previous knowledge, and recursive reference searching. A librarian also used PubMed and Google Scholar for additional relevant articles, using terms such as alcohol, metabolic disorders, obesity, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), bariatric surgery, and gut-brain axis. We provide an overview of the neurobiological, pathophysiological, neuroimaging, and clinical features related to the overlap and crosstalk between AUD and obesity. We also provide a summary of the currently approved medications for obesity and those for AUD and note the potential for some of these medications to work for both disorders. Specific to the latter point, we place emphasis on GLP-1 therapies, given their recent approval for weight loss and the growing evidence suggesting their potential efficacy for AUD and other addictions. We further review studies of the relationship between bariatric surgery and AUD and discuss potential mechanisms and future directions. In summary, studying the overlap between obesity and AUD may shed light on the mechanisms underlying the development and maintenance of both diseases. This knowledge, in turn, may help identify new therapeutic targets for AUD, and possibly comorbid obesity and/or other metabolic disorders.",2025,Sep,Molecular psychiatry,Lorenzo Leggio; Mehdi Farokhnia; Paul J Kenny; Marta Yanina Pepino; W Kyle Simmons,1814,True,2025-09-01
40996059,Intestinal bitter taste receptors in health: a multifactorially regulated role from the perspective of metabolic crosstalk.,"Intestinal bitter taste receptors (TAS2Rs) play a crucial role in detecting bitter compounds and regulating the release of intestinal hormones, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), and gastric emptying, which influence appetite, satiety, food intake, and energy balance. TAS2Rs are considered potential therapeutic targets for various diseases. However, TAS2Rs may interact with other taste receptors in the gut, affecting disease progression. This interaction may occur because intestinal TAS2Rs and other taste receptors share the same signaling pathways and activate similar signal transduction proteins. TAS2R expression is influenced by genetic factors, gut microbiota (GM), age, and sex. External chemical factors can also alter TAS2R expression, potentially leading to metabolic disorders and other diseases. Future studies should comprehensively assess how interventions affect the complex balance between taste reception and metabolic response. This review summarizes the role of TAS2Rs in metabolic processes and their potential interactions with other taste receptors, paving the way for precision nutrition.",2025,Sep,Critical reviews in food science and nutrition,Jiafan Liang; Jiahui Chen; Guoping Zhao; Yanbo Wang,1124,True,2025-09-01

We aimed to determine the impact of GLP-1 based therapies on incident AUDs in a real-world setting in patients with T2D. We conducted emulation target trials based on a real-world network of electronic health records (EHRs) from over 120 million patients in the United States of America. Four target trials were emulated among eligible patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) who had no prior AUD diagnosis by comparing tirzepatide, semaglutide, liraglutide, and dulaglutide with DPP4 inhibitors (DPP4i). First-ever diagnosis of AUD occurred within an 18-month follow-up period and was examined using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Four target trial cohorts were generated and compared with a reference arm of patients treated with DPP4i: cohort (1) treatment with tirzepatide; cohort (2) treatment with semaglutide; cohort (3) treatment with liraglutide; and cohort (4) treatment with dulaglutide. Cohorts underwent propensity score matching 1:1 for confounders. We examined rates of incident AUD (ICD-10 code F10) and performed head-to-head analyses of the incretin-based therapies. We also performed sensitivity analyses relating to whether treatment was adjunctive therapy with metformin and by treatment adherence. After propensity-score matching, we identified four target trials of patients treated with tirzepatide (n = 7165), semaglutide (n = 20 198), liraglutide (n = 6565), and dulaglutide (n = 19 061); 1:1 with the reference (DPP4i) patients. Tirzepatide and semaglutide (but not liraglutide or dulaglutide) were associated with significant risk reduction of incident AUD compared to DPP4i (hazard ratio 0.47 [95% confidence interval 0.29, 0.75] and 0.68 [0.52, 0.89], respectively). Head-to-head comparison revealed tirzepatide had a significant risk reduction compared to liraglutide in incident AUD (0.47 [0.24, 0.92]). In patients with T2D, tirzepatide and semaglutide treatment is associated with a lower incidence of AUD; robust randomised, controlled evidence for the use of these drugs for this novel indication is appropriate.",2025,Oct,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Alex E Henney; David R Riley; Megan Heague; Carl A Roberts; Theresa J Hydes; Matthew Anson; David M Hughes; Uazman Alam; Daniel J Cuthbertson,2247,True,2025-10-01
41068024,Neuroimmune Regulation for Acute Kidney Injury Therapy: Insights Along the Path From Bench to Bedside.,"Over the past 25 years, neuroimmune regulation has emerged as a compelling approach to the prevention and treatment of acute kidney injury. Vagus nerve stimulation through the cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway can suppress inflammatory responses and demonstrate therapeutic potential in both animal disease models and a variety of human inflammatory conditions. The mechanisms underlying this neuroimmune-regulated protection are complex, but research undertaken since 2000 has significantly advanced our understanding of the key elements involved. This research has also yielded intriguing results and unexpected observations. In this review, we highlight current insights into vagus nerve-mediated neuroimmune regulation, areas of ongoing uncertainty, and promising directions for therapeutic modulation in AKI.

41072556,"The Impact of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist Use on Clinical Outcomes After Total Hip and Knee Arthroplasty: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of 346,899 Patients.","Obesity and diabetes are highly prevalent comorbidities in patients undergoing total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasty (TKA). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are novel agents that promote weight loss and glycemic control, assisting with perioperative optimization and potentially improving clinical outcomes. However, there have been safety concerns surrounding GLP-1RA use due to delayed gastric emptying and increased aspiration risk. The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the impact of GLP-1RA usage on perioperative outcomes following THA and TKA. PubMed (Medline), Scopus (Embase, Medline, and Compendex), and Cochrane databases were queried to conduct a systematic review of articles from inception to June 2025. A total of 13 studies were included (119,092 hip, 227,381 knee, and 426 hip or knee). Demographics, surgical complications, medical complications, resource utilization, and revision rates were recorded at 90 days and at one and two years. Meta-analysis was performed using a random-effects model. The GLP-1RA use was associated with a lower risk of 90-days PJI following TKA (odds ratio (OR), 0.75; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.57 to 1.00; P = 0.047) and a lower risk of 90-day revision following THA (OR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.98; P = 0.034). There was a significant decrease in 90-day readmission rates for TKA and THA with GLP-1RA use. Of note, no significant association was found between GLP-1RA use and aspiration or pneumonia (OR, 1.09; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.67; P = 0.70), but GLP-1RA usage was associated with an elevated risk of myocardial infarction in the setting of TKA (OR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.85; P = 0.02). The GLP-1RA use was associated with improved early surgical outcomes and decreased resource utilization following THA and TKA. These findings suggest a potential benefit of GLP-1RA use for optimizing high-risk patients who have obesity or diabetes undergoing total joint arthroplasty.",2025,Oct,The Journal of arthroplasty,Seungjun Lee; Kevin Singh; Sean C Clark; Graham S Goh,1967,True,2025-10-01
39028914,Comparative efficacy of pharmacologic therapies for MASH in reducing liver fat content: Systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a leading cause of liver disease. Dynamic changes in MRI proton-density-fat fraction (PDFF) are associated with MASH resolution. We aimed to determine the relative efficacy of therapeutic agents for reducing hepatic fat, assessed by MRI-PDFF. In this systematic review and network meta-analysis, we searched MEDLINE and Embase from inception until December 26, 2023, for published randomized controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions in patients with MASH that assessed changes in MRI-PDFF. The primary outcome was the absolute change in MRI-PDFF. The secondary outcome was a ≥30% decline in MRI-PDFF. A surface under-the-curve cumulative ranking probabilities (SUCRA) analysis was performed. Of 1550 records, a total of 39 randomized controlled trials (3311 participants) met the inclusion criteria. For MRI-PDFF decline at 24 weeks, aldafermin (SUCRA: 83.65), pegozafermin (SUCRA: 83.46), and pioglitazone (SUCRA: 71.67) were ranked the most effective interventions. At 24 weeks, efinopegdutide (SUCRA: 67.02), semaglutide + firsocostat (SUCRA: 62.43), and pegbelfermin (SUCRA: 61.68) were ranked the most effective interventions for achieving a ≥30% decline in MRI-PDFF. This study provides an updated, relative rank-order efficacy of therapies for MASH in reducing hepatic fat.

41070915,Conformational changes in ketohexokinase are conserved across isozymes and species.,"Ketohexokinase (KHK) catalyses the initial step in fructose metabolism, converting the furanose form of D-fructose to fructose 1-phosphate in an ATP-dependent reaction. Given its central role in metabolic pathways, KHK has emerged as a target for pharmacological intervention in the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes and obesity. KHK exists as two isoforms, A and C, which arise from alternative splicing of exon 3, resulting in a differing 45-amino-acid sequence within the 298-amino-acid primary structure of the enzyme. KHK is a biological homodimer, with each subunit adopting an α/β-fold architecture that interlocks with a β-clasp domain. In the case of KHK-C at least two distinct conformations of the β-clasp domain have been identified, whereas this conformational flexibility had not been observed in KHK-A. Here, X-ray crystallographic structural investigations of unliganded murine KHK-A refined to 1.37 Å resolution revealed the adoption of two conformations similar to those adopted by the human ortholog, suggesting that this structural feature is conserved across species. The functional significance of these conformational changes in KHK-A is of particular interest as this isoform has been implicated in cancer metastasis through a `moonlighting' protein kinase activity. Understanding the mechanistic role of conformational shifts in KHK-A may provide insights into its broader physiological functions and therapeutic potential.",2025,Nov,"Acta crystallographica.

41093119,Bioactive compounds and multitarget action mechanism of Erzhi pills in alleviating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.,"Erzhi pills (EZP), as a traditional Chinese herbal prescription, have protective effects against various forms of liver injury. However, the therapeutic potential, bioactive ingredients and mechanism of action of EZP for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) have not been completely elucidated. This research aimed to evaluate the therapeutic effect of EZP and its bioactive compounds on MASH. Two typical animal models of MASH, mice fed a methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diet (representing non-obese MASH) and mice fed a high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFHC) (representing obese MASH), were used to investigate the effect of EZP on MASH in vivo. Transcriptomic and proteomic analysis were performed to elucidate the under lying mechanisms of EZP. The compositional analysis of EZP in MASH mice was conducted using UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS. Free fatty acid (FFA)-stimulated HepG2 cells and transforming growth factor β1 (TGF-β1)-activated LX-2 cells were applied to further explore the effects and mechanisms of bioactive compounds from EZP. Our results indicate that the EZP mitigates hepatic lipid buildup, insulin resistance, inflammation, apoptosis, and fibrosis in different diet-induced MASH mice. Through multiomic analyses, UPLC-Q-Exactive-Orbitrap-MS analysis and molecular docking, we have identified that EZP exerts therapeutic effects on MASH involves activation of PPARα and PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 pathways, and inhibition of NLRP3, p53, and yes-associated protein (YAP) signaling pathways. It had been established that wedelolactone (wed), specnuezhenide (Spe), salidroside (Sal), and echinocystic acid-3-o-glucoside (Ech) served as the primary bioactive compounds in EZP for its therapeutic effect against MASH. In vitro experiments have confirmed that Spe, Sal, and Ech mitigate lipid accumulation by activating PPARα. Additionally, Spe and Sal improve insulin resistance through the activation of the PI3K/AKT/FoxO1 signaling pathway. Furthermore, Wed, Sal, and Ech inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome and p53 signaling pathways, thereby reducing inflammatory markers and providing anti-apoptotic effects. Moreover, Wed and Ech inhibit the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) by blocking the YAP signaling pathway. Notably, Sal and Ech were the primary bioactive components of EZP, and their combined anti-MASH efficacy was comparable to that of EZP. This study is the comprehensive elucidation of the active ingredients and mechanism of action behind EZP in its anti-MASH properties. EZP, as well as the combination of Sal and Ech are potential treatment for MASH that targets multiple signaling pathways.",2025,Oct,Journal of ethnopharmacology,Kai Gao; Wei Zhang; Meina Zhao; Dong Xu; Xingru Tao; Wangting Li; Meiyou Liu; Chao Guo; Yunyang Lu; Jingwen Wang,2648,True,2025-10-01

41043198,Targeting metabolic syndrome with ALIAmides: A novel multi-mechanistic approach.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) represents a growing clinical challenge worldwide, significantly increasing cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes risk, and all-cause mortality. Defined by a constellation of risk factors, including central obesity, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and insulin resistance, MetS is frequently associated with hepatic involvement such as metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). A growing body of evidence also highlights intestinal barrier dysfunction called ""leaky-gut syndrome"" and gut microbiota dysbiosis as key contributors to the chronic low-grade inflammation that underlies MetS. Current therapies, including statins, GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and antihypertensives, target individual components of the syndrome but fail to address its multifactorial pathophysiology. Additionally, these therapies often demonstrate tolerability issues, limited long-term adherence and compliance, and potential side effects particularly in hepatic and metabolic contexts. ALIAmides such as palmitoylethanolamide (PEA) and oleoylethanolamide (OEA) are emerging as promising adjunctive agents for MetS. By activating PPARs, modulating immune responses, and restoring gut barrier integrity, these compounds provide a multi-targeted strategy that addresses the complex pathophysiology of MetS.

If conception occurs, maternal obesity is associated with increased risks for both maternal and neonatal complications, with potential long-term effects on the offspring's health. Current clinical guidelines emphasize the importance of preconception weight optimization in women with obesity to reduce maternal and fetal risks. Amid the rising use of incretin-based anti-obesity medications, particularly among young women, their potential role in preconception care is receiving growing clinical and research interest. With unplanned pregnancies remaining common, incidental exposure during early pregnancy is becoming more likely. In parallel, there is increasing interest in the potential of these agents to support preconception weight loss and enhance fertility outcomes in women with obesity. This narrative review examines the current human evidence on GLP-1 and dual GLP-1/GIP receptor agonists approved for obesity treatment, focusing on their potential role in preconception care and addressing key safety considerations and challenges related to their use during the preconception period, as well as inadvertent exposure in early pregnancy.",2025,Sep,Best practice & research.

39569874,A Pragmatic Management Approach for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatosis and Steatohepatitis.,"Obesity and associated insulin resistance induce a chronic metaboinflammatory state that lead to injury and dysfunction of multiple organs resulting in a cluster of noncommunicable diseases such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a histologically active form of MASLD and characterized by greater injury and inflammation and progresses to cirrhosis with greater certainty than steatosis alone. The progression to cirrhosis is characterized by increasing fibrosis. The goal of treatment of MASLD/MASH was to improve the metaboinflammatory state i.e., the root cause of the liver disease and to prevent fibrosis progression to cirrhosis whereas in those who already have cirrhosis need additional care to prevent portal hypertension-related outcomes. Fibrosis regression is thus a key objective of treatment. The recent approval of resmetirom for MASH with fibrosis and the use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for obesity and type 2 diabetes has increased awareness of these NCDs and resulted in the growing demand for liver assessment and care in obese individuals. Patients with MASLD also have multiple metabolic comorbidities which represent competing threats to life, and the care of the patient requires both assessment of the totality of the risk and a more holistic approach integrating the care of all of the threats to life. Here, we provide a pragmatic and easily implementable risk-based approach to the evaluation and management of MASLD.",2025,Jan,The American journal of gastroenterology,Neha Shah; Arun J Sanyal,1648,True,2025-01-01

41169480,Mechanisms underlying cognitive impairment and management strategies in type 2 diabetes.,"Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for cognitive impairment, ranging from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to dementia. The underlying mechanisms involve a complex interplay of hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, vascular dysfunction, and amyloid pathology. Effective management strategies remain an area of active investigation. This review explores the pathophysiological mechanisms linking T2D to cognitive dysfunction and evaluates current and emerging therapeutic strategies to preserve cognitive function in diabetic patients. Chronic hyperglycemia and insulin resistance impair neuronal function and synaptic plasticity, while microvascular complications contribute to cerebral hypoperfusion and white matter lesions. Additionally, metabolic disturbances exacerbate neurodegenerative processes, further compromising cognitive health. Effective management strategies for cognitive impairment in T2D include regular cognitive screening, stringent glycemic control, lifestyle modifications, comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, patient education and pharmacological interventions such as metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RAs), and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, which may offer neuroprotective benefits. In this review, we conclude that cognitive impairment in T2D results from complex, interrelated mechanisms requiring early intervention and personalized strategies. While current therapies focus on metabolic and vascular risk reduction, future research should prioritize biomarker discovery, mechanism-driven treatments, and long-term clinical trials to optimize outcomes. A proactive, integrated care model is essential to mitigate cognitive decline in this high-risk population.",2025,01,Frontiers in endocrinology,Xiaolin Chen; Yan Huang; Xiaoxing Xiong,1791,True,2025-01-01
40736997,Dysregulation of hepatic deiodinase type I in metabolically associated steatotic liver disease.,"Hepatic thyroid hormone action plays an important role in preventing the development and progression of metabolic liver diseases, as evidenced by the recent success of the receptor-specific agonist resmetirom. The liver enzyme deiodinase type I (DIO1) is important for controlling the local availability of thyroid hormone and is upregulated in metabolically associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is thought to be a compensatory mechanism to enhance local hormone action. However, it remains unclear whether this increase is maintained in later stages of MASLD and whether an induction of Dio1 can provide beneficial metabolic effects. Studying mouse models with different stages of MASLD, we show here that Dio1 mRNA expression and activity are rapidly induced within 1 week by high-caloric dietary intervention. In later stages, this increase was less pronounced. Surprisingly, altered Dio1 mRNA concentration became progressively less well associated with altered DIO1 enzyme activity, suggesting uncoupling of mRNA and protein biosynthesis. In order to enhance DIO1 activity in MASLD development, a transgenic strategy was applied by using an adeno-associated virus-based liver-specific gene therapy with either the Dio1 or Socs3 gene. In either model, DIO1 activity was increased, but neither thyroid hormone target genes nor metabolic parameters were positively affected in the time frame of the experiment. We conclude that hepatic DIO1 biosynthesis becomes progressively disturbed with disease progression in MASLD by a decoupling of its transcript and protein levels, highlighting the key importance of translational processes controlling DIO1 in hepatocytes, which are likely affected by local inflammatory mechanisms.",2025,Aug,Journal of molecular endocrinology,Nuria Lopez-Alcantara; Alison-Michelle Naujack; Yingfu Chen; Natalie Taege; Cathleen Geißler; Rebecca Oelkrug; Eva K Wirth; Lutz Schomburg; Anita Boelen; Henriette Kirchner; Jens Mittag,1741,True,2025-08-01
41140513,Efficacy and Safety of Tirzepatide in Refractory Hypoglycemia Associated with Esophagojejunostomy.,"We present the case of a 40-year-old woman with severe recurrent hypoglycemia, unresponsive to dietary glucose intake and occurring in the context of chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction, esophagojejunostomy, and long-term parenteral nutrition. Extensive endocrine and imaging evaluations excluded insulinoma, autoimmune hypoglycemia, and counterregulatory hormone deficiencies, suggesting impaired incretin function as the likely mechanism. Conventional treatments-including acarbose, glucocorticoids, somatostatin analogues, and a long-acting glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA)-failed to provide adequate glycemic control. Given the exclusion of the proximal duodenum from nutrient transit and its key role in glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) secretion, therapy with tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, was initiated. Tirzepatide led to near-complete remission of hypoglycemic episodes and substantial improvement in glycemic variability and quality of life. Due to recurrence of symptoms before the next scheduled dose, the interval was shortened from 7 to 5 days, maintaining therapeutic efficacy. This case highlights the potential of tirzepatide in treating refractory hypoglycemia related to altered incretin signaling, particularly in patients with complex gastrointestinal surgical histories and parenteral nutrition. While currently approved for type 2 diabetes and obesity, tirzepatide may offer a novel off-label approach in select hypoglycemic syndromes in which GIP deficiency plays a central role.",2025,Nov,JCEM case reports,Mariangela Caporusso; Ludovico Di Gioia; Mariangela Manicone; Lucrezia Matera; Francesco Giorgino; Sebastio Perrini,1561,True,2025-11-01

We present the case of a 36-year-old man with newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes who developed severe euDKA within days of starting combined therapy with semaglutide and dapagliflozin. Despite prior patient education and adherence to antidiabetic therapy, persistent vomiting and carbohydrate deficiency-likely related to GLP-1 RA side effects-led to decreased insulin administration and metabolic decompensation. This case was characterized by very early onset after initiation of therapy, absence of infection or other common triggers, and resistance to standard treatment with insulin, glucose, and fluid resuscitation. Intensive care with continuous veno-venous hemodiafiltration was required, resulting in full recovery. This case emphasizes the potential severity of euDKA induced by GLP-1 RA and SGLT-2i combination therapy and highlights the risk of treatment resistance. The decision to initiate SGLT2i and GLP-1RA concurrently should be individualized or possibly spread apart in time, weighing the potential therapeutic benefits against the risk of rare but severe complication such as euDKA.

40985188,Neuroendocrinology meets addiction: Emerging pharmacotherapies on the horizon.,"Alcohol and other substance use disorders (ASUDs) are prevalent and major contributors to global morbidity and mortality. Their impact extends beyond the individual, imposing significant burdens on families, communities, healthcare systems, and society at large. Treatments include psychosocial, behavioral, and pharmacological interventions. However, available pharmacological treatments remain limited, primarily targeting alcohol, tobacco, and opioid use disorders, with a lack of approved pharmacotherapies for other substance use disorders. This gap highlights a critical need to develop novel treatment options. Emerging evidence suggests that bidirectional brain-periphery communications play important roles in the pathophysiology and progression of ASUDs. Gut-brain hormones that are involved in the regulation of feeding and metabolism have been shown to influence reinforcing properties of food, alcohol, and other addictive substances. Additionally, stress-related pathways, especially the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, play a significant role in regulating behaviors that are related to ASUDs. Accordingly, feeding- and stress-related neuroendocrine pathways represent novel pharmacotherapeutic targets for ASUDs.

41136477,Metabolic and alcohol-related steatotic liver disease and gastrointestinal cancer risk in diabetes.,"We investigated the relationship between incidence of gastrointestinal tract cancers, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and alcohol-related steatotic liver disease in diabetic population. A nationwide cohort of 2,616,828 individuals with diabetes under Korean National Health Insurance Service from 2015 to 2016 was divided into four subgroups: no steatosis (group 1), MASLD alone (group 2), MASLD with heavy alcohol intake (group 3), and alcoholic liver disease (group 4). We used fatty liver index to assess the probability of hepatic steatosis using cutoff scores of 30 and 60. We analyzed incidences of esophageal, stomach, colorectal, biliary, and pancreatic cancers until 2022. Compared with group 1 (reference), group 2 showed increased hazard ratios for stomach, colorectal, and biliary cancers, with a decreased hazard ratio for esophageal cancer (adjusted hazard ratio [95% confidence interval]: 1.10 [1.06-1.13], 1.13 [1.10-1.16], 1.10 [1.05-1.16], 0.88 [0.79-0.97], respectively).

41113119,"Safety and efficacy of 24 weeks of pemvidutide in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: A randomized, controlled clinical trial.","This was a double-blind 12-week extension of a randomized, placebo-controlled, 12-week trial of pemvidutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1/glucagon dual receptor agonist, in individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Completers of a double-blind trial of pemvidutide in MASLD, who were previously randomized 1:1:1:1 to pemvidutide at 1.2 mg, 1.8 mg, or 2.4 mg, or placebo administered subcutaneously once weekly for 12 weeks, were offered an additional 12 weeks of treatment at their originally assigned dose for a total of 24 weeks of treatment. Participants were stratified by the presence or absence of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The primary efficacy endpoint was relative reduction (%) from baseline in liver fat content by magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction after 24 weeks of treatment. There were 64 participants in the extension trial. Baseline mean values for BMI and liver fat content were 36.7 kg/m In individuals with MASLD, 24 weeks of pemvidutide treatment resulted in significant reductions in liver fat content and body weight that further improved upon the effects observed at 12 weeks. Overweight and obesity are strongly associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), as the excess liver fat associated with obesity is a known driver of these conditions. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists elicit weight loss through centrally and peripherally mediated effects on appetite, whereas G-coupled glucagon receptor (GCGR) agonists act directly on the liver to stimulate fatty acid oxidation and inhibit lipogenesis, providing a more potent mechanism for reducing liver fat content than weight loss alone. We previously showed that once-weekly treatment with pemvidutide, a dual GLP-1R/GCGR agonist, significantly reduced liver fat content, hepatic inflammatory activity, and body weight over 12 weeks. The current trial demonstrates that continued treatment with pemvidutide further improves these clinical markers of MASH.

41047006,Semaglutide and the pathogenesis of progressive neurodegenerative disease: the central role of mitochondria.,"While mitochondria provide critical energy resources, mitochondrial dysfunction can lead to both metabolic and neurodegenerative disorders. Primary mitochondrial disorders (e.g., Leigh syndrome) are uniformly associated with profound neurodegeneration. Recent studies have also implicated mitochondrial dysfunction as a central feature of progressive neurodegenerative diseases, notably Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, and Huntington's Disease. In addition to its profound impact on metabolic disease, the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, has significant neuroprotective features and may limit the progression of one or more of these disorders. These observations might be explained at least in part by the impact of this drug on mitochondrial function and energy production. Collectively, these observations highlight disrupted energy homeostasis as a critical feature of neurodegenerative disease and suggest novel targets for the development of much-needed new neuropharmaceutical strategies.",2025,Oct,Frontiers in neuroendocrinology,George B Stefano; Pascal Büttiker; Simon Weissenberger; Jiri Raboch; Martin Anders,1059,True,2025-10-01
40148030,Pharmacological treatment for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and related disorders: Current and emerging therapeutic options.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease) is a chronic liver disease affecting over a billion individuals worldwide. MASLD can gradually develop into more severe liver pathologies, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), cirrhosis, and liver malignancy. Notably, although being a global health problem, there are very limited therapeutic options against MASLD and its related diseases. While a thyroid hormone receptor agonist (resmetirom) is recently approved for MASH treatment, other efforts to control these diseases remain unsatisfactory. Given the projected rise in MASLD and MASH incidence, it is urgent to develop novel and effective therapeutic strategies against these prevalent liver diseases. In this article, the pathogenic mechanisms of MASLD and MASH, including insulin resistance, dysregulated nuclear receptor signaling, and genetic risk factors (eg, patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing 3 and hydroxysteroid 17-β dehydrogenase-13), are introduced. Various therapeutic interventions against MASH are then explored, including approved medication (resmetirom), drugs that are currently in clinical trials (eg, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, fibroblast growth factor 21 analog, and PPAR agonist), and those failed in previous trials (eg, obeticholic acid and stearoyl-CoA desaturase 1 antagonist). Moreover, given that the role of gut microbes in MASLD is increasingly acknowledged, alterations in the gut microbiota and microbial mechanisms in MASLD development are elucidated. Therapeutic approaches that target the gut microbiota (eg, dietary intervention and probiotics) against MASLD and related diseases are further explored. With better understanding of the multifaceted pathogenic mechanisms, the development of innovative therapeutics that target the root causes of MASLD and MASH is greatly facilitated. The possibility of alleviating MASH and achieving better patient outcomes is within reach. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, and it can progress to more severe pathologies, including steatohepatitis, cirrhosis, and liver cancer. Better understanding of the pathogenic mechanisms of these diseases has facilitated the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Moreover, increasing evidence has illustrated the crucial role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of MASLD and related diseases. It may be clinically feasible to target gut microbes to alleviate MASLD in the future.",2025,Mar,Pharmacological reviews,Xiang Zhang; Harry Cheuk-Hay Lau; Jun Yu,2642,True,2025-03-01

This study analyzed patients in an ongoing, multicenter, prospective, pre-post, uncontrolled cohort registry that enrolls unique, consecutive patients with type 2 diabetes treated with weekly subcutaneous semaglutide. Steatosis/fibrosis were determined by HSI (<30 ruled out, >36 steatosis) and FIB-4 (<1.3 ruled out, >2.67 fibrosis), respectively. The sample included 213 patients (46.9% women) with a median age of 64 (19) years. The median baseline body mass index and weight were 36.1 (8.4) kg/m These results show that weekly subcutaneous semaglutide had a beneficial effect on liver steatosis that went beyond glucose control. Its effects were mainly related to weight loss, a decline in biomarkers, and improvements in insulin sensitivity.

41155434,"Hyaluronic Acid in Liver Fibrosis: Role in Inflammation, Tissue Remodeling, and Disease Progression.","Hyaluronic acid (HA) is a major glycosaminoglycan in the hepatic extracellular matrix and pericellular space, playing a critical role in maintaining liver architecture and regulating cell-matrix interactions. In chronic liver disease, regardless of etiology, dysregulated HA metabolism, particularly the generation and accumulation of low-molecular-weight HA (LMW-HA), has been implicated in fibrogenesis, immune dysregulation, and hepatocellular carcinogenesis via receptor-mediated pathways involving lymphocyte homing receptor (CD44), receptor for hyaluronan-mediated motility (RHAMM), and Toll-like receptors (TLRs). This review synthesizes current evidence on HA biosynthesis, turnover, and signaling, emphasizing its dual role as a structural scaffold and as an active modulator of immune responses and tumor progression in chronic liver disease. Given the rising global burden of metabolic liver disease, and in line with our recent findings that small HA fragments are elevated in obesity and promote low-grade, TLR-dependent activation of innate immune cells, we emphasize metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) as a highly prevalent and clinically relevant setting to examine HA-driven immunomodulation during progression to advanced fibrosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to consider therapeutic strategies targeting HA synthesis, turnover, or receptor signaling.",2025,Oct,International journal of molecular sciences,Carlos Rojano-Alfonso; Cristina López-Vicario; Berta Romero-Grimaldo; Bryan J Contreras; Joan Clària; Esther Titos,1410,True,2025-10-01
41057780,Use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in idiopathic intracranial hypertension : a systematic review.,"Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) is a debilitating neurologic condition marked by elevated intracranial pressure (ICP), typically affecting obese women of reproductive age. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), widely used for obesity and diabetes, have recently emerged as potential therapeutic agents for IIH. To systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of GLP-1 RAs in IIH, based on clinical studies reporting outcomes related to ICP, headache, vision, cognition, weight loss, and safety. A systematic search was conducted across MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science up to June 15, 2025, using PRISMA 2020 guidelines. Studies involving adult IIH patients treated with GLP-1 RAs and reporting relevant clinical outcomes were included. Data extraction and bias assessment were performed independently by multiple reviewers. Nine clinical studies (one RCT, eight observational studies) with IIH patients receiving GLP-1 RAs were included. GLP-1 RA use was consistently associated with improvements in headache frequency, weight reduction, and reduced need for acetazolamide or surgical interventions. In a small RCT, exenatide significantly lowered ICP within hours of administration. Several studies reported papilledema resolution and a lower risk of visual deterioration. Cognitive function either improved or remained stable. Adverse effects were mostly mild gastrointestinal symptoms; no serious safety concerns emerged. Interpretation is limited by the predominance of potentially overlapped retrospective data and minimal randomized evidence. GLP-1 RAs show promise as a disease-modifying therapy for IIH, with potential benefits beyond weight loss. The consistency of findings across multiple studies and data sources provides justification of a shift in research focus to conduct well-powered phase 3 randomized controlled trials to validate these preliminary findings and define optimal treatment strategies.

41150667,The combination of zalfermin and semaglutide has additive therapeutic effects in a diet-induced obese and biopsy-confirmed mouse model of MASH.,"Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) analogs have significant therapeutic potential in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) but limited body weight effects in patients with MASH. This study investigated the effect of combined treatment with the FGF21 analog zalfermin and the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist semaglutide on body weight and plasma and liver biochemistry and histology in a mouse model of MASH. Amylin liver nonalcoholic steatohepatitis diet-induced obese-MASH mice with biopsy-confirmed MASH and fibrosis were administered (subcutaneous [SC], daily [QD]) vehicle, zalfermin (0.05 or 0.2 mg/kg), semaglutide (3 or 120 µg/kg), or zalfermin 0.05 mg/kg + semaglutide 3 µg/kg for 8 weeks (n = 11-12 per group). Vehicle-dosed (SC, QD) chow-fed mice served as normal controls (n = 10). Pre- to post-liver biopsy histology was compared for within-subject evaluation of changes in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Activity Score (NAS), fibrosis stage, and quantitative histology. Additional endpoints included plasma/liver biochemistry and liver RNA sequencing. Combined low-dose zalfermin and semaglutide treatment resulted in super-additive body weight loss (-18%) vs. individual low-dose monotherapies (zalfermin, -6%; semaglutide, -4%) and was equally effective as high-dose zalfermin monotherapy (-16%) and semaglutide (-15%). Low-dose combination therapy promoted greater benefits on transaminases, total cholesterol and triglycerides, NAS, steatosis, and inflammation vs. individual low-dose monotherapies and high-dose semaglutide, and high-dose zalfermin was as effective as the low-dose combination therapy on most endpoints. Combination treatment reduced gene expression markers of fibrosis to a greater degree than monotherapies. In conclusion, combined low-dose zalfermin and semaglutide, as well as high-dose zalfermin, resulted in beneficial effects on body weight and biochemical and histological endpoints, supporting the clinical development of zalfermin as therapy for patients with MASH.",2025,01,PloS one,Jenny Norlin; Maria Dermit; Nikos Sidiropoulos; Elisabeth D Galsgaard; Henrik H Hansen; Michael Feigh; Sanne S Veidal; Markus Latta; Emma Henriksson; Birgitte Andersen,2042,True,2025-01-01

41010364,GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Mood Disorders: A Psychiatric Perspective.,"Mood disorders, including major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD), are among the leading causes of disability worldwide and are frequently associated with treatment resistance, functional impairment, and high comorbidity with metabolic dysfunction. Increasing evidence implicates insulin resistance (IR) as a key pathophysiological factor linking metabolic and psychiatric illness. IR is associated with chronic low-grade inflammation, hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis dysregulation, impaired neuroplasticity, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered reward processing mechanisms that may contribute to core depressive features such as anhedonia, cognitive slowing, and emotional dysregulation. These processes are further exacerbated by the metabolic side effects of many psychotropic medications, creating a self-perpetuating cycle that worsens both psychiatric and physical health outcomes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), initially developed for type 2 diabetes and obesity, have emerged as promising candidates to address this metabolic-psychiatric interface. Beyond improving glycemic control and promoting weight loss, GLP-1 RAs exert central actions relevant to mood disorders, including modulation of dopaminergic reward pathways, enhancement of hippocampal neurogenesis, attenuation of neuroinflammation, and regulation of appetite and energy balance. Preclinical studies demonstrate that GLP-1 RAs reduce microglial activation, promote hippocampal neurogenesis, and normalize stress-induced behavioral changes. Early clinical trials in patients with metabolic disorders suggest improvements in depressive symptoms, quality of life, and cognitive function, with some effects independent of weight loss or glycemic outcomes. Observational evidence also indicates reduced antidepressant use and psychological distress in diabetic and obese populations receiving GLP-1 RAs. While these findings are promising, large randomized controlled trials in primary psychiatric populations are lacking. Key challenges include clarifying dose-response relationships, disentangling central from peripheral effects, and addressing safety and adherence concerns in individuals with comorbid psychiatric conditions. Future research should focus on biomarker-informed stratification, comparative trials with standard treatments, and integration of GLP-1 RAs into multimodal care frameworks. Overall, GLP-1 RAs represent a biologically plausible and clinically relevant approach to bridging metabolic and psychiatric care, with the potential to improve outcomes in patients with mood disorders who carry a high metabolic burden.",2025,Sep,"Life (Basel, Switzerland)",Pietro Carmellini; Alessandro Cuomo; Maria Beatrice Rescalli; Andrea Fagiolini,2667,True,2025-09-01
40996853,GLP1R and OCT1 variants modulate semaglutide and metformin response in type 2 diabetes.,"Large consortia link variants in SLC22A1, SLC47A1, and GLP1R to antidiabetic response, yet few data confirm these effects in small real-world cohorts. We tested whether three common polymorphisms translate into measurable 3-month metabolic changes. Twenty-seven Bulgarian adults with type 2 diabetes [BMI ≥ 25 kg/m²; mean glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c): 8.3 ± 0.9%] received metformin XR 2000 mg (n = 17) or oral semaglutide 14 mg (n = 10). Sanger sequencing identified SLC22A1 rs628031, SLC47A1 rs2252281, and GLP1R rs6923761. Primary endpoints were 3-month changes (Δ) in weight and HbA1c; analysis of variance and ordinary least squares regression assessed genotype and treatment effects, as well as covariate-adjusted linear models of 3-month change (Δ). Semaglutide produced greater weight loss than metformin [-6.5 ± 3.6 vs. -1.6 ± 2.5 kg; 95% confidence interval (CI) -7.6 to -2.2; P = 0.001] and larger BMI reduction (-2.0 ± 1.2 vs. -0.3 ± 0.9 kg/m²; P = 0.001). At an exploratory 10% FDR, only OCT1 rs34130495 dosage was associated with high-density lipoprotein (HDL) change in metformin-treated participants (β = +0.340 mmol/L per minor allele; P = 0.0026; q = 0.063; N = 16). GLP1R rs6923761 showed nominal trends for weight and BMI change in semaglutide users that did not survive FDR (P ≈ 0.06-0.07; q ≈ 0.29; N = 10).

Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, originally developed for glycemic control in type 2 diabetes, have demonstrated cardiometabolic benefits. However, limited population-based evidence exists on their association with cardiovascular risk markers among U.S. adults with overweight or obesity. This study aimed to evaluate the associations between GLP-1 receptor agonist use and cardiovascular risk markers (systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein {HDL} cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c) in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults aged ≥18 years with overweight or obesity. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2011-2018 were analyzed using survey-weighted linear regression. Adults aged ≥18 years with overweight or obesity and complete biomarker data were included. Primary exposure was GLP-1 use; outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and hemoglobin A1c. Among 16,744 unweighted participants, GLP-1 users had significantly lower systolic blood pressure (β = -5.44, p<0.05) compared to non-users. No statistically significant differences were observed in lipid profiles or A1c after adjustment. Age, BMI, insurance status, and diabetes diagnosis were significant covariates.

40391591,LEADS - a comprehensive human liver-on-a-chip for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) drug testing.,"Metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), also known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), is a progressive form of steatotic liver disease (SLD). It is an emerging healthcare threat due its high prevalence, accelerated and non-linear progression, and final culmination as decompensated liver failure and/or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The pathogenesis of NASH is complex with strong ethnic influences and genetic predispositions, underscoring the need for preclinical models that utilize patient-derived cells to enhance our understanding of the disease. Current models face three major limitations: (i) reliance on primary cells with limited reproducibility, high cost, short culture duration and ethical considerations, (ii) failure to recapitulate all key features of NASH, and (iii) inadequate drug testing data and/or data did not correlate with clinical responses. Therefore, there is a pressing need for robust and relevant preclinical models that faithfully recapitulate human NASH, allow generation of patient-specific models and provide quantitative responses for mechanistic studies and drug testing. We have developed a functional liver tissue-on-a-chip by co-culturing human adult liver stem cell (haLSC)-derived hepatobiliary organoids, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived Kupffer cells (iKCs) and iPSC-derived hepatic stellate cells (iHSCs). We simulated the metabolic microenvironment of hyper nutrition and leaky gut by treating the cells with a concoction of free fatty acids (FFAs), fructose, gut-derived lipopolysaccharides (LPS) and a gut-derived metabolite, phenyl acetic acid (PAA). Through optimization of co-culture media and induction regimens, we were able to stably induce steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, inflammation, and activation of iHSC and fibrosis-all key hallmarks of NASH. Our LEADS (liver-on-a-chip for NASH drug testing) model also recapitulated the pathological types of steatosis and allowed for quantification of the key features",2025,Jul,Lab on a chip,Gowri Manohari Balachander; Inn Chuan Ng; Roopesh R Pai; Kartik Mitra; Farah Tasnim; Yee Siang Lim; Royston Kwok; Yoohyun Song; Lai Ping Yaw; Clarissa Bernice Quah; Junzhe Zhao; Wahyunia L Septiana; Vishnu Goutham Kota; Yao Teng; Kexiao Zheng; Yan Xu; Sei Hien Lim; Huck Hui Ng; Hanry Yu,2011,True,2025-07-01

The DNB controller is enhanced to (1) use traffic density estimates instead of queues to optimize signal timings; (2) to consider the eight-phase two-ring NEMA controller configuration within the game-theoretic approach; and (3) to consider dynamically adaptable control time steps. The enhanced DNB controller is benchmarked against (1) a fixed-time traffic signal control using the state-of-practice Webster's method and an emerging Laguna-Du-Rakha (LDR) method for computing the optimum cycle length; (2) a state-of-the-practice actuated traffic signal control; and (3) a state-of-the-art reinforcement learning (RL) traffic signal controller presented in the literature. The controller is tested on two isolated signalized intersections, demonstrating enhanced overall intersection performance compared to the baseline pretimed and actuated controllers at various demand levels, and offers better performance than a previously developed RL controller. Specifically, the DNB controller results in a decrease in the average vehicle delay and queue size by up to 54% and 63%, respectively, compared to Webster's state-of-the-practice pretimed control. Unlike the RL controller, the DNB controller requires no pre-training while adapting to fluctuating traffic conditions, thereby providing a flexible framework for reducing traffic congestion at signalized intersections.

40992909,Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis treatment: spotlight on the latest hepatoprotective drugs.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become a major public health concern. Recently, the development of liver-targeted pharmacologic therapies has gained momentum, culminating in the conditional approval of resmetirom which has generated renewed optimism for the management of MASLD. In addition, several other investigational agents have shown promising results in clinical trials. In this review, we summarize the data on recent pharmacologic developments in the treatment of MASLD, with a particular focus on agents targeting the more progressive form - at-risk metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). These therapies act through a variety of direct and indirect pathways within the liver. The approval of liver-targeted therapies for MASH marks the beginning of a new era in disease management, offering promising outcomes even for advanced stages such as cirrhosis. The rising prevalence of obesity and T2DM suggests that new treatment options that can treat multiple comorbidities - including GLP1 receptor agonists, dual, and multi-agonists - are likely to play a significant role in the management of MASH.

Non-invasive scores, such as the FibroScan-aspartate aminotransferase (FAST) score, are used to identify candidates for therapy, but their ability to assess disease progression or treatment effect is unknown. We aimed to assess the association between FAST score and histological endpoints. We conducted a post-hoc analysis using data from a prior randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b trial at 143 sites across 16 countries. Patients (aged 18-75 years) with biopsy-confirmed NASH, fibrosis stage 1-3, and a Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease Activity Score (NAS) ≥4 were enrolled between January 2017 and September 2018, and randomly assigned to receive once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg or placebo for 72 weeks. A subgroup analysis of patients with FAST score and histological data in the pooled semaglutide treatment and placebo arms at baseline and week 72 was performed. The original trial is registered at ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02970942. A total of 122 patients were included in this post-hoc analysis (93 received semaglutide and 29 received placebo). FAST score reduction was associated with achieving the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis in the pooled semaglutide group (area under the receiver operating curve 0.69; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.58, 0.81). Mean FAST score reduction from baseline to week 72 was greatest in patients who met the primary endpoint  The potential of the FAST score as a non-invasive monitoring tool to identify histological changes following treatment requires further evaluation and validation.

39286709,Mechanisms of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Beneficial Effects of Semaglutide: A Review.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease stands as the predominant cause of chronic liver disease, with its prevalence and morbidity expected to escalate significantly, leading to substantial healthcare costs and diminished health-related quality of life. It comprises a range of disease manifestations that commence with basic steatosis, involving the accumulation of lipids in hepatocytes, a distinctive histological feature. If left untreated, it often advances to non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, marked by inflammatory and/or fibrotic hepatic changes, leading to the eventual development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Because of the liver's vital role in body metabolism, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease is considered both a consequence and a contributor to the metabolic abnormalities observed in the metabolic syndrome. As of date, there are no authorized pharmacological agents for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. Semaglutide, with its glycemic and weight loss advantages, could potentially offer benefits for individuals with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. This review aims to investigate the impact of semaglutide on non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",2024,Aug,Cureus,Sultan Alfawaz; Abdulhadi Burzangi; Ahmed Esmat,1250,True,2024-08-01

To better understand the impact of an unbalanced hypercaloric diet on liver phenotype in impaired autophagy, the study compared C57BL/6J wild type (WT) and MAPK15-ERK8 knockout (KO) male mice with C57BL/6J background fed for 17 weeks with ""Western-type"" (WD) or standard diet (SD). Liver features were monitored in vivo by high-frequency ultrasound (HFUS) using a semi-quantitative and parametric assessment of pathological changes in the parenchyma complemented by computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) methods. Liver histology was considered the reference standard. WD induced liver steatosis in both genotypes, although KO mice showed more pronounced dietary effects than WT mice. Overall, HFUS reliably detected steatosis-related parenchymal changes over time in the two mouse genotypes examined, consistent with histology. Furthermore, this study demonstrated the feasibility of extracting quantitative features from conventional B-mode ultrasound images of the liver in murine models at early clinical stages of MASLD using a computationally efficient and vendor-independent CAD method. This approach may contribute to the non-invasive characterization of genetically engineered mouse models of MASLD according to the principles of replacement, reduction, and refinement (3Rs), with interesting translational implications.",2025,Oct,Journal of imaging,Sara Gargiulo; Matteo Gramanzini; Denise Bonente; Tiziana Tamborrino; Giovanni Inzalaco; Lisa Gherardini; Lorenzo Franci; Eugenio Bertelli; Virginia Barone; Mario Chiariello,1505,True,2025-10-01

We used national claims data from Optum Labs Data Warehouse, which includes de-identified administrative and pharmacy claims from commercially insured and Medicare Advantage (MA) enrollees throughout the U.S., to identify adults who newly filled GLP-1RA-based prescriptions between April 1, 2016, and March 31, 2024. We calculated quarterly rates of new GLP-1RA fills per 100 person-years and compared the characteristics of individuals with T2DM and/or obesity with and without comorbid AUD. From 2016 to 2024, 555,224 individuals with T2DM and/or obesity newly filled prescriptions for GLP-1RAs, of whom 6606 had comorbid AUD.

41092499,Liuwei Dihuang Formula ameliorates glycolipid metabolism in type 2 diabetic rats through an integrated analysis of gut microbiota and bile acids.,"Liuwei Dihuang Formula (LD), a classic prescription for kidney-yin deficiency in China, has shown promising therapeutic potential in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Given the critical roles of gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism in T2DM, the mechanisms of LD in regulating these pathways require further clarification. In this study, we investigated the effects of LD on gut microbiota and bile acid metabolism in T2DM rats. LD administration significantly lowered fasting blood glucose levels and improved lipid profiles, thereby ameliorating glycolipid metabolism. 16S rRNA sequencing revealed that LD restored gut microbiota homeostasis by reversing T2DM-associated alterations, including increased Lactobacillus and decreased Bifidobacterium, Allobaculum, Turicibacter, and Blautia. Plasma concentrations of ten bile acids were simultaneously quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, demonstrating that LD significantly altered bile acid metabolism. Moreover, LD treatment up-regulated Takeda G protein-coupled receptor 5 (TGR5) and down-regulated farnesoid X receptor (FXR) mRNA expression in the ileum, accompanied by enhanced secretion of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide tyrosine-tyrosine (PYY). Collectively, these findings suggest that LD ameliorates glycolipid metabolism in T2DM rats by regulating the gut microbiota-bile acid axis, thereby providing new mechanistic insights into its antidiabetic effects.",2025,Oct,Journal of pharmaceutical and biomedical analysis,Xin Wang; Fangfei Zhang; Jiahui Zhang; Youyou Du; Tiantian Zhang; Shiwen Liu; Xin Di,1459,True,2025-10-01
41110425,Comparative risk of rheumatoid arthritis between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors in type 2 diabetes.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) causes disability, chronic pain, and reduced quality of life. Preclinical studies suggest glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) may reduce inflammation and protect joint tissues. This study compared GLP-1 RAs with non-GLP-1 RAs on the risk of RA in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Using the TriNetX network (2016-2023), we identified 2,688,327 patients with T2DM. Propensity score matching yielded 89,938, 111,074, and 88,054 pairs of GLP-1 RA users versus dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), basal insulin, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), respectively. Analyses followed an as-treated approach. Relative hazards of RA were estimated with Kaplan-Meier methods. Subgroup analyses were performed, and a sensitivity analysis used the intention-to-treat approach. In matched cohorts, GLP-1 RAs showed no significant difference in 7-year RA risk versus DPP-4i (HR 1.06, 95 % CI 0.98-1.15) or basal insulin (HR 0.98, 95 % CI 0.89-1.08). By contrast, SGLT2i use was associated with lower RA risk compared with GLP-1 RAs (HR 0.88, 95 % CI 0.80-0.96). Kaplan-Meier curves confirmed a significantly lower cumulative incidence of RA in SGLT2i users (log-rank p = 0.007). In this multicenter cohort study of patients with T2DM, GLP-1 RAs did not significantly alter RA risk compared with DPP-4i or basal insulin.

41076043,Long-Term Glycemic Control and the Risk of Liver Stiffness Progression and Liver-Related Events in MASLD.,"The long-term impact of type 2 diabetes (T2D) status and long-term glycemic control on disease progression and clinical outcomes in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remains unclear. To assess the association of diabetes status and long-term glycemic control with liver stiffness progression or regression, and liver-related events (LRE) in MASLD. We analyzed patients with MASLD from the VCTE-Prognosis cohort who underwent serial vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) assessments and HbA1c measurements. Long-term glycemic control was evaluated using the time-weighted average (TWA) HbA1c, which reflects both the magnitude and duration of glycemia. Patients were categorized as non-T2D, well-controlled T2D (TWA HbA1c<7%), or poorly controlled T2D (TWA HbA1c≥7%). Liver stiffness progression, regression, and LRE were examined using Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox proportional hazards models. Of 7,543 patients with MASLD, 4,090 had T2D (2,045 well-controlled, 2,045 poorly controlled), and 3,453 did not have T2D. Over a median follow-up of 4.1 years, patients with T2D had a higher risk of liver stiffness progression (HR=1.501, 95%CI 1.148-1.962, P=0.003) and LRE (HR=2.030, 95%CI 1.241-3.320, P=0.005), but not liver stiffness regression, compared to non-T2D patients. Among patients with T2D, poor glycemic control was associated with a higher risk of liver stiffness progression compared with good glycemic control (HR=1.524, 95%CI 1.182-1.965, P=0.001). No differences were observed for liver stiffness regression (P=0.957) or LRE (P=0.625) with glycemic control. Findings were consistent across sensitivity analyses. T2D was independently associated with a higher risk of liver stiffness progression and LRE in MASLD.

A 21-year-old female with a history of polycystic ovary syndrome, anxiety, depression, and obesity presented with irregular menstrual cycles, acne, and excess body hair. Her weight at initial visit was 275 lbs, with physical examination showing moon facies, dorsocervical fat pad, supraclavicular fat pad, and abdominal striae. Medications included sertraline 100 mg daily and metformin 500 mg daily, which was increased; spironolactone was added, and Ozempic 0.25 mg subcutaneously weekly was started and titrated up to 1 mg subcutaneously weekly. The patient lost 42 lbs with Ozempic but plateaued. A dexamethasone suppression test showed a non-suppressed adrenocorticotropic hormone 10 (reference: 7.2-63.3) and morning cortisol 6.7 ng/dL (reference: <1.8 ng/dL). The 24-hour urinary free cortisol was high normal 42 μg per 24 hours (reference: 6-42 μg per 24 hours) with a negative magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography scan for pituitary or adrenal tumors. A diagnosis of hypercortisolism of unknown origin was made, with the decision to treat with levoketoconazole. The patient lost an additional 47 lbs, resulting in a total weight loss of 89 lbs while on levoketoconazole and semaglutide, and the cortisol levels normalized. Limited literature exists on the management of hypercortisolism without an identifiable source. Our case shows that combined use of levoketoconazole and semaglutide resulted in significant weight loss and improvement of biochemical and psychological parameters.

Semaglutide showed efficacy in improving steatohepatitis. We longitudinally observed a MASLD cohort of T2D subjects starting semaglutide, to detect an improvement of non-invasive surrogates of steatosis and fibro-inflammatory liver involvement, evaluating the role of mild alcohol consumption. In 62 overweight/obese T2D subjects with MASLD (36 non-drinker and 26 mild alcohol consumers), anthropometric, bio-humoral and transient elastography (TE) data were collected before (T0) and after an average time of 6.4 month (T1) from injective semaglutide prescription. Circulating levels of hormones (GIP, GLP-1, glucagon, insulin) and inflammatory markers (TNFα, MCP-1, IL-18, IL-10) were measured. Steatotic and necro-inflammatory liver involvement was evaluated with FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness (LS), respectively. Significant (p < 0.006) T0-T1 reductions of BMI, waist circumference, fasting glucose, and HbA1c were observed. AST (-10 ± 3 IU/L), ALT (-18 ± 5 IU/L), GGT (-33 ± 15 IU/L), CAP (-25 ± 8 dB/m) and LS (-0.8 ± 0.4 kPa) were reduced, too. GLP-1 increased (+ 95.9 pM, p < 0.0001) and IL-18 was reduced (-46.6 pg/ml, p = 0.0002). After adjustment for confounders, CAP improving was only related to GLP-1 increase (ß=-0.437, p = 0.0122). Mild alcohol intake did not influence these relations. Use of semaglutide in subjects with T2D and MASLD is associated with a significant decline of liver steatosis and necroinflammation proxies; mild alcohol assumption did not exert any influence.

With the increasing use of incretin-based anti-obesity medications (AOMs), they have gained particular clinical relevance. This review aims to explore current evidence on the prevalence, underlying mechanisms, and management strategies for GI AEs associated with obesity therapies, with a particular focus on nausea, diarrhea, constipation, gastroesophageal reflux and cholelithiasis. A search of PubMed and Scopus was conducted for articles published between 2006 and 2025. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials, observational studies, and narrative or systematic reviews reporting on GI AEs in the context of obesity treatments, especially those involving incretin-based AOMs. Clinical trial data on AOMs indicate that GI AEs are reported in 65-84% of patients treated with liraglutide, semaglutide or tirzepatide, with the most common being nausea and diarrhea. These symptoms are primarily attributed to altered gastric motility and hormone-mediated changes in appetite signaling. Preventive strategies such as slow dose titration, dietary counseling, and supportive medications are commonly recommended to support tolerability and treatment continuation. GI AEs remain a common and often underestimated barrier to effective obesity management. Early recognition and structured management are essential to long-term success.

To address this gap, we developed species distribution models for 51 species from three taxonomic groups (fish, macrophytes, and macroinvertebrates) and projected their responses to intermediate (SSP245) and extreme (SSP585) climate scenarios for 2050 and 2070 the Chilean Mediterranean Ecoregion, South America. We assessed changes in habitat suitability and species richness under restricted colonization and non-colonization assumptions, identifying zones of habitat loss, gain, and stability, and from these identified potential climate refuges. Our results indicated that, by 2070 under the most extreme scenario (SSP585), average habitat loss for freshwater biodiversity could reach up to 33 %. Freshwater fish was the most vulnerable group, experiencing a 40 % loss, while macrophytes and macroinvertebrates showed comparatively greater persistence, with 26 % and 33 % loss, respectively. Nine fish species, six macroinvertebrates, and two macrophytes are projected to lose more than 50 % of their suitable habitat by 2070. Conversely, some species, particularly fish and macrophytes, could gain new areas of potentially suitable habitats, though colonization of these areas remains uncertain. Biodiversity hotspots are projected to shift to higher elevations and latitudes, depending on species' dispersal capacities. We identified three priority climate refuges in central Chile: the Nahuelbuta Range, the Valdivia Coastal Range, and a smaller area near Llanquihue. Only 14 % of these refuges currently overlap with existing protected areas. Our findings highlight the crucial need to incorporate climate refuges into the national network of protected areas. These areas offer key opportunities to mitigate biodiversity loss and support climate change adaptation. Prioritizing their protection and restoration, along with efforts to improve habitat connectivity, will be essential to maintaining freshwater biodiversity in this region under future climate conditions.",2025,Oct,The Science of the total environment,Gustavo Bizama; Ivan Arismendi; David E Uribe-Rivera; J Andrés Olivos; Arif Jan; Claudio Valdovinos; Roberto Urrutia,2141,True,2025-10-01
41140759,Development of a Neural Network to Detect Hepatic Steatosis in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"Early identification of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is critical for risk stratification and timely intervention. Conventional noninvasive indices (fatty liver index, hepatic steatosis index, Zhejiang University index, and MASLD index) are limited by linear assumptions and moderate predictive accuracy. We aimed to develop and externally validate a neural network model for noninvasive detection of hepatic steatosis. We used a retrospective cohort of 17,465 Japanese health checkup participants (2010-2020). All clinical data were obtained at the Ehime General Health Care Association. The cohort was split into a development cohort (n = 8426) and an internal validation cohort (n = 9039). A feedforward neural network was trained using clinical and biochemical variables, including body mass index, abdominal circumference, and existing indices. External validation used the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey cohort (n = 9759), with hepatic steatosis defined by ultrasonography (Gallbladder and Upper Abdominal Ultrasound Hepatic Steatosis Profile Rating≥2). Model performance was assessed via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration, decision curve analysis, and subgroup analyses. The neural network achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.922 (95% confidence interval: 0.913-0.931) in internal validation and 0.924 (95% confidence interval: 0.917-0.931) in external validation, outperforming fatty liver index, hepatic steatosis index, Zhejiang University index, and MASLD indices (all  Our neural network model outperforms conventional indices in detecting moderate-to-severe hepatic steatosis and may facilitate early, scalable MASLD screening in primary care and low-resource settings.UMIN No. 11953.",2026,01,Gastro hep advances,Masashi Hirooka; Teruki Miyake; Ryo Yano; Yoshiko Nakamura; Yuki Okazaki; Toyoki Shimamoto; Yasunori Yamamoto; Takao Watanabe; Osamu Yoshida; Kana Hirooka; Yoshio Tokumoto; Masanori Abe; Takeru Iwata; Yoichi Hiasa,1827,True,2026-01-01

To inform AE practices in future rehabilitation trials, details are provided on novel AE surveillance and reporting practices used in the Manual Therapy and Strengthening for the Hip (MASH) trial. The study design was a secondary analysis of multisite, single-masked, randomized controlled trial comparing 2 exercise-inclusive interventions. The study was conducted at research-based physical therapist sites. Participants were older adults with moderate-intensity, chronic low back pain with hip pain and muscle weakness. Participants were randomly assigned to receive 16 sessions of hip-focused or spine-focused physical therapy over 8 weeks. Active AE monitoring was facilitated with standardized interviews during each treatment session and at 8-week, 3-, 4-, 5-, and 6-months. Common Terminology Criteria for AEs classification was used. AEs were adjudicated by a site investigator and reviewed at multisite meetings. AE classification, relatedness, expectedness, severity, timing, recurrence, duration, and intervention impact were evaluated between interventions. Among 184 participants, there were 243 AEs (n = 128 hip-focused group, n = 115 spine-focused group) in 112 participants; 38.3% were unexpected, with 47 occurring in the hip-focused and 46 in the spine-focused group. AE relatedness, expectedness, and severity were similar between groups. Of the 243 AEs, 157 were mild, 71 were moderate, and 15 were severe/life threatening. Most AEs (80.2%) occurred early and were classified as Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (MSKCT), with shorter MSKCT AE duration in the hip-focused group. Within each group, 15 MSKCT AEs resulted in study modification. This analysis describes a framework to improve upon active AE surveillance during rehabilitation trials to better inform risk-to-benefit analyses. Data can also be used to inform clinical decision-making related to risks from MASH trial interventions.",2025,Oct,Physical therapy,Jaclyn M Sions; Steven Z George; Jenifer M Pugliese; Charity G Patterson; Sara Piva; Corey B Simon; Gregory E Hicks,2107,True,2025-10-01
40999299,Ten Year Follow-Up After Explantation of the Duodenal-jejunal Bypass Liner.,"The duodenal-jejunal bypass liner (DJBL) is a treatment for weight loss and diabetes management. While its short-term benefits are known, long-term outcomes of this endoscopic procedure remain largely unknown. This study investigates the long-term effects of DJBL placement on weight, diabetes, and quality of life (QoL) over a period of approximately 10 years post-explantation. A cross-sectional follow-up study was conducted in 103 former DJBL patients who had DJBL implantation (also known as the Endobarrier) between 2011 and 2014. Participants completed a questionnaire assessing their health, weight, lifestyle, diabetes control, and QoL. Data were compared to original cohort results. After approximately 10 years, weight, BMI, and HbA1c levels remained significantly improved compared to the time of DJBL explantation (p < 0.05). Of the respondents, 33 (32%) had undergone metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) post-explantation, with significant reductions in weight and BMI observed in this group. MBS was associated with better diabetes control and higher QoL scores compared to non-MBS patients. No significant differences in diabetes-related complications were seen between the MBS and non-MBS groups. GLP-1 agonists use was associated with a higher BMI but did not significantly affect weight, diabetes control, or QoL outcomes. Although DJBL treatment has some sustained benefits regarding weight and diabetes management, these effects are limited without further weight-reducing interventions. MBS following DJBL explantation leads to more substantial weight loss and improved diabetes outcome, highlighting its complementary role after DJBL treatment.",2025,Sep,Obesity surgery,Fenna M M Beeren; Marcel J M Groenen; Eric J Hazebroek; Peter D Siersema,1666,True,2025-09-01
41079750,Potential mechanisms of natural metabolites and botanical drugs foumulae for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: targeting the gut microbiota to modulate the immune system.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most prevalent liver disorder worldwide and is also a significant risk factor for triggering non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), hepatic fibrosis, and liver cirrhosis. Disorders in the hepatic immune system constitute one of the key drivers of NAFLD progression; thus, targeting immune dysregulation may represent an effective strategy to delay or reverse NAFLD advancement. Meanwhile, gut microbiota (GM) and its metabolites directly influence liver immune responses throughthe ""Gut-Liver Axis."" Dysbiosis of the GM triggers damage to the intestinal mucosal barrier. Subsequently, substantial bacterial metabolites derived from GM can induce overactivation of the hepatic immune response, thereby driving NAFLD progression. Thus, targeted intervention in the GM-immune response axis represents an effective therapeutic approach against NAFLD advancement. Numerous current studies indicate that botanical drugs and their metabolites can counteract NAFLD progression by intervening in GM and its metabolites to regulate hepatic immune imbalance. This article reviews the roles of immune cells, GM, and their metabolites in NAFLD development, while exploring the targets and/or pathways through which botanical drugs and their metabolites modulate GM and hepatic immune responses. This aims to provide a foundation for utilizing botanical drugs as natural adjuvants to address immune dysregulation during NAFLD treatment.",2025,01,Frontiers in pharmacology,Yutian Zhang; Lang Liu; Ruihao Song; Ziyi Qu; Tianlin Wang; Lei Liang; Shunhua Wang; Shuzhi Zhang; Huizhen Li; Hong Wang,1479,True,2025-01-01

Using molecular docking analysis, we investigated the pharmacological properties of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist such as semaglutide and its binding affinity to GLP-1R protein. Based on the transcriptome data of NAFLD-related datasets, we analyzed the expression profile of GLP-1R across healthy liver and NAFLD samples. Our clinical trial landscape revealed significant geographic disparities in NAFLD trials, with the US and China leading globally with 488 and 384 trials respectively. Phase IV accounted for the largest proportion (34.10%) among all trials. Among all the NAFLD-related agents, GLP-1R agonists were the most frequently used. In addition, GLP-1R was significantly and widely downregulated in NAFLD, especially in advanced stages such as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis.

39181210,Thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist HSK31679 alleviates MASLD by modulating gut microbial sphingolipids.,"As the first approved medication for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the thyroid hormone receptor-β (THR-β) agonist MGL-3196 (resmetirom) has garnered much attention as a liver-directed, bioactive oral drug. However, studies on MGL-3196 have also identified remarkable heterogeneity of individual clinical efficacy and its interference with gut microbiota in host hepatoenteral circulation remains to be elucidated. We compared MASH attenuation by MGL-3196 and its derivative drug HSK31679 between germ-free (GF) and specific-pathogen free (SPF) mice to evaluate the role of gut microbiota. Then cross-omics analyses of microbial metagenome, metabolome and single-cell RNA-sequencing were applied to a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multiple ascending dose cohort receiving HSK31679 treatment (n = 32) or placebo (n = 8), to comprehensively investigate the altered gut microbiota metabolism and circulating immune signatures. HSK31679 outperformed MGL-3196 in ameliorating MASH diet-induced steatohepatitis of SPF mice but not GF mice. In the multiple ascending dose cohort of HSK31679, the relative abundance of B. thetaiotaomicron was significantly enriched, impairing glucosylceramide synthase (GCS)-catalyzed monoglucosylation of microbial Cer(d18:1/16:0) and Cer(d18:1/24:1). In contrast to the non-inferior effect of MGL-3196 and HSK31679 on MASH resolution in GF This study provided novel insights into the gut microbiota that are key to the efficacy of HSK31679 treatment, revealing microbial GCS as a potential predictive biomarker in MASH, as well as a new target for further microbiota-based treatment strategies for MASH. Remarkable heterogeneity in individual clinical efficacy of thyroid hormone receptor-β agonists and their interferences with the microbiome in host hepatoenteral circulation are poorly understood. In our current germ-free mouse models and a randomized, double-blind, multiple-dose cohort study, we identified microbial glucosylceramide synthase as a key mechanistic node in the resolution of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.

The identification of novel biomarkers and peptides is one approach to diagnosing and treating such disorders. Spexin is a relatively new peptide hormone that plays a pivotal role in energy metabolism. The prominent role of spexin in obesity, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, diabetes, and insulin resistance has been established. This mini-review summarizes recent findings on the physiological and potential therapeutic roles of spexin in metabolic disorders. A targeted literature review of scientific sources was conducted using PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. The search focused on published experimental and clinical studies on the metabolic effects of spexin in the liver, adipose tissue, skeletal muscle, and pancreas. This peptide regulates energy homeostasis by affecting the metabolism of specific tissues. Spexin reduces hepatic fat accumulation by modulating lipogenesis and β-oxidation. In adipose tissue, spexin modulates adipocyte differentiation by enhancing lipolysis and inhibiting lipogenesis. In skeletal muscle, it is effective in increasing glucose uptake by upregulating glucose transporter 4. Spexin also affects insulin secretion and regulates β-cell function in the pancreas. Although studies on the physiological and therapeutic effects of spexin are ongoing, current evidence highlights its involvement in metabolic regulation.

Four eligible RCTs, enrolling over 27,000 patients with follow-up periods ranging from 32 weeks to 5.4 years, were included. GLP-1 receptor agonists consistently demonstrated renal protective effects, primarily driven by reductions in new or worsening nephropathy and macroalbuminuria, with more modest and inconsistent effects on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) decline. In contrast, their impact on retinopathy remained inconclusive. A transient signal of worsening retinopathy has been reported in the context of rapid glycemic improvement; however, across large outcome trials, effects on retinopathy have been inconsistent and remain inconclusive. Overall, the evidence for retinopathy risk is limited by small event numbers, heterogeneity in assessments, and exploratory analyses. The certainty of renal benefit was strengthened by rigorous trial designs and low risk of bias, whereas retinopathy outcomes were generally secondary and less robust. These findings suggest that GLP-1 receptor agonists can be prioritized for patients at high renal risk, but careful monitoring of individuals with pre-existing retinopathy remains warranted.",2025,Sep,Cureus,Atia Arif; Sanu Lama; Bhavna Singla; Shivam Singla; Sunita Kumawat; Anusha Tharwani; Muhammad Usman; Hamna Khalid; Venkata Madusudana Rao Kanukollu; Osatohanmwen Ekomwereren; Shabir Khan,1390,True,2025-09-01

To address this critical challenge, we developed a quantitative cross-species model designed to predict human clinical outcomes from efficacy data in mouse models. We performed a model-based meta-analysis (MBMA) of 18 NAFLD drugs, integrating data from published clinical trials with corresponding preclinical mouse studies identified through a systematic search of the Embase and PubMed databases. Using the change in alanine aminotransferase (ΔALT) as the primary biomarker, we constructed an exponential model to define the relationship between ALT reduction in mice and the placebo-corrected response in humans (ΔΔALT). The model's predictive performance was then externally validated using an independent dataset from a study of Linggui Zhugan Tang (LGZGT). The analysis yielded a robust exponential model, which revealed that a reduction in mouse ΔALT of at least 53.3 U/L is required for a drug to show superiority over placebo in human trials. A more substantial decrease of 128.3 U/L in mice predicted a clinical efficacy exceeding that of Resmetirom, the first FDA-approved therapy for this condition. The model's predictive power was successfully confirmed through external validation with the LGZGT data. This study developed a cross-species efficacy model from NAFLD clinical and mouse data, revealing an exponential relationship between human and mouse ALT levels.

However, its efficacy in preventing high fat diet (HFD)-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its relationship with gut microbiota and hepatic inflammation remain unclear. The study aims to investigate whether QKL can prevent HFD-induced NAFLD, focusing on the mechanistic role of gut microbiota, microbial metabolites, and hepatic inflammation. QKL was subjected to extraction and chemical profiling to identify its active compounds. In vivo studies were conducted in HFD-fed mice to assess the effects of QKL on hepatic lipid accumulation, inflammation, gut microbiota composition, SCFAs production, intestinal permeability, body weight, and fat mass. Chemical analysis revealed that the major components of QKL are gallic acid, corilagin, and chebulagic acid. QKL administration (12.33 and 24.66 mL/kg) for 8 weeks significantly reduced hepatic steatosis, serum lipid profiles (TG, LDL-C), and body weight in high-fat diet-induced NAFLD mice, while improving glucose tolerance and intestinal barrier integrity. Gut microbiota analysis revealed QKL enriched beneficial taxa (e.g., Akkermansia, Bacteroides) and suppressed pathobionts (e.g., Lachnospiraceae NK4A136_group), effects replicated through faecal microbiota transplantation from QKL-treated donors. QKL upregulated intestinal gene GPR41/43 and hepatic protein GPR135 expression, enhanced SCFAs production (acetic, propionic, and butyric acids), and activated AMPK/ACC1 signaling to suppress lipogenesis and promote lipid oxidation. Untargeted metabolomics demonstrated QKL restored hepatic fatty acid metabolism by reducing palmitic acid and arachidonic acid accumulation.

Propensity score matching was performed to minimize baseline differences between cohorts. The primary outcome was development of age-related cataract at 5-, 7-, and 10-year intervals. Risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals and corresponding p-values were reported. Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were calculated to assess covariate balance. In the primary analysis of GLP-1RA vs OWLD usage, covariate balance was achieved across all matched variables with SMDs < 0.2. In this primary analysis, GLP-1RA use was associated with a decreased risk of age-related cataract at 5 (RR: 0.278; 95% CI: 0.246-0.314; P<.0001), 7 (RR: 0.269; 95% CI: 0.241-0.299; P<.0001), and 10 (RR: 0.198; 95% CI: 0.176-0.222; P<.0001) years compared to OWLD use. GLP-1RA use was also associated with decreased risk at 5 (RR: 0.605; 95% CI: 0.553-0.661; P<.0001), 7 (RR: 0.499; 95% CI: 0.458-0.542; P<.0001), and 10 (RR: 0.437; 95% CI: 0.403-0.475; P<.0001) years compared to no drug use. Conversely, OWLD use was associated with increased risk at 5 (RR: 2.142; 95% CI: 1.957-2.345; P<.0001), 7 (RR: 2.093; 95% CI: 1.931-2.268; P<.0001) and 10 (RR: 2.111; 95% CI: 1.961-2.273; P<.0001) years compared to no drug use.

We conducted a comparative-effectiveness cohort study comparing HCRU and costs following empagliflozin versus GLP-1RA treatment in adults with type 2 diabetes (≥18 years) using US Medicare and commercial claims (08/2014-09/2019). We estimated rate ratios (RR) for HCRU outcomes using zero-inflated negative binomial regression and cost differences per member per year (PMPY) using gamma regression after adjusting for 143 baseline covariates via propensity score matching. We identified 146,341 matched pairs across all databases. After matching, the rates of hospital days, hospitalizations, emergency department (ED) visits, and physician office visits were similar between treatments. Empagliflozin had lower rates of dispensed medication classes versus GLP-1RA across most databases (RRs ranged from 0.91 to 0.95, RDs from -1246 to -709 per 1000 PY, reflecting varying degrees of precision). Total costs of care were lower with empagliflozin versus GLP-1RA. PMPY ratios ranged from 0.93 to 0.97 and differences from -$1425 to -$847. Inpatient and outpatient costs were comparable between treatments. Empagliflozin had lower pharmacy costs than GLP-1RA, mainly driven by glucose-lowering medications (PMPY ratios ranging from 0.91 to 0.95; PMPY differences from -$799 to -$441). Among adults with diabetes, empagliflozin was associated with similar rates of inpatient days, hospitalizations, ED, and office visits, with lower dispensed medication rates compared with GLP-1RA. Empagliflozin initiators incurred lower total costs, driven by lower glucose-lowering medication costs.",2025,Oct,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Phyo Than Htoo; Helen Tesfaye; Sebastian Schneeweiss; Deborah J Wexler; Robert J Glynn; Elyse DiCesare; Ariel Freedman; Niklas Schmedt; Christina Shay; Julie M Paik; Elisabetta Patorno,1825,True,2025-10-01
41171838,Effect of imeglimin on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in individuals with type 2 diabetes.,"Preclinical studies, including animal and in vitro experiments, have suggested that imeglimin, a novel antidiabetic drug, may have beneficial effects on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, its effect on MASLD in individuals with type 2 diabetes remains unclear. This study aimed to evaluate whether imeglimin has beneficial effects in individuals with type 2 diabetes and hepatic enzyme abnormalities. This multicenter, retrospective, single-arm study included 49 individuals with type 2 diabetes who newly initiated imeglimin treatment and continued it for six months. Individuals with chronic liver diseases other than MASLD were excluded. Treatment efficacy for liver function was defined as an ALT reduction of ≥11 IU/L, corresponding to the upper interquartile range of ALT reduction. Logistic regression analysis was performed to identify predictors of this treatment efficacy. Body mass index (BMI) and hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels significantly decreased after six months of imeglimin treatment. Additionally, both alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels significantly decreased (ALT: 21.0 IU/L [13.0-39.0] vs. 17.0 [12.5-28.0], p = 0.002; AST: 21.0 IU/L [17.0-30.0] vs. 18.0 [16.0-26.0], p = 0.010, respectively). Logistic regression analysis showed that baseline ALT and AST levels were significant predictors of treatment efficacy for liver function, after adjusting for HbA1c and BMI levels (OR 1.06, 95% CI 1.02-1.12, p = 0.006; OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.06-1.23, p = 0.002, respectively). Furthermore, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for baseline ALT as a predictor demonstrated excellent discriminatory performance (Area under the curve: 0.905, p = 0.004). A cutoff value of 25 IU/L yielded 100% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity. This exploratory study suggests that imeglimin may have beneficial effects in individuals with type 2 diabetes and elevated ALT (≥25 IU/L), potentially associated with MASLD. Randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings.",2025,01,PloS one,Naruyoshi Gyoutoku; Yukihiro Inoguchi; Junjiro Rikitake; Mutsuyuki Demiya; Mizuki Gobaru; Ayako Nagayama; Shimpei Iwata; Nao Hasuzawa; Hitomi Nakayama; Kenji Ashida; Masatoshi Nomura,2073,True,2025-01-01
41101688,METTL1-mediated m7G methylation of FoxO1 regulates lipid metabolism in metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD) is characterized by the accumulation and degeneration of lipids in hepatocytes, presenting a complex pathogenesis that complicates drug development. In this study, we found that methyltransferase-like 1 (METTL1) is upregulated in the livers of both MASLD mice and clinical samples. Hepatocyte-specific depletion of METTL1 inhibits lipid synthesis and promotes lipid oxidation, alleviating metabolic disorders in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced MASLD mice. Conversely, overexpression of METTL1 enhances lipid synthesis while suppressing lipid oxidation. Mechanistically, METTL1 regulates the stability and protein expression levels of FoxO1 mRNA by methylating the Exon1 region of FoxO1, as demonstrated by m7G sequencing. Additionally, we found that overexpression of FoxO1 counteracts the protective effects of METTL1 deficiency on metabolic disorders in MASLD mice. Moreover, we identified a potent small-molecule inhibitor of METTL1, specifically Homatropine Methylbromide (HtMBm), which significantly ameliorated HFD-induced MASLD. Overall, our study suggests that METTL1 plays a crucial role in the progression of MASLD and highlights the therapeutic potential of targeting METTL1 to modulate fatty acid metabolism in this condition.",2025,Oct,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,Jiang Du; Yujie Li; Xinxing Zhu; Jingwen Gao; Yuxuan Zhang; Chiheng Wang; Di Han; Liang Qiao; Beilin Kou; Rui Guo; Hongen Zhang; Juntang Lin,1296,True,2025-10-01

The prevalence of obesity has increased four-fold over the four preceding decades, with concomitantly rising rates of hypertension not far behind. Importantly, the interplay between these conditions exacerbates cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, and optimal management strategies remain an evolving challenge. This review synthesizes recent advancements in understanding obesity-associated hypertension pathophysiology and explores emerging therapeutic options, highlighting their relevance in shaping future clinical practice. Emerging research into understanding obesity-associated hypertension has identified mechanisms, including dysregulated hormonal signaling, increased sympathetic activity, and enhanced inflammation as the key processes underlying obesity-associated hypertension development. With respect to management, new dietary interventions are poised to overtake traditional strategies as the ideal approach to achieving sustained weight loss for obesity-associated hypertension patients. Additionally, while conventional antihypertensive medications highlight the mainstay of standard pharmacotherapy, recent studies highlight the efficacy of diabetic agents and other novel therapies, which have the potential to further shape obesity-associated hypertension management guidelines. As an emphasis on precision medicine underscores contemporary research into obesity-associated hypertension management, targeted treatment strategies are emerging as promising alternatives for reducing CVD burden and improving patient outcomes.

A vigilyze signal linking semaglutide to NAION.,"Semaglutide, available widely as Ozempic, Wegovy, and Rybelsus, has significantly improved the management of type 2 diabetes and obesity due to its beneficial adverse drug reactions and safer use in diverse population. However, as its use grows widely, rare but serious side effects are coming to light. One such emerging concern is Non-Arteritic Anterior Ischemic Optic Neuropathy (NAION), a condition causing sudden, often irreversible vision loss. A retrospective, post-market observational study was conducted using data collected from VigiBase® until June 2025, using mapped terms under Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). Of 73,636 global Individual Case Safety Reports (ICSRs) related to Semaglutide reported adverse reactions globally, 91 were associated with the adverse reaction NAION. The cases were reported globally with increased number of cases reported by Denmark (N = 38, 41.80%), Australia (N = 9, 9.90%) and France (N = 7, 7.70%), primarily affected patients aged 45-74 years (N = 50, 54.90%).

To address this gap, we review the molecular actions of testosterone, estradiol, and progesterone on liver functions, as well as the role of sex-hormone binding globulin (SHBG) in MASLD histogenesis, highlighting disparities by sex as well as reproductive status. We also discuss how sex hormones influence fatty acid metabolism, gut dysbiosis, mitochondrial activity, gluco-lipidic homeostasis, lipotoxicity, inflammation, and MASLD-related liver tumorigenesis. Furthermore, we examine observational studies on associations between endogenous and exogenous sex hormones and SHBG with MASLD, with attention to hypogonadism in either sex or polycystic ovary syndrome. We summarize the role of sex hormones in modulating MASLD risk across life stages such as menopause, breastfeeding, and lactation. Lastly, we review the hepatic effects of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) on MASLD in both sexes, prospects, and safety of HRT and contraceptives among individuals with chronic liver disease.

41039748,DNA-mediated UCP1 overexpression in adipose tissue: A promising anti-obesity gene therapy.,"Obesity has emerged as a global health challenge. Although GLP-1 receptor agonists are showing considerable promise in weight loss, their clinical utility is partly limited by gastrointestinal adverse reactions and non-fat weight loss side effects. UCP1-mediated adipose thermogenesis is a critical process for body temperature maintenance and weight management. However, the lack of effective and specific adipose thermogenesis therapies has restricted its clinical application. We aimed to explore the potential of inducing adipose-specific UCP1 overexpression via modified plasmids as an innovative therapeutic approach for obesity. We replaced the cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter in the plasmids with two types of adipose-specific promoters: mouse adiponectin (mADP) promoter and human adiponectin (hADP) promoter, to selectively overexpress UCP1 in adipocytes. The expression level of UCP1, weight loss, metabolic homeostasis and adipose thermogenesis effects were evaluated by immunohistochemistry, western blot, weight measurements, thermography, and comprehensive lab animal monitoring system. The experiments demonstrated that the mADP promoter-modified plasmids failed to drive UCP1 overexpression. In contrast, the hADP promoter-modified Ucp1 overexpression (hADP-Ucp1 OE) plasmids achieved robust adipose-specific UCP1 protein expression both in vitro and in vivo. In vitro experiments revealed that delivery of the hADP promoter-modified UCP1 overexpression (hADP-UCP1 OE) plasmids reduced lipid droplet size and enhanced energy consumption in human adipocytes. In obese mice, administration of the hADP-Ucp1 OE plasmids resulted in significant weight loss and improved metabolic homeostasis. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of hADP-UCP1 OE plasmids in obesity management. The hADP promoter-modified plasmids selectively overexpress protein in adipose tissue. Overexpression of UCP1 driven by hADP promoter induces thermogenesis in mouse and human adipocytes in vitro. The hADP-Ucp1 OE treatment promotes thermogenesis and energy expenditure in mice.

40999309,Assessment of serum glucagon-like peptide-1 and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 levels in patients with migraine.,"Migraine is a prevalent neurovascular disorder affecting over one billion people globally, imposing significant daily life limitations. Migraine headaches are linked to the activation of trigeminal nerve endings. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone involved in insulin regulation and plays neuroprotective roles in the central nervous system (CNS). Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a protease enzyme that degrades GLP-1, rendering it inactive, and modulates metabolic and neurological pathways. This study investigates the association between serum GLP-1 and DPP-4 levels and migraine pathophysiology to propose a novel therapeutic approach for migraine. The study included 42 migraine patients and 42 healthy controls. After fasting for at least 8 h, blood samples were collected. Serum GLP-1 and DPP-4 levels were measured using ELISA, and statistical analyses were conducted with SPSS 24.0. Serum GLP-1 and DPP-4 levels were significantly lower in migraine patients compared to controls (p < 0.001). Patients with migraine with aura had significantly lower GLP-1 levels compared to those with migraine without aura (p = 0.016). A significant decrease in GLP-1 levels was observed in patients experiencing pain localized in the occipital lobe (p = 0.01). Serum GLP-1 and DPP-4 levels were lower in migraine patients. Given the role of GLP-1 in the central nervous system, reduced GLP-1 may contribute to migraine pain. Similarly, low DPP-4, which metabolizes GLP-1, may be linked to these findings and could trigger attacks by increasing blood CGRP levels.",2025,Sep,Acta neurologica Belgica,Melis Gultekin; Fatih Davran; Nehir Yuksel; Ozge Beyazcicek; Serif Demir,1569,True,2025-09-01

38712213,Comparison of Wild-Type and High-risk PNPLA3 variants in a Human Biomimetic Liver Microphysiology System for Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease Precision Therapy.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a worldwide health epidemic with a global occurrence of approximately 30%. The pathogenesis of MASLD is a complex, multisystem disorder driven by multiple factors including genetics, lifestyle, and the environment. Patient heterogeneity presents challenges for developing MASLD therapeutics, creation of patient cohorts for clinical trials and optimization of therapeutic strategies for specific patient cohorts. Implementing pre-clinical experimental models for drug development creates a significant challenge as simple in vitro systems and animal models do not fully recapitulate critical steps in the pathogenesis and the complexity of MASLD progression. To address this, we implemented a precision medicine strategy that couples the use of our liver acinus microphysiology system (LAMPS) constructed with patient-derived primary cells. We investigated the MASLD-associated genetic variant PNPLA3 rs738409 (I148M variant) in primary hepatocytes, as it is associated with MASLD progression. We constructed LAMPS with genotyped wild type and variant PNPLA3 hepatocytes together with key non-parenchymal cells and quantified the reproducibility of the model. We altered media components to mimic blood chemistries, including insulin, glucose, free fatty acids, and immune activating molecules to reflect normal fasting (NF), early metabolic syndrome (EMS) and late metabolic syndrome (LMS) conditions. Finally, we investigated the response to treatment with resmetirom, an approved drug for metabolic syndrome-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the progressive form of MASLD. This study using primary cells serves as a benchmark for studies using patient biomimetic twins constructed with patient iPSC-derived liver cells using a panel of reproducible metrics. We observed increased steatosis, immune activation, stellate cell activation and secretion of pro-fibrotic markers in the PNPLA3 GG variant compared to wild type CC LAMPS, consistent with the clinical characterization of this variant. We also observed greater resmetirom efficacy in PNPLA3 wild type CC LAMPS compared to the GG variant in multiple MASLD metrics including steatosis, stellate cell activation and the secretion of pro-fibrotic markers.

41171863,Patient experiences with liraglutide for obesity and binge eating disorder-A qualitative study.,"Obesity is a growing health concern and a known risk factor for binge eating disorder (BED). BED is characterized by episodes of overeating with a loss of control, often leading to psychological distress. In some cases, medication may be recommended to manage depressive symptoms and support weight loss. Liraglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog, works by targeting the brain's reward system to reduce psychological stress and enhance feelings of fullness. However, there is limited research on the use of liraglutide for patients with both obesity and BED. This qualitative study aimed to investigate how patients with these conditions experience treatment with liraglutide. A qualitative design with individual semi-structured, in-depth interviews was employed. Eight informants aged 25-60 years were interviewed, and data were analyzed using systematic text condensation. Two main themes, each with three associated subthemes, emerged. The first main theme was: The role of food on the expression of BED, with subthemes: Food as an emotion regulator, Persistent thoughts on eating and dieting, and Emotional and situational triggers for binge eating. The second main theme was Experiences with liraglutide in managing BED, with subthemes: Meeting emotional and physical needs, Reducing thoughts about food, and Decreasing triggers for eating. The experiences with medication (main theme 2) influenced the expression of BED (main theme 1) as informants reported that liraglutide impacted their BED symptoms. Findings suggest that patients with obesity and BED found liraglutide helpful in addressing emotional and physical needs, enhancing emotional well-being, social interactions, and overall quality of life. Further qualitative research is needed to explore the long-term impact of liraglutide on emotional and behavioral changes in this population.",2025,01,PloS one,Ingrid Sørdal Følling; Stine Larsen Reigstad; Åsne Ask Hyldmo; Anne-Sofie Helvik,1869,True,2025-01-01

Recent years have seen the development of several therapeutic tools with a significant impact on diabetes complications. The present study aimed to investigate the possible renoprotective effect of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), in a rat model of adenine-induced CKD, together with its potential interaction with the underlying pathological activation of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). Computational assessment showed significant interactions among GLP-1 and GLP-1RA with components of RAS and inflammatory cascades within the context of CKD. For validation, twenty-five male Wistar rats were divided as follows: normal, CKD, and CKD treated with ramipril, liraglutide, or both. The CKD group developed significant perturbations in serum renal function parameters in addition to renal structural deterioration. This was accompanied by pathological changes in renal molecular expression profiles indicative of inflammation and apoptosis. Oxidative stress parameters aligned with the inflammatory changes. Treatment with liraglutide or ramipril equivalently improved renal function and ameliorated changes in renal structural and molecular profiles overall, albeit with slight variations in different parameters. Nevertheless, the combination of both treatments consistently showed superior effects to either treatment alone, supporting the possibility that GLP-1RA might affect more than one target in the RAS cascade.

41127673,Non-Cirrhotic Steatotic Liver Disease is Associated With Impaired Muscle Function: A Cross-Sectional Study.,"Impaired muscle function is frequent in cirrhosis and potentially participates in liver disease progression. Data from non-cirrhotic patients with steatotic liver disease (SLD) are lacking. Our aims were to determine if muscle function was impaired in a non-cirrhotic cohort of patients with SLD and if the SLD subtype and severity were associated with impaired muscle function. Patients with SLD and controls were prospectively recruited. Liver disease was assessed by imaging, vibration-controlled transient elastography and non-invasive tests. Muscle function was assessed by the liver frailty index (LFI) and isokinetic dynamometer. Diet and physical activity habits were recorded using dedicated questionnaires to measure the energetic balance. One-hundred and fifty patients with non-cirrhotic SLD (75 patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [MASLD] and 75 patients with alcohol-related liver disease [ALD]) and 30 non-SLD controls were prospectively recruited. The LFI negatively correlated to lower limb muscle strength assessed by isokinetic dynamometer in all participant groups ( Patients with SLD already show impaired muscle function compared to controls independently of age, gender and energetic balance. Taken together, our data support a potential disruption of the liver-muscle axis already occurring in SLD prior to cirrhosis.

41083699,Association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy and respiratory illness in patients with type 2 diabetes: a retrospective observational cohort study.,"Studies have shown that glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) provide lung benefits beyond glycemic control, including reduced risks of lung malignancy, pulmonary infection and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease exacerbations. A retrospective cohort study with a new-user and active-comparator design was conducted using the TriNetX US Network. Adults (≥ 18 years) with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) (n = 3,389,059) from January 1, 2005, to December 31, 2020, were identified. Two cohorts of new GLP-1 RA (n = 201,153) and new dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor (DPP4i) (n = 323,114) users were created. Propensity score matching was used to create comparable cohorts. The primary outcome was lung cancer, while other pulmonary conditions were secondary outcomes over a 10-year follow-up. Through 1:1 propensity score matching, two balanced cohorts of GLP-1 RA and DPP4i (n = 158,224) users were created. GLP-1 RA users had a significantly lower risk of lung cancer than did DPP4i users (hazard ratios [HR] 0.86; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.80-0.94). Reduced risk of influenza and pneumonia (HR 0.94; 95% CI 0.92-0.96) and pulmonary fibrosis (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.87-0.98) were also noted in GLP-1 RA users.

41139846,Effects of GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Therapy on Eating Disorder Risk and Psychological Distress in Adults With Class 3 Obesity.,"Eating disorders (ED) and psychological distress are highly prevalent in individuals with Class 3 obesity (BMI ≥ 40 kg/m This retrospective observational cohort study included adults with Class 3 obesity enrolled in a publicly funded multidisciplinary weight management program in Sydney from January 2018 to June 2024. Participants completed the Eating Disorder Examination-Questionnaire Short (EDE-QS), Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K10), and Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale-21 (DASS-21) at baseline and 12-months. Among 666 participants, 59 (9%) were on GLP1-RA at baseline, with no significant differences in EDE-QS, K10, or DASS-21 scores compared to those not on GLP1-RA. Of 203 participants not on a GLP1-RA at baseline and having 12-month data, 31 (15.3%) initiated GLP1-RA treatment, with the majority on semaglutide 1 mg and a mean duration of use of 7.1 ± 3.7 months. Those initiated on GLP1-RA had a significant reduction in median weight, from 131.0 (118.7-149.6) kg at baseline to 120.0 (109.2-135.3) kg at 12 months, p < 0.001. There were no statistically significant changes in EDE-QS, K10, and DASS-21 scores from baseline to 12 months, and none stopped GLP1-RA due to ED symptoms or psychological distress.

This study sought to evaluate the synergistic effects of these nutrients on MAFLD. This study enrolled 14,489 participants from the NHANES database. MAFLD was defined by liver fat accumulation and metabolic syndrome components. Multivariable logistic regression, restricted cubic spline modeling, and internal validation were applied to assess the dose-response and joint effects of protein and vitamin E, with gender stratification to explore effect heterogeneity. A Mendelian randomization (MR) approach was utilized to probe the causality between α-tocopherol and protein intake with MAFLD.

40496439,Mitochondrial dysfunction characterises the multigenerational effects of maternal obesity on MASLD.,"Although maternal obesity is an independent risk factor for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), the pathogenesis remains unclear. We aimed to evaluate the effect and mechanisms of multigenerational maternal Western diet (WD) on MASLD progression, and test drug candidates. Female mice were fed WD from 8 weeks before breeding initiation with a normal chow (NC)-fed male, throughout pregnancy and lactation. Male offspring were weaned onto NC or WD and assessed at the age of 24 days, 10 weeks, and 16 weeks (n = 5-11 per group). Additionally, offspring from dams with hepatic insulin receptor knockout were evaluated (n = 9-12 per group). Serum fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) and mitochondrial open reading frame of 12S rRNA-c (MOTS-c) were measured in adolescents with MASLD with or without a history of maternal obesity. The therapeutic efficacy of FGF21, semaglutide and an amylin analogue was assessed from 8 to 16 weeks of age (n = 8-12 per group). Starting from weaning age, maternal WD feeding aggravated body weight gain, insulin resistance, steatosis, and inflammation. Fibrosis was only observed in offspring exposed to maternal WD. Mechanistically, the latter exhibited reduced OXPHOS activity. Isolated maternal hepatic insulin resistance partially recapitulated offspring inflammation and fibrosis. Notably, OXPHOS was also downregulated in a transcriptomic dataset of maternal WD feeding in non-human primates. Serum FGF21 and MOTS-c correlated with MASLD severity and maternal obesity in adolescents. Particularly FGF21 treatment ameliorated steatohepatitis and mitochondrial function. Maternal WD aggravates MASLD in male offspring starting from weaning age, with mitochondrial dysfunction contributing to disease severity. This was reversed by FGF21 agonism. The underlying mechanisms of maternal obesity contributing to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) severity in the offspring are not completely understood. Our study characterises the impact of multigenerational maternal Western diet on offspring MASLD development and identifies mitochondrial dysfunction as a contributor to disease severity. In this setting, pharmacological compounds targeting mitochondrial dysfunction appear to have the greatest therapeutic potential.",2025,Jun,JHEP reports : innovation in hepatology,Anneleen Heldens; Milton Antwi; Louis Onghena; Tim Meese; Yannick Gansemans; Joél Smet; Ellen Dupont; Xavier Verhelst; Sarah Raevens; Hans Van Vlierberghe; Arnaud Vanlander; Filip Van Nieuwerburgh; Lindsey Devisscher; Ruth De Bruyne; Anja Geerts; Sander Lefere,2313,True,2025-06-01

Relevant data will be used to discuss how resmetirom impacts clinical practice. A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE from database inception to May 12, 2024. Keywords included non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, and resmetirom. Study selection, data extraction and all English-language studies involving the use of resmetirom for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)/NASH were included. Resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor agonist, is administered at daily doses of either 80 mg or 100 mg. The drug was shown to provide NASH resolution as assessed by the NAFLD activity score, 80 mg-24.2%, 100 mg-25.9% compared to 14.2% with the placebo group ( Resmetirom expands the medication options available to treat patients with NASH which can be given alongside other medications to optimize metabolic factors such as glucagon-like peptide-1 and hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors. Resmetirom was well tolerated in studies.

40513177,Controversies in nomenclature: From nonalcoholic steatohepatitis to the full spectrum of hepatic steatosis.,"The proposal for a nomenclature changes stems from the inaccuracy of the original term, as well as on the absence of any allusion to metabolic disorders and the stigma generated by the use of the terms ""nonalcoholic"" and ""fatty"". The term thus proposed a change from basing its definition on the existence of a histological lesion typical of alcohol damage in the absence of significant alcohol consumption to being defined by the presence of hepatic steatosis demonstrated through biopsy or imaging methods associated with cardiometabolic risk factors, such as diabetes, obesity, arterial hypertension or dyslipidemia in the absence of pathological alcohol consumption. This change has made it possible to define hepatic steatosis as a disease attributed to metabolic disorder and alcohol. This proves the specific similarities and differences between metabolic hepatic steatosis and alcoholic hepatic steatosis, both in their pathogenesis and in the role of genetics and the intestine-liver axis, as well as in potential therapeutic options such as resmetirom or semaglutide. Likewise, this change has made it possible to classify other specific and rare causes of hepatic steatosis, such as hepatotoxicity, immunogenic diseases, hepatitis C or celiac disease.",2025,Aug,Medicina clinica,Manuel Romero-Gómez; Sebastián Ferretti; Juan Pablo Arab,1263,True,2025-08-01

41089296,Combined Use of Aspirin and Statins Is Associated With Increased Risk of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease: A Study From National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.,"Aspirin and statins are often taken together in clinical practice. The impact of combined use of aspirin and statin (CAS) therapy on individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) or advanced liver fibrosis (LF) remains uncertain. This study is aimed at exploring their associations in US adults. This cross-sectional study used data from the 2011 to 2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, and 5889 participants were included. MASLD is based on the 2023 international expert consensus definition. Advanced LF is defined based on three commonly-used noninvasive fibrosis scores. Furthermore, prescriptions of aspirin and statins were categorized into untreated, single, and CAS to assess their potential associations with MASLD or advanced LF. The CAS group consisted mostly of older (66 years), male (58.5%), non-Hispanic White (74.5%) individuals who were highly educated (58.0%), obese (45.7%), never smokers (43.8%), moderate drinkers (38.5%), and had hypertension (75.3%) and diabetes (39.9%). CAS was associated with a 49% higher risk of MASLD (OR: 1.49; 95% CI: 1.12-1.99) and a 40% higher risk of advanced LF (OR: 1.40; 95% CI: 1.02-1.92) after full adjustment. Notably, stratification and interaction analyses demonstrated that metabolic parameters such as overweight/obese, diabetes, and hypertriglyceridemia significantly influenced the association between CAS and MASLD or advanced LF. In summary, the study indicates a positive correlation between CAS and MASLD or advanced LF. Using CAS should be cautious to avoid the increased risk of the above diseases.",2025,01,Gastroenterology research and practice,Zheng-Wu Jiang; Ya-Si Wang; Wen-Liang Tan; Bin Feng; Ming-Chang Zhang; Han-Qi Liao; Jian Wan; Xun Chen; Zhi-Qin Xie,1621,True,2025-01-01

A primary driver of NAFLD is the impaired PI3K/Akt signaling pathway, which regulates lipid metabolism, glucose homeostasis, and mitochondrial function. The dysregulation of this pathway promotes lipid storage, mitochondrial damage, and hepatocyte apoptosis, critical features of NAFLD progression. Due to the lack of currently approved pharmacological treatments, the need for effective therapeutic options is being emphasized. DC09, a derivative of 3-(2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl)-1-(5-methylfuran-2-yl)prop-2-en-1-one with antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and metabolic regulatory properties, shows significant potential as a treatment for NAFLD. Additionally, molecular docking and network pharmacology revealed the ability of DC09 to stabilize key PI3K/Akt pathway proteins through strong hydrogen bonding interactions, enhancing pathway signaling. Moreover, in HepG2 cells, DC09 exhibited antiapoptotic effects by preserving mitochondrial membrane potential and reducing oxidative damage. However, zebrafish larvae studies demonstrated that DC09 significantly reduced hepatic lipid, macrophage accumulation, and triglyceride deposition. In adult zebrafish, DC09 improved systemic metabolic parameters by normalizing glucose, cholesterol, and triglyceride levels and restoring body weight. Additionally, DC09 exhibited an enhanced antioxidant enzyme, which mitigated oxidative stress and was accompanied by the downregulation of lipogenic genes, namely fasn, srebp1, and c/ebpa. Histological analysis confirmed reduced steatosis, inflammation, and cellular damage. Overall, this study emphasizes the ability of DC09 as a promising therapeutic drug against NAFLD, by targeting the PI3K/Akt pathway to alleviate hepatic and systemic manifestations of the disease.",2025,Oct,Journal of biochemical and molecular toxicology,Santhanam Sanjai Dharshan; B Haridevamuthu; Karthikeyan Ramamurthy; B Aswinanand; Dhivya Loganathan Sumathi; Ilavenil Soundharrajan; Mansour K Gatasheh; S Karthick Raja Namasivayam; Kathiravan Muthu Kumaradoss; Jesu Arockiaraj,2016,True,2025-10-01
41079925,Immunotherapy resistance in MASLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma: special immune microenvironment and gut microbiota.,"Obesity represents a major global public health challenge. Consequently, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become the primary driver of chronic liver disease globally and is currently the most rapidly accelerating factor contributing to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). However, current evidence indicates that immunotherapy, a cornerstone of HCC management, yields suboptimal results specifically in MASLD-related HCC (MASLD-HCC) cases. Various immune components constitute a special immune microenvironment in MASLD-HCC, including heterogeneous myeloid cells, lymphocytes and platelets. Furthermore, disruptions in the intestinal barrier, along with the ectopic presence of intestinal flora and metabolites, also influence the immune microenvironment in MASLD-HCC. Elucidating immune cells functions and their interplay with gut microbiota is critical to deciphering MASLD progression to carcinogenesis and immunotherapy resistance. This review synthesizes current insights into the immune microenvironment and gut microbiome in MASLD-HCC, identifies factors influencing the efficacy of immunotherapy, and summarizes potential therapeutic targets to provide detailed guidance for developing effective immunotherapy strategies for MASLD-HCC.",2025,01,International journal of biological sciences,Jie Jin; Kun Cheng; Mingrui Chen; Huifang Liang; Wanguang Zhang,1277,True,2025-01-01
41097200,Dumping Syndrome After Bariatric Surgery: Advanced Nutritional Perspectives and Integrated Pharmacological Management.,"Dumping Syndrome (DS) is a significant complication following bariatric surgery, particularly Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). This condition is characterised by gastrointestinal and vasomotor symptoms resulting from altered anatomy and hormonal dysregulation, notably accelerated gastric emptying and an exaggerated release of gut peptides. Based on the timing of symptom onset after food ingestion, DS is classified as early (EDS) or late (LDS). The critical roles of peptides such as GLP-1, GIP, insulin, and YY peptide are highlighted, along with the involvement of neuroendocrine pathways in symptom manifestation. Diagnosis relies on a combination of clinical evaluation and dynamic testing, with the oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) often considered a key reference standard for diagnosis. Initial management involves dietary modifications, emphasising the glycaemic index of foods and meal distribution. In cases where nutritional interventions are insufficient, pharmacotherapy with agents such as acarbose, somatostatin analogues (octreotide and pasireotide), GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide), calcium channel blockers (verapamil), and emerging therapies, including herbal medicine, may be considered. For refractory cases, surgical options like bypass reversal or partial pancreatectomy are reserved, although their efficacy can be variable. Despite advancements in understanding and treating DS, further large-scale, randomised controlled trials are essential to validate novel strategies and optimise long-term management.

Glycaemic control rates (both HbA1c and post-prandial glucose control) are worryingly low among patients with T2DM in China, and 'clinical inertia' is a major challenge, in particular a reluctance among clinicians to initiate injectable therapy when oral antidiabetic therapies (OADs) are no longer achieving target levels of glucose control. Within the Chinese guidelines, clinicians now have the option to use a fixed-ratio combination of basal insulin (Glargine) and GLP-1 receptor agonist (lixisenatide), iGlarLixi, as a convenient, safe, and effective treatment for patients with T2DM. This review summarises the key clinical trials with iGlarLixi in Chinese and Asia-Pacific people, for example, the LixiLan-O-AP and LixiLan-L-CN trials, and highlights the advantages of this treatment for lowering HbA1c and post-prandial glucose. iGlarLixi is preferable to premixed insulin and can be combined with OADs among typical people with T2DM and poor glycaemic control.

The spectrum of MASLD covers from simple hepatic steatosis to the progressive metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with or without fibrosis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The MASLD symptoms include dyslipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance and obesity, the liver manifestations of metabolic syndrome. Treatment option for MASH fibrosis is limited. Since the discovery of bile acids as the endogenous ligands of farnesoid X receptor (FXR) in early 1990, bile acid and FXR based-drug therapies have been developed and tested in clinical trials for cholestatic liver diseases and MASH fibrosis. However, many of these drugs have unwanted side-effects and moderate efficacy in improving fibrosis. The US Food and Drug Administration has not approved any of bile acid- and FXR-based drugs for MASH fibrosis. Drug therapies alternative to bile acid derivatives for MASH have been in clinical trials. Recently, resmetirom, a liver-specific- and thyroid hormone receptor beta-selective agonist has been approved for MASH fibrosis.

To describe the trial design and baseline characteristics of the 'Effect of Semaglutide in Subjects with Non-cirrhotic Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis' (ESSENCE) trial (NCT04822181). ESSENCE is a two-part, phase 3, randomised, multicentre trial evaluating the effect of subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in participants with biopsy-proven MASH and fibrosis stage 2 or 3. The primary objective of Part 1 is to demonstrate that semaglutide improves liver histology compared with placebo. The two primary endpoints are: resolution of steatohepatitis and no worsening of liver fibrosis, and improvement in liver fibrosis and no worsening of steatohepatitis. The Part 2 objective is based on clinical outcomes. The current work reports baseline characteristics of the first 800 randomised participants which includes demographics, laboratory parameters, liver histology, non-invasive tests and presence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) cardiometabolic criteria.

38869512,EASL-EASD-EASO Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): Executive Summary.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as steatotic liver disease (SLD) in the presence of one or more cardiometabolic risk factor(s) and the absence of harmful alcohol intake. The spectrum of MASLD includes steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, previously NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This joint EASL-EASD-EASO guideline provides an update on definitions, prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment for MASLD. Case-finding strategies for MASLD with liver fibrosis, using non-invasive tests, should be applied in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, abnormal liver enzymes and/or radiological signs of hepatic steatosis, particularly in the presence of type 2 diabetes or obesity with additional metabolic risk factor(s). A stepwise approach using blood-based scores (such as the fibrosis-4 index [FIB-4]) and, sequentially, imaging techniques (such as transient elastography) is suitable to rule-out/in advanced fibrosis, which is predictive of liver-related outcomes. In adults with MASLD, lifestyle modification-including weight loss, dietary changes, physical exercise and discouraging alcohol consumption-as well as optimal management of comorbidities-including use of incretin-based therapies (e.g. semaglutide, tirzepatide) for type 2 diabetes or obesity, if indicated-is advised. Bariatric surgery is also an option in individuals with MASLD and obesity. If locally approved and dependent on the label, adults with non-cirrhotic MASH and significant liver fibrosis (stage ≥2) should be considered for a MASH-targeted treatment with resmetirom, which demonstrated histological effectiveness on steatohepatitis and fibrosis with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. No MASH-targeted pharmacotherapy can currently be recommended for the cirrhotic stage.

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were searched for relevant studies. The primary outcome was the change in the serum alanine transaminase level. The secondary outcomes were changes in liver stiffness, liver function test parameters, metabolic parameters, and safety. Pooled mean differences and relative risks were calculated using random-effects models. Six hundred studies were screened and eight were included (n = 2413). Semaglutide treatment showed a reduction in serum alanine transaminase [mean difference: 14.07 U/L (95% CI: 19.39 to -8.75); p < 0.001] and aspartate transaminase [mean difference: 6.89 U/L (95% CI: 9.14 to -4.63); p < 0.001] levels. There was a significant improvement in liver fat content [mean difference: 4.97% (95% CI: 6.65 to -3.29); p < 0.001] and liver stiffness [mean difference: 0.96 kPa (95% CI: 1.87 to -0.04); p = 0.04]. There were significant improvements in the glycated hemoglobin level and the lipid profile. However, the risk of serious adverse events [relative risk: 1.54 (95% CI: 1.02 to 2.34); p = 0.04] was high following semaglutide treatment as compared to placebo; the most common ones were gastrointestinal (nausea and vomiting, dyspepsia, decreased appetite, constipation, and diarrhea) and gallbladder-related diseases. Treatment with 24 weeks of semaglutide could significantly improve liver enzymes, reduce liver stiffness, and improve metabolic parameters in patients with NAFLD/NASH.

38764645,Molecular Dynamic Simulation To Reveal the Mechanism Underlying MGL-3196 Resistance to Thyroxine Receptor Beta.,"Thyroxine receptor beta (TRβ) is a ligand-dependent nuclear receptor that participates in regulating multiple biological processes, particularly playing an important role in lipid metabolism regulation. TRβ is currently a popular therapeutic target for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), while no drugs have been approved to treat this disease. MGL-3196 (Resmetirom) is the first TRβ agonist that has succeeded in phase III clinical trials for the treatment of NASH; therefore, studying its molecular mechanism of action is of great significance. In this study, we employed molecular dynamic simulation to investigate the interaction mode between MGL-3196 and TRβ at the all-atom level. More importantly, by comparing the binding patterns of MGL-3196 in several prevalent TRβ mutants, it was identified that the mutations R243Q and H435R located, respectively, around and within the ligand-binding pocket of TRβ cause TRβ to be insensitive to MGL-3196. This indicates that patients with NASH carrying these two mutations may exhibit resistance to the medication of MGL-3196, thereby highlighting the potential impact of TRβ mutations on TRβ-targeted treatment of NASH and beyond.",2024,May,ACS omega,Yi Lu; Chun Chen; Deyi Zhuang; Liling Qian,1182,True,2024-05-01
41131888,Early prenatal undernutrition leads to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in a rat model of menopause.,"The prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has increased. MASLD notably increases after menopause in women owing to the drastic reduction in estrogen, which regulates lipid metabolism. While prenatal undernutrition leads to hepatic steatosis after birth, whether prenatal undernutrition affects the onset of postmenopausal MASLD remains unknown. Therefore, we examined the impact of early prenatal undernutrition on the predisposition to postmenopausal MASLD in a rat model of menopause. Pregnant female rats were assigned to the control (CNTL) group, while the undernourished (UN) group was fed 40% of the diet of the control group. Furthermore, both groups were assigned to the ovariectomized (CNTL-OVX/UN-OVX) and sham-operated (CNTL-Sham/UN-Sham) groups at 12 weeks of age. Two-way analysis of variance revealed significant main effects of ovariectomy and prenatal undernutrition on body weight and hepatic triglyceride content. Triglycerides accumulated in the liver at 12 and 24 weeks after ovariectomy, while hepatic steatosis was histologically observed at 24 weeks after ovariectomy in UN-OVX rats. Hepatic gene expression analyses showed an interaction effect between prenatal undernutrition × ovariectomy in",2025,Oct,Journal of developmental origins of health and disease,Tomoko Kimura; Kodai Hino; Minoru Kuroida; Jun Udagawa,1260,True,2025-10-01

41116845,Could serum uric acid levels be a biomarker for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease?,"In this study, we investigated the relationship between serum uric acid (SUA) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in patients detected through abdominal ultrasound. The second aim was to determine if there were any gender differences. High SUA levels may contribute to the mechanisms underlying various metabolic disorders, including MASLD. We conducted a retrospective study among patients older than 18 who had been admitted to a tertiary hospital's gastroenterology outpatient clinic for over two years. A total of 200 patients diagnosed with either Grade 1, 2, or 3 hepatosteatosis by ultrasound screening and 200 patients without hepatosteatosis were included in the study. Patients' demographic features, laboratory parameters, and detailed medical history were extracted from the hospital's medical records. The mean age of the 400 patients enrolled in the study was 47.92±0.78 years, and 70.25% were men. SUA (5.34 mg/dL ± 1.52 vs. 4.64 mg/dL ± 1.28, p=0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (26.55 U/L ± 23.82 vs. 19.57 U/L ± 20.81, p=0.002), aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (22.68 U/L ± 20.35 vs. 18.07 U/L ± 9.89, p=0.005), and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) (6.45% ± 1.69 vs. 5.76% ± 1.23, p=0.001) levels were higher in the MASLD group. In the MASLD group, HbA1c, AST, and ALT were significantly higher in the Grade 2-3 group than in the Grade 1 (p=0.038, p=0.038, p=0.001, respectively). Elevated SUA levels are strongly linked to MASLD, particularly in males. Ease of measurement and low cost suggest that SUA could serve as a non-invasive biomarker for MASLD detection in at-risk groups.",2025,01,Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,Ömer Keskin; Ayşe Özdemir; Yusuf Üstün; Cenk Aypak,1639,True,2025-01-01
41067994,Association of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease with microvascular complications in adults with prediabetes.,"This study aimed to investigate the associations of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) with diabetic microvascular complications (DMC) in adults with prediabetes. A total of 50,123 adults with prediabetes from the UK Biobank were included. Participants were categorized into MAFLD/non-MAFLD groups and MASLD/non-MASLD groups. The severity of MAFLD/MASLD was assessed by noninvasive fibrosis scores and metabolic dysfunctions. DMC included diabetic retinopathy, neuropathy, and nephropathy. Cox proportional hazard regression models were used to assess the associations. Over a median follow-up of 13.4 years, 4327 participants developed DMC, including 394 cases of diabetic retinopathy, 440 of neuropathy, and 3682 of nephropathy. After fully adjustment for confounders, both MAFLD and MASLD were significantly associated with an increased risk of overall DMC (HR1.35[95 % CI:1.24, 1.46]), p < 0.001 and HR1.37[95 % CI:1.26, 1.49], p < 0.001, respectively) and its subtypes compared to non-MAFLD/non-MASLD participants. Furthermore, the risk of overall DMC increased with the elevated liver fibrosis scores and metabolic dysfunction numbers. In addition, The association between MAFLD/MASLD and risk of DMC remained significant in sensitivity analyses. In the UK Biobank cohort, both MAFLD and MASLD were independently associated with an increased risk of DMC and its subtypes in individuals with prediabetes. These findings highlight the importance of proactively monitoring and preventing MAFLD/MASLD for adults with prediabetes.",2025,Aug,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",Jingtong Xie; Qian Zhu; Xiaoxin Liu; Yuan Qu; Yan Jiang; Jin Wei; Yupeng Xu; Kun Liu,1624,True,2025-08-01

We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the therapeutic effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) on MASLD/MASH. We searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that compared GLP-1RAs with placebo or active agents with respect to the efficacy in patients with MASLD/MASH. The effects of GLP-1RAs on liver fat content (LFC) by imaging, liver histology, serum liver enzymes, and noninvasive fibrosis indexes [Fibrosis-4, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease fibrosis score, cytokeratin 18, procollagen III, and liver stiffness) were evaluated. Mean differences and risk ratios with 95% confidence intervals were pooled using a random-effect model. Twenty-five RCTs involving 2600 patients who used GLP-1RAs including liraglutide, exenatide, dulaglutide, semaglutide, tirzepatide, efinopegdutide, survodutide, and retatrutide were included. Overall, GLP-1RAs treatment for a median of 24 weeks demonstrated a significant reduction in LFC by 5.21%, with retatrutide displaying the most obvious treatment effects. GLP-1RAs treatment induced significant histological improvements in steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, and lobular inflammation but nonsignificantly improved fibrosis, with the evidence for tirzepatide more robust than that for semaglutide and liraglutide. GLP-1RAs treatment significantly decreased serum alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and γ-glutamyl transferase compared with control. GLP-1RAs also significantly improved liver stiffness, with semaglutide displaying the most obvious treatment effect. No drug-related adverse effects involving the liver were observed. GLP-1RAs decreased liver fat deposition and improved histological steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, and lobular inflammation, without worsening of fibrosis in MASLD and MASH.",2025,Sep,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Yahao Wang; Yue Zhou; Zhihong Wang; Yunzhi Ni; Gerald J Prud'homme; Qinghua Wang,2069,True,2025-09-01
41122332,Classification of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Grades using Pre-Trained Convolutional Neural Networks and a Random Forest Classifier on B-Mode Ultrasound Images.,"Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) as a prevalent condition can significantly have health implications. Early detection and accurate grading of NAFLD are essential for effective management and treatment of the disease. The current study aimed to develop an advanced hybrid machine-learning model to classify NAFLD grades using ultrasound images. In this analytical study, ultrasound images were obtained from 55 highly obese individuals, who had undergone bariatric surgery and used histological results from liver biopsies as a reference for NAFLD grading. The features were extracted from the ultrasound images using popular pretrained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, including VGG19, MobileNet, Xception, Inception-V3, ResNet-101, DenseNet-121, and EfficientNet-B7. The fully connected layers were removed from the CNN models and also used the remaining structure as a feature extractor. The most relevant features were then selected using the minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance (mRMR) method. We then used four classification algorithms: Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) neural network, and Random Forest (RF) classifiers, to categorize the ultrasound images into four groups based on liver fat level (healthy liver, low fat liver, moderate fat liver, and high-fat liver). Among the different CNN models and classification methods, EfficientNet-B7 and RF achieved the highest accuracy. The average accuracies of the LDA, MLP, SVM, and RF classifiers for the feature extraction method with EfficientNet-B7 were 88.48%, 93.15%, 95.47%, and 96.83%, respectively. The proposed automatic model can classify NAFLD grades with a remarkable accuracy of 96.83%. The proposed automatic classification model using EfficientNet-B7 for feature extraction and a Random Forest classifier can improve NAFLD diagnosis, especially in regions, in which access to professional and experienced medical experts is limited.",2025,Oct,Journal of biomedical physics & engineering,Amir Reza Naderi Yaghouti; Ahmad Shalbaf,1985,True,2025-10-01
41014899,Structure-based design of novel THR-β agonists and mechanism of activation research by molecular dynamics simulations.,"Thyroid hormone receptor β (THR-β) plays a crucial role in regulating lipid metabolism, steatohepatitis, and liver fibrosis. The approval of Resmetirom has demonstrated the therapeutic potential of THR-β agonism in treating metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Therefore, investigating the mechanism of THR-β activation is essential for understanding its mode of action and further research. In this study, we report a newly designed THR-β agonist, D4, which exhibits superior in vitro activity, with a Ki value of 257.3 nM, providing a valuable tool for exploring receptor activation. To gain mechanistic insights, we conducted 500 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on three systems: THR-β bound to agonist D4, THR-β bound to a known antagonist 6, and apo THR-β (ligand-free). A detailed analysis of the structural stability and activation mechanism of these systems was performed. Our findings suggest a novel activation mechanism in which a dynamic salt bridge relay, mediated by Loop-H11-H12, stabilizes the active state of the receptor. In addition, key hydrophobic interaction formed by antagonist and carbon chain of Arg438 was found to be crucial for ligands to switch from agonist to antagonist.",2025,Dec,Bioorganic & medicinal chemistry,Yang Gao; Haoran Zhu; Li-Xin Gao; Gao-Ya Xu; Jing Lin; Lujie Sun; Wei Li; Jia Li; Wei Fu,1218,True,2025-12-01
40755009,Prospects of late-stage development agents in the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a spectrum of pathology involving fatty liver disease that may progress to fibrosis, cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. The prevalence of MASLD and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) continues to increase, mirroring the rise in global prevalence of related comorbidities such as obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Due to the alarming rise of these comorbidities, a greater proportion of the population is at risk for developing MASLD and MASH. As such, there has been a significant effort to develop effective therapies for MASLD and MASH. Recently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist, as the first treatment for patients with MASH. In India, the Drug Controller General of India approved saroglitazar, a dual peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) α/γ agonist, for the treatment of MASLD. Currently, we have various drug classes, including liver-specific therapies, in Phase 3 development with even more agents earlier in the pipeline.

41033788,Rewriting the will: Autonomy and pharmacological desire modification in semaglutide use.,"This article responds to Ryan's and Savulescu's claim that semaglutide enhances autonomy by reducing problematic desires. Drawing on Frankfurt's hierarchical model of autonomy, this article argues that pharmacological alignment between first-order and higher-order desires can only be autonomy-enhancing if individuals also endorse the process by which their desires are reshaped. Further, it contends that socially influenced motivations, including those shaped by fatphobic norms, need not undermine autonomy so long as agents critically reflect on and endorse them. By reframing autonomy as a process of reconciling conflicting desires rather than a matter of outcomes, this analysis clarifies the ethical permissibility of pharmacological desire modification interventions. The broader implication is that respect for autonomy requires recognition of authentic authorship in contexts where medical and cultural forces shape desire, an approach that extends beyond weight-loss drugs to parallel debates about plastic surgery, gender-affirming care and addiction treatment.",2025,Oct,Journal of medical ethics,Julia Frant,1076,True,2025-10-01
41066465,MicroRNA-411-5p alleviates hepatic insulin resistance via suppressing transcription factor Sp2 in MASLD mice.,"Insulin resistance is often characterized as the factor that contributes to the emergence of metabolic diseases. Hepatic microRNAs (miRNAs) played critical roles in the development of metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and insulin resistance. To investigate the effects of hepatic miR-411-5p in regulating insulin resistance, the present study utilized primary mouse hepatocytes and mice with MASLD. Suppression of miR-411-5p decreased hepatocyte glycogen production and phosphorylation of AKT, but miR-411-5p mimic improved insulin sensitivity. Mechanistically, 3'-UTR of transcription factor Sp2 was one of the binding sites of miR-411-5p. Treatment of miR-411-5p mimic suppressed the Sp2 mRNA and protein levels, enhancing the insulin signaling activity in the primary mouse hepatocytes. Hepatocyte-specific overexpression of Sp2 induced hepatic lipid accumulation and activation of related metabolic pathways. In contrast, inhibition of miR-411-5p reversely upregulated the expression of Sp2 and exaggerated insulin resistance in primary hepatocytes and the mouse model. Similarly, miR-411-5p mimic decreased obesity-induced hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance, insulin intolerance, and pyruvate intolerance. Furthermore, the parameters of MASLD, including lipid deposits, inflammation, and fibrosis, were improved after miR-411-5p replenishment, but co-administration with adeno-associated virus (AAV)-Sp2 abolished these benefits in the obese mouse model. Taken together, these findings demonstrated that Sp2-dependent miR-411-5p action regulates insulin resistance and MASLD, which provides a therapeutic approach toward resolving insulin resistance.",2025,Nov,Journal of molecular endocrinology,Chunli Song; Jinglin Shao; Qingquan Xiong; Yao Men; Hezhongrong Nie,1678,True,2025-11-01

Thus, we assessed whether these drugs are associated with a decreased risk of dementia among patients with type 2 diabetes. Using the Clinical Practice Research Datalink from the UK, we formed two new user cohorts of patients at least 50 years of age with type 2 diabetes starting incretin-based drugs or sulfonylureas between 2007 and 2021. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for dementia were estimated separately for GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4 inhibitors using Cox proportional hazards models with propensity score fine-stratification weighting and inverse probability of censoring weights. Among 275,144 initiators of DPP-4 inhibitors or sulfonylureas, followed for 750,846 person-years, DPP-4 inhibitors were associated with a reduced dementia risk compared with sulfonylureas (4.4 vs. 5.7 events per 1000 person-years; HR 0.77, 95% CI 0.71-0.85). HRs decreased with increasing cumulative duration of use and dose. Similar associations were observed across dementia subtypes and individual DPP-4 inhibitors molecules. Among 181,215 initiators of GLP-1 RAs or sulfonylureas, followed for 530,415 person-years, GLP-1 RAs were associated with a similar reduction in dementia risk compared with sulfonylureas, although with high uncertainty (2.3 vs. 3.1 events per 1000 person-years; HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.46-1.18). The magnitude of the association increased with cumulative duration of use and dose but with high uncertainty.

The authors have stated that one of the most novel and promising treatments for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the use of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists, especially when used in combination therapy. However, despite their notable efficacy, these drugs were not initially designed to target MASLD directly. In a groundbreaking development, the Food and Drug Administration has recently approved resmetirom, the first treatment specifically aimed at reducing liver fibrosis in metabolic-associated steatohepatitis. Resmetirom, an orally administered, liver-directed thyroid hormone beta-selective agonist, acts directly on intrahepatic pathways, enhancing its therapeutic potential and marking the beginning of a new era in the treatment of MASLD. Furthermore, the integration of lifestyle modifications into liver disease management is an essential component that should be considered and reinforced. By incorporating dietary changes and regular physical exercise into treatment, patients may achieve improved outcomes, reducing the need for pharmacological interventions and/or improving treatment efficacy.

41143647,Gut microbiota-mediated oncogenesis in hepatocellular carcinoma: a new avenue for therapeutic intervention.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a leading cause of cancer mortality, and pathogenic gut bacteria contribute to its pathogenesis. This review explains how gut microbiota dysbiosis drives hepatocarcinogenesis through inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and immune modulation. Pathogens like Fusobacterium nucleatum, Helicobacter pylori, Clostridium spp., Enterococcus faecalis, and Escherichia coli disrupt intestinal barrier integrity, alter bile acid metabolism, and induce DNA damage. These interactions activate oncogenic pathways and suppress apoptosis, thereby creating a tumor-permissive environment. Risk factors, including viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, alcohol consumption, and dietary imbalances, combined with microbial dysbiosis to increase HCC risk. Genetic susceptibility affects host-microbe interactions, with polymorphisms in TLR4, ATM, and PNPLA3 worsening inflammation and metabolic dysfunction. Early detection through ultrasound surveillance, biomarkers, and microbiome interventions is key to improving patient outcomes. Clinical trials investigating H. pylori eradication, F. nucleatum detection, and E. faecalis-mediated inflammation have demonstrated the translational potential of microbiota modulation. Molecular docking analyses revealed pathogen-host receptor interactions (E. coli-TLR4 and H. pylori-PD-L1) that drive immune evasion and barrier disruption. These insights support integrated approaches that combine genetic screening, microbiome profiling, and precision therapies.

We start by reviewing the epidemiology of the condition and its close association with obesity and type 2 diabetes. We then discuss how randomized-controlled trials are performed following guidance from regulatory agencies, including differences and similarities between requirements of the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicine Agency. Difficulties and hurdles related to limitations of liver biopsy, a large number of screening failures in recruiting patients, as well as unpredictable response rates in the placebo group are evaluated. Finally, we recapitulate the strategies employed for potential drug treatments of this orphan condition. The first is to repurpose drugs that originally targeted T2DM and/or obesity, such as pioglitazone, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (liraglutide and semaglutide), multi-agonists (tirzepatide and retatrutide), and sodium-glucose transporter 2 inhibitors. The second is to develop drugs specifically targeting NAFLD/MASLD. Among those, we focused on resmetirom, fibroblast growth factor 21 analogs, and lanifibranor, as they are currently in Phase 3 of their clinical trial development. While many failures have characterized the field of pharmacological treatment of NAFLD/MASLD in the past, it is likely that approval of the first treatments is near. As occurs in many chronic conditions, combination therapy might lead to better outcomes. In the case of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, we speculate that drugs treating underlying metabolic co-morbidities might play a bigger role in the earlier stages of disease, while liver-targeting molecules will become vital in patients with more advanced disease in terms of inflammation and fibrosis.",2024,01,Gastroenterology report,Stefano Ciardullo; Emanuele Muraca; Michela Vergani; Pietro Invernizzi; Gianluca Perseghin,1921,True,2024-01-01
41070341,White adipose tissue browning and peroxisome proliferator activated receptors in MASLD.,"Metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has emerged as the predominant global etiology of chronic liver disease, with its incidence and prevalence continuously rising amid the obesity epidemic. The human body contains two primary types of adipose tissue: white adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT). The process of adipose tissue browning refers to the phenomenon wherein WAT acquires BAT like characteristics under specific conditions, leading to the generation of beige adipocyte clusters within WAT. This process is critically linked to metabolic diseases such as MASLD. Peroxisome proliferator activated receptors (PPARs) constitute a class of nuclear receptor proteins that function as transcription factors to regulate gene expression. PPARs play pivotal roles in adipose tissue biology, particularly in the process termed adipose tissue browning. These functions of PPARs have garnered significant attention due to their potential as therapeutic targets for MASLD and metabolic syndromes, including obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. PPARs may exert therapeutic effects on MASLD by promoting white adipose tissue browning; however, this mechanism lacks robust clinical evidence, and the safety profile of PPAR agonists requires further comprehensive evaluation.",2025,01,Frontiers in endocrinology,Zexuan Li; Huikuan Chu; Ling Yang,1310,True,2025-01-01
41101220,Exploring the nephroprotective effects of combined finerenone and exenatide therapy in diabetic nephropathy.,"Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is a progressive complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and a major cause of end-stage renal disease. Oxidative stress, inflammation, and dysregulated signaling pathways play critical roles in its pathogenesis. Finerenone, a non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist, and exenatide, a GLP-1 receptor agonist, are known for their renoprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant properties. This study aimed to evaluate the combined effects of these agents in a rat model of DN. Forty adult male Wistar rats were randomly divided into five groups: control, STZ-induced diabetic, STZ + finerenone, STZ + exenatide, and STZ + finerenone+exenatide. Diabetes was induced using streptozotocin (50 mg/kg). Treatments were administered for 21 days. Renal function was evaluated via serum urea, creatinine, and eGFR. Histological assessments included H&E, PAS, and Masson's trichrome staining. Inflammatory gene expression (TNF-α, IL-6, IL-1β, CCL2, CX3CL1, CX3CR1) was measured by qPCR. Protein expressions of p-STAT3, p-AKT, and p-NRF2 were analyzed by Western blotting. Oxidative stress markers (TAS, TOS, OSI) were also determined. The STZ group exhibited significant renal injury, increased inflammatory markers, and oxidative stress. Both finerenone and exenatide significantly improved histopathological and biochemical outcomes. This combination produced enhanced effects compared to monotherapies by reducing glomerular damage, inflammatory gene expression, and oxidative stress, while promoting NRF2 activation. The combined administration of finerenone and exenatide demonstrated potent nephroprotective effects in DN by attenuating inflammation and oxidative damage via modulation of NF-κB, PI3K/Akt/mTOR, and NRF2 pathways. These findings support the therapeutic potential of this combination for DN management.",2025,Oct,International immunopharmacology,Ayse Kocak; Elif Aydin; Meliha Koldemir Gündüz; Güllü Kaymak; Bünyamin Aydin; Ayşe Nur Değer,1863,True,2025-10-01
41123834,Pasteurized Akkermansia muciniphila AKK PROBIO Attenuates Obesity Through Gut Microbiota-SCFA-GLP-1 Axis and Potential Involvement of AMPK/PPAR-α Pathway.,"Obesity pathogenesis is closely linked to gut microbiota dysbiosis. Akkermansia muciniphila (A. muciniphila) has emerged as a promising next-generation probiotic candidate due to its metabolic benefits. In this study, we systematically evaluated the therapeutic efficacy of pasteurized A. muciniphila AKK PROBIO (P-AKK PROBIO) in high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obese C57BL/6J mice. The results revealed that P-AKK PROBIO administration significantly ameliorated hepatic steatosis and reduced body weight and body fat percentage by 15.24% and 28.82% over four weeks, respectively. The intervention also improved serum lipid profiles by reducing total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), while increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C). Furthermore, P-AKK PROBIO attenuated TNF-α-mediated inflammatory responses. Mechanistically, P-AKK PROBIO enhanced intestinal barrier integrity through upregulation of tight junction proteins (ZO-1 and Occludin) and restored gut microbial homeostasis, as indicated by a decreased Firmicutes/Bacteroidetes ratio. Notably, the treatment enriched beneficial bacterial taxa (Oscillospiraceae and Roseburia) and increased short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) production, particularly propionate, acetate, and butyrate. These microbial alterations correlated with elevated GLP-1 levels in both hypothalamic and ileal tissues, suggesting a dual mechanism involving GLP-1-dependent appetite regulation and lipid metabolism modulation. Furthermore, P-AKK PROBIO probably regulated key metabolic pathways by upregulating AMPK/PPAR-α signaling while downregulating PPAR-γ cascades. Collectively, these findings provide compelling evidence supporting the potential development of pasteurized A. muciniphila formulations for the management of metabolic disorders.",2025,Oct,Probiotics and antimicrobial proteins,Liu Yang; Yutian Huang; Mengling Chen; Xin Ma; Xueping Yu; Dayong Ren; Yue Leng,1843,True,2025-10-01

The mice received thioacetamide (TAA) (150 mg/kg, biweekly) via intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection for nine consecutive weeks to induce liver fibrosis. SEMA was administered orally once daily at a dose of 0.12 mg/kg. Administration of SEMA improved liver function as demonstrated by the reduction in the plasma levels of aminotransferases and gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT) along with the rise in serum albumin level. Moreover, SEMA mitigated the TAA-induced histopathological changes and reduced the content of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA). SEMA ameliorated the TAA-induced oxidative stress by mitigating the derangement in nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase, reducing glutathione (GSH) levels, and decreasing malondialdehyde (MDA) levels. The hepatic TGF-β/Smad signaling pathway was downregulated by SEMA treatment, while sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) content and phosphorylated AMP-activated protein kinase (p-AMPK) expression were upregulated. SEMA significantly reduced the severity of liver fibrosis induced by TAA through SIRT1 activation.

41146812,Mechanistic Insights Into the Cardioprotective Effects of Modern Glucose-Lowering Drugs in Type 2 Diabetes: A Systematic Review.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is closely linked to increased cardiovascular risk through mechanisms involving oxidative stress, adverse cardiac remodeling, and endothelial dysfunction. While glucose-lowering therapies improve glycemic control, their mechanistic cardiovascular effects remain incompletely understood. A systematic review was conducted according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, with comprehensive searches performed in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials through February 2025. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials and prospective mechanistic investigations enrolling adults with T2DM, with or without established cardiovascular disease or heart failure. Mechanistic endpoints encompassed echocardiographic indices, cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), vascular function, biomarkers of oxidative stress and inflammation, and metabolic parameters. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane RoB 2 tool. A total of 449 records were identified, of which 127 were excluded, leaving nine studies for inclusion. Trials evaluating sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors consistently demonstrated improvements in left ventricular remodeling, oxidative stress markers, and functional capacity, with some studies showing preserved mitochondrial respiration and favorable shifts in hemodynamic parameters. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) were associated with improvements in atrial strain, arterial stiffness, and diastolic function, albeit with modest effects on systolic performance. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors showed evidence of plaque stabilization without a significant impact on overall plaque burden. Metformin, in long-term follow-up, did not significantly reduce cardiac stress biomarkers. Overall, most studies were at low risk of bias, though post-hoc analyses and open-label designs introduced some methodological concerns. Glucose-lowering therapies exert heterogeneous mechanistic cardiovascular effects in T2DM, with the most consistent cardioprotective signatures observed for SGLT2 inhibitors and, to a lesser extent, GLP-1 receptor agonists. These findings highlight distinct biological pathways through which antidiabetic therapies may confer cardiovascular benefit, underscoring the need for further mechanistic trials with standardized endpoints to bridge the gap between glycemic management and cardiovascular outcomes.",2025,Sep,Cureus,Mounica Ratnala; Loveleen K Johal; Zulaihat F Galadima; Fatima F Janjua; Katherine S Trejos Guzman; Kirshan Lal; Maryam Fatima; Mashal Khan; Maryem Mallick; Sunil Yadav; Muhammad Usman Sarwar; Riaz Khan,2515,True,2025-09-01
41134524,Comparison of diagnostic criteria for fatty liver disease in assessing cardiac dysfunction: a cross-sectional study.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is an alternative to the established definition of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). We aimed to compare the utility of using MASLD and MAFLD in identifying individuals with impaired cardiac function. This cross-sectional study included 7,094 participants who underwent routine health examinations at Asan Medical Centre in Seoul, Republic of Korea. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed to diagnose fatty liver disease. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to assess cardiac function. MASLD and MAFLD were identified in 2,436 (34.3%) and 2,578 (36.3%) participants, respectively. Significantly lower E wave and E/A ratio with higher LA diameter, A wave, and E/E' ratio were observed in patients diagnosed with MASLD or MAFLD, indicating impaired diastolic function. The risk of left ventricular (LV) diastolic dysfunction is significantly higher in patients diagnosed with MAFLD only than in those diagnosed with MASLD only (24.2% vs 10.9%). Logistic regression analysis revealed, that compared with the presence of MASLD, the presence of MAFLD was independently associated with a 2.857-fold increase in the risk of LV diastolic dysfunction (95% confidence interval: 1.121-7.281, p = 0.028), even after adjusting for age, sex, and other clinical variables. The MAFLD and MASLD criteria are associated with LV diastolic dysfunction; however, the MAFLD criteria more accurately reflect early cardiac impairment in a generally healthy population. Therefore, adopting the MAFLD criteria in clinical practice may facilitate improved cardiovascular risk stratification and early intervention.",2025,Oct,Hepatology international,Yun Kyung Cho; Myung Jin Kim; Eun Hee Kim; Min Jung Lee; Hyo-Jung Nam; Woo Je Lee; Hong-Kyu Kim; Chang Hee Jung,1691,True,2025-10-01

In this study, dual GLP-1 and glucagon receptor agonist OXM-104 is compared head-to-head with the once-daily dual GLP-1 and glucagon receptor agonist cotadutide and GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide to explore the metabolic efficacy of OXM-104. The in vitro potencies of OXM-104, cotadutide and semaglutide were assessed using reporter assays. In addition, in vivo efficacy was investigated using mouse models of diet-induced obesity (DIO mice), diabetes (db/db mice) and diet-induced NASH mice (MS-NASH). OXM-104 was found to only activate the GLP-1 and glucagon with no cross-reactivity at the (GIP) receptor. Cotadutide was also found to activate the GLP-1 and glucagon receptors, whereas semaglutide only showed activity at the GLP-1 receptor. OXM-104, cotadutide, and semaglutide elicited marked reductions in body weight and improved glucose control. In contrast, hepatoprotective effects, i.e., reductions in steatosis and fibrosis, as well as liver fibrotic biomarkers, were more prominent with OXM-104 and cotadutide than those seen with semaglutide, demonstrated by an improved NAFLD activity score (NAS) by OXM-104 and cotadutide, underlining the importance of the glucagon receptor. These results show that dual GLP-1 and glucagon receptor agonism is superior to GLP-1 alone.

We applied the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services guidance to construct a list of therapeutic alternatives for each drug. Price benchmarks included the statutory discount, Big 4/Federal Supply Schedule prices, estimated Medicare Part D net prices, and wholesale acquisition cost. Comparative effectiveness evidence was extracted from peer-reviewed network meta-analyses, clinical guidelines, and Institute for Clinical and Economic Review assessments. Drugs were rated on a 4-tier scale (A-D) based on comparative net health benefit. Initial offers were then estimated by applying market-based discounts depending on the availability and type (branded vs generic) of therapeutic alternatives. For 6 drugs, statutory or Big 4/Federal Supply Schedule prices anchored the estimated initial offers. Four drugs were informed by clinically comparable branded alternatives, leading to approximately 20% reductions from net price. Two drugs with primarily generic alternatives received larger discounts of approximately 30%. Three drugs with therapeutic alternatives previously negotiated in Initial Price Applicability Year 2026 were assigned either the established maximum fair price or a market-based premium (semaglutide). Across all 15 drugs, estimated discounts ranged from 32% to 78% off list price and 16% to 56% off net price. Our analysis highlights how Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services may incorporate statutory discounts, prior maximum fair prices, and comparative effectiveness evidence into initial price offers, although uncertainty remains.

41015607,Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor analog use is associated with reduced thromboembolic events compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis patients: A global retrospective cohort study.,"Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an inflammatory disease associated with thromboembolic events. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogs, which are used in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), have shown potential anti-inflammatory effects, but their role in thrombotic events in RA is less clear. This study compares GLP-1 analogs to dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP4i) regarding thromboembolic events in RA. We performed a retrospective cohort study using TriNetX database to evaluate adult patients who carried the diagnosis of RA from January 1, 2006 to December 1, 2024 with co-existing T2DM and who initiated GLP-1 analogs or DPP4i after diagnosis of RA and T2DM. Patients were divided into two cohorts (GLP-1 vs. DPP4i), and the primary outcome was all thromboembolic events (cerebral infarction, myocardial infarction [MI], deep vein thrombosis [DVT], pulmonary embolism [PE]) within 5 years after GLP-1 analog or DPP4i start. Secondary outcomes included individual events, arterial and venous thrombosis, and all-cause mortality. Propensity score matching adjusted for demographic, clinical, and treatment variables. We analyzed 41,153 patients, including 25,425 GLP-1 analog and 15,728 DPP4i users, and compared 8,697 matched patients in each group. The median age at medication start was 65 years old, with 70% females. GLP-1 analog users had a 24% lower risk of all thrombotic events (hazard ratio [HR], 0.76 [95% CI: 0.70, 0.83]; p < 0.0001), as well as reduced risks of individual events and an overall lower mortality. Compared to DPP4i, GLP-1 analogs may lower the risk of thromboembolic events and reduce all-cause mortality in RA patients with T2DM. Key Points • The study identified significantly reduced risks in both arterial and venous thrombosis in RA patients receiving GLP-1 analogs compared with DPP4i. • RA patients who received GLP-1 analogs had lower all-cause mortality compared to those receiving DPP4i. • These findings support potential dual benefit of GLP-1 analogs in reducing inflammation and thrombosis in RA patients with diabetes.",2025,Nov,Clinical rheumatology,Qi Wang; Donald D Anthony,2067,True,2025-11-01

37729871,Combination of an ACLY inhibitor with a GLP-1R agonist exerts additive benefits on nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and hepatic fibrosis in mice.,"Increased liver de novo lipogenesis (DNL) is a hallmark of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). A key enzyme controlling DNL upregulated in NASH is ATP citrate lyase (ACLY). In mice, inhibition of ACLY reduces liver steatosis, ballooning, and fibrosis and inhibits activation of hepatic stellate cells. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists lower body mass, insulin resistance, and steatosis without improving fibrosis. Here, we find that combining an inhibitor of liver ACLY, bempedoic acid, and the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide reduces liver steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning, and hepatic fibrosis in a mouse model of NASH. Liver RNA analyses revealed additive downregulation of pathways that are predictive of NASH resolution, reductions in the expression of prognostically significant genes compared with clinical NASH samples, and a predicted gene signature profile that supports fibrosis resolution.

However, its effects vary depending on individual conditions, and to date insufficient research in human studies has been conducted to support its recommendation as a healthy eating approach. This study took the form of a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the effects of TRE on overweight and obesity in adults and on metabolic risk factors, specifically cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), considering fasting window, a common intervention, intake management, and intervention duration. A literature search was conducted on October 10, 2024, using the Ovid MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and CINAHL databases. The study followed the PRISMA checklist and included 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) with 1648 participants. The outcomes analyzed included weight, waist circumference, fat mass, plasma lipids, Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR), fasting glucose, and fasting insulin. The meta-analysis showed large effect sizes (ESs) for weight (ES: -1.40, 95% CI: -2.33 to -0.48) and waist circumference (ES: -0.75, 95% CI: -0.93 to -0.56), and a moderate ES for fat mass (ES: -0.61, 95% CI: -0.98 to -0.24). A small effect was found for HOMA-IR (ES: -0.29, 95% CI: -0.48 to -0.10). While there was heterogeneity for weight and fat mass, the sensitivity analyses were robust. In contrast, the effects on plasma lipids, fasting glucose, and fasting insulin were inconclusive. TRE may ameliorate metabolic risk factors in adults with overweight and obesity, offering a flexible approach adaptable to individual lifestyles. However, reductions in weight and fat mass may depend on the individual conditions, and the medications taken by individuals may influence the outcomes.

41110173,Berberine attenuates liver fibrosis via inhibition of Ang-2 through the toll-like receptor 4-mediated signaling pathway.,"Liver fibrosis, a key pathological feature in chronic liver injury, accelerates chronic liver disease (CLD) progression to cirrhosis. Fibrogenesis relies on angiogenesis balance, namely, physiological angiogenesis mitigates liver injury while pathological angiogenesis drives excessive collagen deposition and fibrotic progression. Therefore, targeting key regulators governing the transition from physiological to pathological angiogenesis is critical for treating liver fibrosis. In this study, two murine models of chronic liver injury were established: a carbon tetrachloride (CCl",2025,Oct,International immunopharmacology,Hong Wang; Yanan Zhou; Wenlu He; Fulan Zhao; Roman Spáčil; Wei Ren; Yining Ma,585,True,2025-10-01
40994081,Genetic evidence for repurposing GLP-1 receptor agonists in chronic kidney disease and IgA nephropathy: Metabolic and anti-inflammatory pathways beyond glycaemic control.,"Despite observational links between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and kidney benefits, causal mechanisms remain unclear. This study aims to dissect genetic causality and mediation pathways underlying the effects of GLP-1RAs on chronic kidney disease (CKD) and related renal outcomes. Using large-scale Genome - Wide Association Study (GWAS) data, we applied two-sample Mendelian randomisation (MR) to estimate the causal effects of GLP-1RAs on CKD, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and subtypes (IgA nephropathy, membranous nephropathy, nephrotic syndrome and chronic glomerulonephritis), with sensitivity analyses. The glycaemic markers (glycated haemoglobin [HbA1c] and blood glucose), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) served as positive controls. Mediation MR assessed body mass index (BMI), lipids, glycaemic markers and inflammatory proteins. Data were sourced from MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit Open Genome - Wide Association Studies OpenGWAS, FinnGen, GWAS Catalogue and cohort-specific studies. Positive control analyses revealed that genetically predicted GLP-1R activation was associated with reduced levels of HbA1c (p = 4.93E-15) and blood glucose (p = 9.73E-5), as well as a decreased risk of T2DM (p = 2.45E-4) and DN (p = 6.35E-4), fully validating the reliability of the genetic instruments. Genetic proxies for GLP-1R activation lowered risks of CKD (odds ratio [OR] = 0.83, p = 9.22E-9), immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) (OR = 0.70, p = 2.11E-3) and kidney function preservation (β = 0.01, p = 9.11E-3), but showed null effects on other CKD subtypes. Mediation analyses indicated that fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23) suppression mediated 26.57% of the effect on eGFR and 13.50% of CKD protection, whereas metabolic traits (BMI: 2.08% for CKD, 5.51% for eGFR; high-density lipoprotein: 0.79% for CKD, 2.34% for eGFR; HbA1c: 8.25% for eGFR) partially explained the benefits on CKD and eGFR. Only BMI exhibited a mediation effect on IgAN. Sensitivity analyses confirmed minimal pleiotropy. This study provides robust genetic evidence for repurposing GLP-1RAs in CKD and IgAN through anti-inflammatory (FGF23) and metabolic pathways, extending their utility beyond glucose control. While European ancestry data limit generalisability, our framework prioritises FGF23 and metabolic modulation as key targets for clinical trials in renal protection.",2025,Sep,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Xueying Yang; Wenhao Tang; Han Chan; Mo Wang; Haiping Yang; Qiu Li,2436,True,2025-09-01

This study aims to examine the associations of physical activity with the risk of liver cirrhosis, cancer, cardiovascular disease (CVD) incidence and mortality. 32 681 MASLD participants with accelerometer-derived physical activity data from the UK Biobank were analysed. Physical activity intensity was categorised into light (LPA), moderate (MPA) and vigorous (VPA) intensity. Cox proportional hazard and acceleration failure models were employed to assess associations between physical activity duration and outcomes. During a median follow-up of 7.5-7.9 years, 1883 deaths, 151 liver cirrhosis, 3312 cancers and 6657 CVD events were recorded. Physical activity, regardless of intensity, was consistently associated with a reduced risk of liver cirrhosis, CVD and all-cause mortality. Compared with non-MASLD individuals, our analysis indicates that longer duration of physical activity, specifically >1945 min/week of LPA or >383 min/week of MPA may theoretically eliminate the excess risk of mortality associated with MASLD. Among MASLD individuals, longer physical activity duration, regardless of intensity, was associated with reduced risks of liver cirrhosis and mortality. MPA and VPA were associated with lower CVD risk, while VPA was associated with reduced cancer risk, highlighting the potential benefits of increasing the intensity and duration of physical activity in MASLD management.",2025,01,BMJ open sport & exercise medicine,Sihua Xu; Yiyuan Xiao; Chaoyu Xu; Xiaoya Zeng; Liangyu Zhao; Tuojian Li; Deke Jiang; Rong Na; Haitao Chen,1617,True,2025-01-01
41069146,Controlled attenuation parameter is associated with metabolic disorders in patients with obesity in the Chinese population.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is associated with metabolic disorders. This study aimed to investigate the correlation between controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and metabolic disorders in patients with obesity. In total, 716 obese patients were enrolled. Participants were divided into two groups (non-severe and severe hepatic steatosis) based on their CAP value. The prevalence of metabolic disorders and anthropometric and biochemical parameters were compared between the two groups. Patients with severe hepatic steatosis exhibited significantly higher levels of blood pressure, fasting C peptide, glycated hemoglobin, homeostasis model assessment - insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), uric acid, and triglyceride, as well as lower levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) than exhibited by those without severe hepatic steatosis. CAP was signiﬁcantly positively associated with blood pressure, fasting C peptide, HOMA-IR, triglyceride, and HDL. After adjusting for age, sex, and body mass index (BMI), binary logistic regression analysis revealed that CAP could be a risk factor for hypertension, diabetes mellitus, decreased HDL, and elevated triglyceride. Furthermore, CAP may independently predict metabolic disorders, including hypertension, decreased HDL, and insulin resistance. Our findings suggest that CAP is closely associated with metabolic dysfunction in Chinese individuals with obesity, and it could serve as a good predictor of metabolic dysfunction, especially hypertension, decreased HDL, and insulin resistance.",2025,01,Endokrynologia Polska,Jiaqi Chen; Shihui Lei; Aijie Huang; Kelibinuer Mutailipu; Shen Qu; Haibing Chen; Le Bu,1568,True,2025-01-01

Unravelling the complex interplay between stimulation and expression.,"Mediated by the bitter taste receptors (TAS2R), the perception of bitter taste does not only involve the oral cavity but various physiological systems throughout the gastrointestinal tract. The relationship between stimulation and modulation is crucial for understanding the broader implications of bitter taste signalling in health and disease. In this study, we investigated how the expression of intestinal rat Tas2r (rTas2r) is affected by natural extracts containing bitter ligands, examined their association with obesity, and their effects on GLP-1 secretion. For this, we performed subchronic stimulations with a mixture of polyphenols and individual molecules in rats. Moreover, we also examined how the individual bitter molecule (epicatechin) affects the secretory profile of intestinal enteroendocrine cells. Treating rats with procyanidins up-regulated rTas2r in all the segments of the gastrointestinal tract, with the most changes observed in the duodenum and ascending colon. Epicatechin, one of the main components of the previously used extract, had a much more specific effect, as we observed mostly changes in the jejunum, where rTas2137, -139, -143 and -144 were up-regulated. In Hutu-80 cells, epicatechin downregulated TAS2R14 after 24 hours, which limited GLP-1 secretion after acute peptone stimulation. Our results support a network effect in the role of the bitter taste receptors along the intestinal areas that must be considered to address the work with bitter agonists.",2025,Sep,Journal of physiology and biochemistry,Florijan Jalsevac; Maria Descamps-Solà; Adrià Vilalta; Helena Segú; M Teresa Blay; Raúl Beltrán-Debón; Esther Rodríguez-Gallego; Ximena Terra; Anna Ardévol; Montserrat Pinent,1501,True,2025-09-01
41091718,Humanized monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 mice on a high-fat diet exhibit impaired liver detoxification during metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Obesity significantly increases the risk of hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes, and liver disease. This study examined humanized monoacylglycerol acyltransferase 2 mice (HuMgat2) and their response to a high fat diet (HFD) while investigating hepatocyte dysfunction during obesity development. HuMgat2 mice fed a HFD exhibited hyperlipidemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Elevated levels of cholesterol and triglycerides were associated with increased expression of lipogenic genes and accumulation of nuclear Srebp1/Srebp2. Mice fed a HFD demonstrated impaired insulin signaling and increased glucose production through the expression of gluconeogenesis genes. Liver fibrosis was characterized by collagen deposition and activation of Jak2-Stat3 signaling, resulting in hepatocyte apoptosis. RNA sequencing identified extracellular matrix degradation and apolipoprotein metabolism as being altered. Levels of cytochrome P450 enzymes were downregulated, as indicated by decreased Cyp2b10 and Cyb3a11 levels, alongside reduced expression of the di- and tri-carboxylic acid transporter Slc13a2, correlating with elevated Krebs cycle intermediates. Notably, HuMgat2 mice exhibited responses to a high-fat diet that were comparable to those observed in mMgat2 mice. These findings suggest that HFD consumption and concomitant obesity disrupts metabolite homeostasis, contributing to liver damage and cell death. They also further validate HuMgat2 mice as an excellent preclinical model for testing human MOGAT2 inhibitors as therapeutics for treating obesity.",2025,01,PloS one,J Jose Corbalan; Pranavi Jagadeesan; Joseph T Nickels,1629,True,2025-01-01

41125577,Neurocomputational basis of learning when choices simultaneously affect both oneself and others.,"Many prosocial and antisocial behaviors simultaneously impact both ourselves and others, requiring us to learn from their joint outcomes to guide future choices. However, the neurocomputational processes supporting such social learning remain unclear. Across three pre-registered studies, participants learned how choices affected both themselves and others. Computational modeling tested whether people simulate how other people value their choices or integrate self- and other-relevant information to guide choices. An integrated value framework, rather than simulation, characterizes multi-outcome social learning. People update the expected value of choices using different types of prediction errors related to the target (e.g., self, other) and valence (e.g., positive, negative). This asymmetric value update is represented in brain regions that include ventral striatum, subgenual and pregenual anterior cingulate, insula, and amygdala. These results demonstrate that distinct encoding of self- and other-relevant information guides future social behaviors across mutually beneficial, mutually costly, altruistic, and instrumentally harmful scenarios.",2025,Oct,Nature communications,Shawn A Rhoads; Lin Gan; Kathryn Berluti; Katherine O'Connell; Jo Cutler; Patricia L Lockwood; Abigail A Marsh,1160,True,2025-10-01
41061809,CYP4A14-PPARα axis serves as a therapeutic target for ursodeoxycholic acid in ameliorating high-fat diet-induced MASLD.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) represents a progressively critical global health concern, with no pharmacological interventions currently approved. Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA), an endogenous bile acid utilized in clinical practice, has demonstrated therapeutic potential in treating MASLD. However, the precise mechanisms by which UDCA exerts its hepatoprotective effects in MASLD remain to be fully characterized. We found that UDCA intervention markedly alleviated HFD-induced phenotypes, including hepatic steatosis, inflammation and metabolic disturbances, in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Mechanistically, UDCA treatment significantly activated hepatic peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) and Cytochrome P450 family 4 subfamily A member 14 (CYP4A14)-mediated β-fatty acid oxidation. In vitro, treatment with UDCA effectively reduced lipid accumulation and liver enzyme release in AML12 hepatocytes subjected to palmitic acid (PA) and oleic acid (OA) challenge. UDCA administration significantly activated the PPARα-CYP4A14 signaling pathway, however, siRNA-mediated knockdown of these components resulted in a significant reduction of UDCA's protective efficacy in alleviating lipid accumulation in PA/OA-induced cellular models. Additionally, molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations demonstrated stable interactions between UDCA and CYP4A14, indicating that UDCA may directly regulate CYP4A14 signaling. In conclusion, this study elucidates the CYP4A14-involved PPARα signaling as a novel mechanism by which UDCA exerts its anti-MASLD effects, thereby providing a theoretical foundation for considering UDCA as a potential therapeutic agent for MASLD.",2025,Oct,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,Bing Li; Pengjun Zhong; Xueling Zhang; Chengguo Li; Min Luan; Yanlin Chen; Lei Chen; Wu Li; Rihui Wu,1722,True,2025-10-01

We assessed work productivity burden in a real-world population with suspected/confirmed MASH, comparing work productivity and symptoms across subgroups (risk status, age, BMI, and comorbidities) in the USA using secondary data from Adelphi Real World MASH Disease Specific Programmes™, cross-sectional surveys of physicians and consulting patients in 2019 and 2022. Physicians (hepatologists, gastroenterologists, and endocrinologists) reported sociodemographic data and signs/symptoms for eight or fewer consecutive participants with MASH. Participants voluntarily completing questionnaires that assessed work productivity, health status, and quality of life/symptoms were categorized with low-, indeterminate-, or high-risk MASH using physician-stated fibrosis stage and derived risk categories. Principal components factor analysis identified factors from MASH signs and symptoms. Elastic net regression determined features associated with work productivity impairment. In total, 87 physicians and 429 individuals with MASH provided data. The impact of MASH on activities was greater in high-versus low-risk MASH (activity impairment score: high risk, 30.8%; low risk, 17%;  Activity impairment was greater in participants with high-risk MASH, whereas overall work impairment was comparable, almost 20%, in low- and high-risk MASH. Non-specific symptoms of fatigue, sleep disturbance, and general weakness associated with MASH and other conditions predicted work impact in low-risk MASH. Thus, early detection and management of MASH could ameliorate work impairment. Even in its early stages, when otherwise asymptomatic, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) may impact the ability to work. Using the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment: Specific Health Problem (WPAI:SHP) questionnaire, we identified activity and overall work impairment in people with high- and low-risk MASH. We found a link between difficulty working and other signs, such as tiredness, sleep disturbance, and general weakness, in low-risk MASH that are not specific to MASH but can be associated with liver health.

Additionally, much kombucha sold in the global marketplace is produced using instant mixes, pasteurization, filtration, and top carbonation, creating a shelf-stable ambient product at significantly lower cost than fresh, refrigerated traditional Kombucha. An 8-week randomized, double-blinded, parallel trial investigated the effects of daily kombucha (330 mL) consumption on urinary and plasma metabolomics in healthy adults aged 18-71. Participants of mixed gender and ethnicity consumed either a trial canned kombucha or a placebo (flavored water).

Urine samples were analyzed using Flow Infusion Electrospray Ionization Mass Spectrometry (FIE-MS), while plasma short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were quantified using Gas Chromatography-Flame Ionization Detection (GC-FID). The urinary metabolomic profile showed an increase in metabolites linked to kombucha-derived polyphenols and microbial fermentation, such as dihydroferulic acid and arabitol. Plasma analysis revealed a significant reduction in acetic acid and a marginal decrease in isoButyric acid after kombucha consumption.

41120259,Different gametogenesis states uniquely impact longevity in Caenorhabditis elegans.,"Reproduction affects lifespan and fat metabolism across species, suggesting a shared regulatory axis. In Caenorhabditis elegans, ablation of germline stem cells leads to extended lifespan and increased fat storage. While many studies focus on germline-less glp-1(e2144) mutants, the hermaphroditic germline of C. elegans provides an excellent opportunity to study how distinct germline anomalies affect lifespan and fat metabolism. We compare metabolomic, transcriptomic, and genetic pathway differences among three sterile mutants: germline-less glp-1, feminized fem-3, and masculinized mog-3. All three accumulate excess fat and share expression changes in stress response and metabolism genes. However, glp-1 mutants exhibit the most robust lifespan extension, fem-3 mutants live longer only at certain temperatures, and mog-3 mutants are markedly short-lived. The extended lifespan in fem-3 mutants require daf-16/FOXO, as in glp-1 mutants. In contrast, daf-16 is dispensable for the already shortened lifespan of mog-3 mutants. Interestingly, mog-3 partially mimics male/mating-induced demise, offering a simplified model to study metabolic and reproductive trade-offs underlying this phenomenon. Our data indicate that disrupting specific germ cell populations leads to distinct and complex physiological and longevity outcomes.

We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis with Medline, EMBASE and the Cochrane Register searched to December 2024. The primary outcome was the composite of kidney failure (defined as eGFR < 15 mL/min/1.73m2) or dialysis requirement, worsening of renal function and changes in proteinuria. Subgroup analysis was performed based on diabetic status, CKD and individual GLP1-RA drugs. Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI) for individual trials were pooled using random effects models. We identified 19 trials including 90 882 patients. Mean age was 60.8 years and mean follow-up was 25.9 months. GLP1-RAs were associated with a 19% reduction in the risk of primary renal outcome (RR 0.81, 95% CI 0.73-0.89), a 12% reduction in renal functional decline (RR 0.88, 95% CI 0.81-0.95) and a 0.45 ml/min/1.73m2 reduction in yearly loss (16 trials, MD 0.45, 95% CI 0.10-0.81).

However, its impact and safety in MASLD with compensated cirrhosis (MASLD-CC) remain relatively unexplored. Methods In a single-center, single-arm retrospective study, we assessed the impact of Saroglitazar (4 mg for 24 weeks) on liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) in MASLD-CC and evaluated safety and effects on biochemical indices and liver fat content (LFC) by MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF). To distinguish measurement error from true change, a threshold of 0.75 kPa for MRE-LSM was used to categorize LSM progressors and regressors. Results Twenty-six patients with MASLD-CC (age 61 (58-64) years; 61.5% female; BMI 28.7 ± 3.3 kg/m²; 88.4% obese; 76.9% with diabetes) completed 24 weeks of follow-up.

A decrease in MRE-LSM (5.4 (4.9-6.2) vs 5.1 (4.9-5.8) kPa) was seen in the overall cohort (p = 0.04). However, only 4 (15.3%) and 2 (7.6%) showed MRE-LSM regression and progression of ≥ 0.75 kPa, respectively. No differences were noted between regressors and progressors using the 0.75 kPa threshold (23.5% vs 22.2%, p = 0.91). Two patients (pruritus and increased urine frequency) reported adverse events.

41024632,Documentation of Compounded GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in a Large Primary Care Dataset.,"Large telehealth companies and smaller aesthetic medicine providers used compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide to meet consumer demand for these drugs during their shortages. In this study, we estimate the documentation rate of compounded formulations of these drugs in the US primary care and characterize differences between users of compounded and brand-name formulations of these drugs. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the American Family Cohort, a nationwide US database of electronic health records from primary care practices, spanning January 1, 2021, to December 31, 2024. Patients with documented semaglutide and/or tirzepatide use were included. Brand-name drug prescriptions were identified from structured data; compounded formulation use was identified from clinical notes. Outcomes included the proportion of patients using compounded formulations and their characteristics. Among 153 044 included patients (64.0% female, mean age 55.0 years), 8.2% used compounded formulations, which made up an increasing share of semaglutide and tirzepatide use over time. Users of compounded formulations had longer mean therapy durations (compounded only: 10.0 months vs. brand-name only: 7.8 months) and were more likely to be female, non-Hispanic White, nondiabetic, and to live in areas of lower socioeconomic deprivation compared to patients who used only brand-name drugs. Between January 2021 and December 2024, documentation of compounded semaglutide and tirzepatide use in US primary care settings appeared lower than surveys reporting that approximately 23% of patients using these medications received them from compounders. This suggests that many patients may access these medications outside of coordinated care. During drug shortages from 2022 to 2024, many patients turned to compounded formulations of popular weight-loss medications semaglutide (Ozempic/Wegovy) and tirzepatide (Mounjaro/Zepbound) made by specialty pharmacies. We analyzed medical records from over 153 000 patients across the United States who used these medications to understand how often primary care doctors knew their patients were using compounded formulations. We found that only 8.3% of patients had documented use of compounded formulations in their medical records, far lower than previous surveys suggesting 23% of users get these medications from nontraditional sources like telehealth companies or aesthetic clinics. Patients using compounded formulations were more likely to be white, female, nondiabetic, and live in wealthier areas compared to those using brand-name versions. They also used the medications for longer periods. This gap between documented use and actual use suggests many patients are getting these medications outside their regular healthcare system, which could create safety concerns since doctors may not know about all the medications their patients are taking or be able to monitor for side effects properly.",2025,Oct,Pharmacoepidemiology and drug safety,Nathaniel Hendrix; Esther E Velásquez; Harry Pham; Andrew Bazemore,2963,True,2025-10-01
41062981,Retrospective study: analysis of risk factors and construction of prediction model for pancreatic steatosis.,"Pancreatic steatosis, closely related to various metabolic diseases has no unified standard for the diagnosis. The purpose of this study was to construct and validate a risk prediction model of pancreatic steatosis. 854 cases admitted to Xi'an Mei Zhao physical examination center were divided into modeling set (n = 598) and validation set (n = 256) according to the ratio of 7:3, and the risk prediction model was constructed and validated based on the risk factors. Of 598 cases in modeling set, 232 were in the pancreatic steatosis group and 366 were in the non pancreatic steatosis group. There were significantly statistical differences in Age, Gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), Glucose (GLU), Total Cholesterol (TC), Triglycerides (TG), High-Density Lipoprotein (HDL), Low-Density Lipoprotein (LDL), Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST), Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT), Ratio of Aspartate Aminotransferase to Alanine Aminotransferase (AST/ALT), Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD), Pancreas computed tomography (CT) value, Spleen CT value, Liver CT value as well as Pancreas/Spleen CT value (P < 0.05) between pancreatic steatosis cases and non pancreatic steatosis cases. Cox regression showed that Age (97.5% CI 0.981-1.030), BMI (97.5% CI 1.198-1.436), GLU (97.5% CI 0.921-1.521), TC (97.5% CI 0.800-2.130), HDL (97.5% CI 0.074-0.649), LDL (97.5% CI 0.603-1.877), AST/ALT (97.5% CI 0.241-0.917), Pancreas CT value (97.5% CI 0.788-0.904), Liver CT value (97.5% CI 0.962-1.015), and Pancreas/Spleen CT value (97.5% CI 0.001-0.649) were independent risk factors for pancreatic steatosis (P < 0.05). Based on above variables, a pancreatic steatosis model was successfully constructed, the validation results showed the model had good credibility and predictive value. Age, BMI, GLU, TC, HDL, LDL, AST/ALT, Pancreas CT value, Liver CT value, Pancreas/Spleen CT value are risk factors for pancreatic steatosis, and this model can identify the patients at high risk of pancreatic steatosis.",2025,Oct,BMC gastroenterology,Wanli Zan; Jingxin Yang; Yi Zhou,1993,True,2025-10-01
41171731,Comparative mortality outcomes in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease subtypes in the United States.,"In 2023, experts from the European and American regions proposed the concepts of steatotic liver disease (SLD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). MASLD was proposed as a replacement for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). We compared the long-term outcomes of patients with MASLD, NAFLD, and various subtypes of SLD. We conducted a retrospective study using the NHANESIII database. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for all-cause mortality and cause-specific mortality among patients with subtypes of SLD, MASLD, and NAFLD. During a follow-up period of 31 years (median 25 years), the adjusted risks of all-cause death for patients with MASLD was 1.19 (95% CI 1.06-1.34; P = 0.006) vs. the non-SLD group. There was a moderate level of consistency between MASLD and NAFLD (Cohen's kappa coefficient of 0.62545). Advanced fibrosis was the most serious risk factor for all-cause mortality in MASLD, and high C-reactive protein concentration was the most serious risk factor for all-cause mortality in NAFLD, followed by type 2 diabetes. MASLD is associated with a higher risk of all-cause mortality, and this association is independent of patients' demographic or metabolic characteristics, despite a relatively small hazard ratio. Our research findings further support that MASLD is a pathological disease related to liver disease itself. Therefore, redefining NAFLD as MASLD may help improve our understanding of predictive factors that increase the risk of death.",2025,01,PloS one,Pengwei Zhang; Sijia Yang; Rong Hu; Tianfang Peng; Peipei Yu; Yijun Zeng; Chunhong Ye; Panpan Wang; Xianhui Dong; Zhiying Che,1580,True,2025-01-01

This was a single-arm, multicentre, prospective study. Among 80 consecutive patients with MASLD and T2DM who newly received oral semaglutide, 70 completed 48-week oral semaglutide treatment as scheduled and were included in an efficacy analysis. Dose adjustments of oral semaglutide were determined by each physician while monitoring efficacy and adverse events. Significant improvements in body weight, liver enzymes, lipid profile, and glycaemic control were found at 48 weeks compared with baseline values (all p < 0.01). Controlled attenuation parameter values significantly decreased from baseline to 48 weeks (p < 0.01). Changes in alanine aminotransferase concentrations (r = 0.37, p < 0.01) and controlled attenuation parameter values (r = 0.44, p < 0.01) were significantly correlated with changes in body weight. Liver fibrosis markers, such as type IV collagen 7S, Wisteria floribunda agglutinin-positive Mac-2-binding protein, fibrosis-4 index, and liver stiffness measurement, significantly decreased from baseline to 48 weeks (all p < 0.01). The most common adverse events were Grades 1-2 transient gastrointestinal symptoms, such as nausea (23 patients, 28.8%), dyspepsia (12, 15.0%) and appetite loss (4, 5.0%).

40136408,Drug Pipeline for MASLD: What Can Be Learned from the Successful Story of Resmetirom.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its progressive form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), represent a growing global health problem linked to obesity, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. MASLD often leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, therapeutic options are limited, emphasizing the need for novel, targeted pharmacological interventions. Resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR-β) agonist, offers a promising approach by specifically enhancing hepatic metabolism while minimizing systemic effects. Clinical trials have demonstrated its capacity to reduce hepatic triglyceride accumulation and improve lipid profiles. Early- and advanced-phase studies, including the MAESTRO program, highlight significant reductions in hepatic fat content and favorable impacts on noninvasive biomarkers of fibrosis with minimal side effects. This review highlights evidence from pivotal studies, explores resmetirom's mechanism of action, and compares its efficacy and safety with other emerging therapeutic agents. While resmetirom marks a breakthrough in non-cirrhotic MASH management, further long-term studies are essential to fully evaluate its clinical benefits and potential regulatory approval for broader use in MASLD and MASH.",2025,Feb,Current issues in molecular biology,Elizabeta Knezović; Marija Hefer; Suzana Blažanović; Ana Petrović; Vice Tomičić; Nika Srb; Damir Kirner; Robert Smolić; Martina Smolić,1337,True,2025-02-01
39439647,"Resmetirom: A Systematic Review of the Revolutionizing Approach to Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis Treatment Focusing on Efficacy, Safety, Cost-Effectiveness, and Impact on Quality of Life.","There has been a rise in the prevalence of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a subset of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) with an ongoing increase in the prevalence of linked conditions such as obesity, type II diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome. To date, there are no specific drugs that are approved for the treatment of NAFLD/NASH. With the recent discovery of association between subclinical hypothyroidism and NASH, various trials exploring treatment options for NASH using thyroid hormone derivatives led to the discovery of resmetirom (MGL-316) with high affinity to thyroid hormone receptors (THRs) targeting the liver. Following standardized guidelines, a systematic review was performed on the safety, efficacy, and other practical aspects of resmetirom in the treatment of NASH. Advanced search was carried out using the MeSH search strategy and appropriate keywords in major databases using various inclusion and exclusion criteria. The search was narrowed down to seven high-quality articles: four randomized control trials (RCTs), and three reviews to be included in the current study. The online database search yielded 62 articles, out of which six high-quality articles were selected to be included in the current systematic review after deleting duplicates and screening for irrelevant titles, and articles. Out of the three RCTs, two of them assessed the safety and efficacy of resmetirom, while the remaining RCT assessed the impact on health-related quality of life with resmetirom on patients with NASH. resmetirom (MGL-316) is a thyroid hormone derivative with high affinity to THRs targeting the liver and acts by improving mitochondrial oxidation, and lipophagy in the hepatic cell line. All the trials suggested in favor of resmetirom with a decrease in NASH fibrosis score by at least two points, along with reduction in hepatic fat content (minimum relative reduction of 20%), liver volume by 61%, improving secondary outcomes such as low-density lipoprotein-C, apolipoprotein-B, triglycerides, and hepatic enzymes with greater reduction in the study groups treated with higher doses of resmetirom with no significant increase in adverse events. Resmetirom was found to improve patient-reported outcomes, and thereby quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) in 12 weeks while being cost-effective compared to placebo at a willingness-to-pay threshold of US$100,000 up to a daily threshold of US$72.00, and an effective incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of US$53,925 per QALY gained. After carefully analyzing the available data by our team members, it could be concluded that resmetirom holds a strong potential to be implemented as a drug of choice in treating NAFLD/NASH in the coming years with proven efficacy, safety while being cost-effective, and also reducing secondary co-morbidities by improving cardiovascular risk factors. The results can be best achieved when combined with conventional approaches such as weight loss and dietary modifications. Long-term safety and sustainability of the achieved results are yet to be confirmed with large-scale clinical trials. However, resmetirom is still an investigational drug and could be expected to be available for clinical practice in the near future.",2024,Sep,Cureus,Parikshit Bittla; Sai Pavitra Paidimarri; Shriya Ayuthu; Yashkumar D Chauhan; Moyal Z Saad; Amna A Mirza; Safeera Khan,3255,True,2024-09-01
41117973,Effectiveness and safety of combining SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 receptor agonists in individuals with type 2 diabetes: a systematic review and meta-analysis of cohort studies.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) reduce cardiorenal risk in type 2 diabetes. However, the effect of combining these drugs remains uncertain. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the potential effectiveness and safety of combination therapy compared with monotherapy in individuals with type 2 diabetes. We systematically searched PubMed and Embase from inception to 1 May 2025 for cohort studies comparing the effect of combination therapy with SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA monotherapy on (cardiovascular) mortality and cardiovascular or kidney endpoints in individuals with type 2 diabetes. Studies enrolling individuals with type 1 diabetes or a maximum follow-up of less than 1 year were excluded. The primary outcome was a composite of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure, a kidney composite endpoint and serious adverse events. Risk of bias was assessed with ROBINS-I. Risk ratios (RRs) and 95% CIs were pooled in random effects meta-analyses. Certainty of evidence was assessed using Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE). We included 18 cohort studies (1,164,774 participants). In cohort studies, combination therapy was associated with a lower risk of MACE (RR 0.56 [95% CI 0.43, 0.71]; low certainty of evidence) and the kidney composite endpoint (RR 0.48 [95% CI 0.32, 0.73]; very low certainty of evidence) relative to SGLT2 inhibitor or GLP-1 RA monotherapy. Combination therapy was also associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality (RR 0.50 [95% CI 0.40, 0.63]; low certainty of evidence), cardiovascular mortality (RR 0.26 [95% CI 0.16, 0.43]; low certainty of evidence) and hospitalisation for heart failure (RR 0.67 [95% CI 0.64, 0.71]; moderate certainty of evidence). Although safety data could not be pooled due to lack of events, no differences were observed in the risk of severe hypoglycaemia, diabetic ketoacidosis, genitourinary infections and gastrointestinal side effects. No data were reported on the risk of serious adverse events or major adverse limb events. Observational studies suggest that combining an SGLT2 inhibitor and a GLP-1 RA in type 2 diabetes may lower the risk of MACE, all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, hospitalisation for heart failure and kidney composite endpoints compared with monotherapy with either drug. Of course, residual confounding cannot be overcome but results support the need for future randomised trials of combined vs monotherapy. PROSPERO registration no.

41003702,"Regorafenib modulates glucose metabolism, insulin/GLP-1 signaling, and tau pathology in an STZ-induced model of Alzheimer's disease.","Alzheimer's disease (AD), often described as ""type 3 diabetes"" due to its metabolic and neuroendocrine features, is marked by impaired glucose metabolism and insulin signaling. This study aimed to investigate whether regorafenib, a multi-kinase inhibitor, could modulate glucose metabolism, insulin/glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) pathways, and tau pathology in a streptozotocin (STZ)-induced rat model of AD. Male rats (n = 5-8/group) received intracerebroventricular STZ to induce AD-like pathology and were subsequently treated with regorafenib for two weeks. Cognitive function was assessed using the Y-maze and novel object recognition (NOR) tests. Glucose metabolism was evaluated via 18F-FDG micro-PET imaging and glucose tolerance tests. Serum and hippocampal markers of insulin, GLP-1, and tau phosphorylation were measured. Regorafenib-treated rats exhibited significant improvement in recognition memory in the NOR test, while enhancement in spatial working memory in the Y-maze did not reach statistical significance. Regorafenib improved glucose metabolism in both the brain and periphery, as demonstrated by imaging and tolerance testing. Treatment significantly increased serum insulin and GLP-1 levels, and reduced hippocampal hyperphosphorylated tau, although hippocampal gene expression of insulin and GLP-1 signaling pathways remained unchanged. Regorafenib may provide neuroprotective benefits in AD by improving glucose metabolism and reducing tau pathology. These findings suggest regorafenib as a potential novel therapeutic strategy for AD, though further research is needed to confirm its efficacy, assess long-term outcomes, and elucidate underlying mechanisms.",2025,Sep,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology,Sadegh Salarinasab; Afsaneh Asgari Taei; Neda Kaveh; Saeed Karima; Abdolrahim Nikzamir; Leila Dargahi,1688,True,2025-09-01
38851997,EASL-EASD-EASO Clinical Practice Guidelines on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is defined as steatotic liver disease (SLD) in the presence of one or more cardiometabolic risk factor(s) and the absence of harmful alcohol intake. The spectrum of MASLD includes steatosis, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH, previously NASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis and MASH-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). This joint EASL-EASD-EASO guideline provides an update on definitions, prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment for MASLD. Case-finding strategies for MASLD with liver fibrosis, using non-invasive tests, should be applied in individuals with cardiometabolic risk factors, abnormal liver enzymes, and/or radiological signs of hepatic steatosis, particularly in the presence of type 2 diabetes (T2D) or obesity with additional metabolic risk factor(s). A stepwise approach using blood-based scores (such as FIB-4) and, sequentially, imaging techniques (such as transient elastography) is suitable to rule-out/in advanced fibrosis, which is predictive of liver-related outcomes. In adults with MASLD, lifestyle modification - including weight loss, dietary changes, physical exercise and discouraging alcohol consumption - as well as optimal management of comorbidities - including use of incretin-based therapies (e.g. semaglutide, tirzepatide) for T2D or obesity, if indicated - is advised. Bariatric surgery is also an option in individuals with MASLD and obesity. If locally approved and dependent on the label, adults with non-cirrhotic MASH and significant liver fibrosis (stage ≥2) should be considered for a MASH-targeted treatment with resmetirom, which demonstrated histological effectiveness on steatohepatitis and fibrosis with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile. No MASH-targeted pharmacotherapy can currently be recommended for the cirrhotic stage. Management of MASH-related cirrhosis includes adaptations of metabolic drugs, nutritional counselling, surveillance for portal hypertension and HCC, as well as liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis.",2024,Sep,Journal of hepatology,,2148,True,2024-09-01

39428045,Thyroid hormone receptor-β analogues for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH).,"The association between suboptimal thyroid function ((sub)clinical hypothyroidism or low-normal thyroid function) and the metabolic syndrome and MASLD (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease) has been clearly established. Furthermore, in MASLD, intracellular thyroid hormone concentrations are low and the activation of the thyroid hormone receptor (THR) is reduced. Administration of thyroid hormone has been shown to reduce liver triglycerides by stimulating fatty acid disposal through lipophagy and beta-oxidation, and to lower LDL-cholesterol. As thyroid hormone exerts its effects in many different organs, including the heart and bone, several drug candidates have been developed as selective thyromimetics for the THR-β nuclear receptor with potent and liver-targeted activity. Importantly, these compounds have reduced affinity for the THR-α nuclear receptor and tissue distribution profiles that differ from endogenous thyroid hormones, thereby reducing unwanted cardiovascular side effects. The most advanced compound, resmetirom, is an oral drug that demonstrated, in a large phase III trial in patients with MASH (metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), the ability to reduce liver fat, decrease aminotransferase levels and improve atherogenic dyslipidaemia with a good tolerability profile.

To compare risks of kidney, cardiovascular, and death outcomes among patients with type 2 diabetes initiating GLP-1RAs in the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) health system. This comparative effectiveness study used an active-comparator, new-user target trial-emulation design with national data linked among the VA, Medicare, and US Renal Data System. Participants were GLP-1RA-naive veterans with type 2 diabetes and without end-stage kidney disease treated with metformin who started liraglutide, semaglutide, or dulaglutide between January 1, 2018, and December 31, 2021. Data were analyzed from September 2024 to June 2025. Liraglutide, semaglutide, or dulaglutide. Kidney failure (sustained estimated glomerular filtration rate <15 mL/min/1.73 m2 or initiation of kidney replacement therapy), composite cardiovascular and kidney metabolic (CKM) events (kidney failure or major adverse cardiovascular events [MACE]; myocardial infarction, heart failure, or stroke/transient ischemic attack), MACE, all-cause death, and adverse gastrointestinal events (gastroparesis, intestinal obstruction, gallstones, acute cholecystitis, acute pancreatitis) were evaluated separately through March 31, 2023. Of 21 790 included veterans (mean [SD] age, 63.5 [10.8] years, 19 823 [91.0%] male), 5425 (24.9%), 10 838 (49.7%), and 5527 (24.9%) initiated liraglutide, semaglutide, and dulaglutide, respectively. In weighted Cox regression models, compared with initiation of semaglutide, liraglutide initiation had similar hazards for kidney failure (hazard ratio [HR], 0.93; 95% CI, 0.60-1.44), the CKM composite outcome (HR, 0.96; 95% CI, 0.84-1.10), and MACE (HR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.83-1.09). Results were similar with liraglutide vs dulaglutide and dulaglutide vs semaglutide comparisons. Liraglutide had significantly lower hazard of all-cause death compared with semaglutide under intent-to-treat analyses (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.69-0.99), which lost significance in per-protocol models. Compared with dulaglutide, liraglutide was associated with a lower risk of all-cause mortality in both the intent-to-treat (HR, 0.69; 95% CI, 0.58-0.83) and per-protocol (HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.31-0.82) analyses, but compared with semaglutide, dulaglutide had higher hazard of mortality only in the per-protocol model (HR, 1.72; 95% CI, 1.20-2.47). The only observed difference for the gastrointestinal adverse events was a decreased risk for gallstones and acute cholecystitis with dulaglutide vs semaglutide (gallstones: HR, 0.72; 95% CI, 0.54-0.95; acute cholecystitis: HR, 0.62; 95% CI, 0.39-0.99).

41078189,Correlation between Plasma Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 and Sarcopenia in Elderly Patients with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.,"Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chronic lung disease, commonly face challenges with skeletal muscle dysfunction and sarcopenia. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has been reported to be associated with skeletal muscle injury. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the correlation between plasma GLP-1 and sarcopenia in elderly patients with COPD. One hundred and thirty-eight elderly patients with COPD were selected and divided into sarcopenia group (n = 58) and non-sarcopenia group (n = 80). Plasma GLP-1 levels, lung function, and biochemical levels were measured. The relationship between lung function (FEV1%pred) and skeletal muscle index (SMI) was examined using Spearman's correlation test. Independent correlates with sarcopenia in COPD were screened in multifactorial logistic regression analysis. Linear correlation between SMI and GLP-1 was analyzed using restricted cubic spline (RCS). Plasma GLP-1 levels were higher in the sarcopenia cohort than in the non-sarcopenia cohort (p < 0.001). SMI showed a significant positive correlation with FEV1%pred, particularly more pronounced in females (rs = 0.448). Age, NLR, and elevated GLP-1 were independent risk factors for sarcopenia in COPD. There was a linear association, shown by the RCS curves, between elevated GLP-1 and reduced SMI (p < 0.001).

41052742,Targeted hepatic delivery of ezetimibe via red blood cell-coated nanoparticles for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease through inflammation modulation.,"This study investigates the potential of red blood cell (RBC) membrane-coated, ezetimibe-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles for targeted therapy of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). PLGA nanoparticles were fabricated and subsequently camouflaged with RBC membranes to enhance hepatic targeting. The nanoparticles were characterized for size, surface potential, and encapsulation efficiency. Physicochemical characterization revealed increased particle size upon membrane coating (PLGA: 221.2 ± 26.0 nm; RBC-PLGA: 255.2 ± 14.1 nm), corroborated by transmission electron microscopy. In vitro release kinetics were systematically evaluated, showing sustained drug release for both formulations. Biodistribution studies in rats demonstrated predominant hepatic accumulation of both nanoparticles, with higher liver deposition observed for RBC-PLGA (106.43 ± 40.08 µg) compared to uncoated PLGA nanoparticles (101.41 ± 34.15 µg). In vivo efficacy was assessed in a high-fat diet-induced NAFLD rat model. All ezetimibe-treated groups exhibited significant reductions in serum cholesterol levels, hepatic lipid accumulation, and liver enzyme activities. Metabolomics and lipidomics analyses further revealed that RBC-PLGA nanoparticles induced the most pronounced alterations in hepatic metabolic and lipid profiles. Moreover, studies demonstrated route-dependent modulation of key proteins implicated in NAFLD pathogenesis. Collectively, these findings suggest that RBC membrane-coated nanoparticles significantly enhance the liver-specific delivery and therapeutic efficacy of ezetimibe in NAFLD, while offering mechanistic insights into metabolic and lipidomic modulation associated with different administration routes.",2025,Oct,International journal of pharmaceutics,Ozgur Esim; Seyma Adatepe; Okan Ali Aksoy; Berk Alp Goksel; Tugba Yilmaz; Baris Baykal; Çigdem Yucel; Sevilay Erdogan Kablan; Cemil Can Eylem; Engin Kocak; Hakan Erdogan; Cansel Kose Ozkan; Emirhan Nemutlu; Ayhan Savaser; Yalçın Ozkan,1749,True,2025-10-01
41093057,A melanocortin 4- and glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor multiple agonist for the treatment of diabetes and obesity.,"Obesity and its sequelae cause significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. Current glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist-based treatments have significant side-effects associated with high rates of treatment discontinuation. Such concerns are greater still in children and adolescents. Thus, there remains a clinical unmet need to develop obesity and/or T2D mellitus therapies with significantly improved tolerability. Herein, we examined a polypharmacy approach combining melanocortin (MC) 4-, and GLP-1-receptor agonism in a single monomeric peptide based on α-MSH and Exendin-4 to bind and stimulate different peptide receptors in vitro, and to drive reductions in body weight and food intake in up to 7 weeks of treatment in comparison to semaglutide and tirzepatide as standard of care positive controls in diet-induced obese rats. Despite the monomeric peptide GLP-1-/MC4-receptor multiple agonist (KCEM1) being a non-lipidated, weaker GLP-1R agonist compared to semaglutide and tirzepatide, reductions in calorie intake and body weight were similar in all three groups after daily subcutaneous injections of the three peptides. In addition, KCEM1 offered superior glycemic control during glucose tolerance testing. In gene expression analyses, KCEM1, but not semaglutide or tirzepatide, significantly increased expression of glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4) and key glycolysis enzyme Pgk1 in skeletal muscle, while it reduced genetic markers of inflammation in different tissues, including inflammatory markers IL-6 and TNF-α in liver tissue. Furthermore, KCEM1 lowered hepatic lipid content and improved metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) scoring. Overall, these data extend emerging concepts around the use of multi-receptor polypharmacy to treat metabolic syndrome.",2025,Oct,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,Emily F Ashlaw; Clinton T Elfers; Kylie S Chichura; Isabella Chavez Miranda; Aelish McGivney; Oleg G Chepurny; George G Holz; Ginger Mullins; Laura J den Hartigh; Yongjun Liu; Christian L Roth; Robert P Doyle,1808,True,2025-10-01
40982727,Semaglutide impacts skeletal muscle to a similar extent as caloric restriction in mice with diet-induced obesity.,"Semaglutide is a GLP-1 receptor agonist that is highly efficacious in reducing food intake and body weight. While semaglutide reduces adipose tissue, there is also a loss of lean mass including skeletal muscle, though it is unclear whether this translates to a loss of muscle function. The effect of discontinuation of semaglutide on rebound weight gain and shifts in body composition is also not well understood. We investigated the impact of semaglutide and matched caloric restriction on body composition in mice with diet-induced obesity. Mice were treated with semaglutide or fed a calorie-matched diet for 4 weeks. Semaglutide and pair-feeding induced significant weight loss with a concomitant reduction in energy expenditure. Weight loss was greater with semaglutide than caloric restriction, despite matched energy intake. Muscle transcriptomic analyses revealed distinct molecular responses between semaglutide and pair-feeding. In a follow-up experiment, semaglutide and pair-feeding was discontinued after 4 weeks, and body weight and food intake were tracked for 6 weeks. At the end of the withdrawal period there was a loss of treatment effects. Lean and fat mass rebounded to baseline levels at the end of the withdrawal period. Muscle size and strength were also comparable between groups. These findings demonstrate that semaglutide reduces muscle size and strength to the same extent as caloric restriction but may be more effective at promoting fat loss. Interestingly, the loss of lean mass and skeletal muscle recovered following treatment discontinuation. KEY POINTS: Semaglutide results in greater weight loss than caloric restriction. Semaglutide treatment increases fat loss compared with caloric restriction. Muscle mass and strength is reduced to a similar extent by semaglutide and restricted feeding.",2025,Sep,The Journal of physiology,S Jeromson; B Baranowski; M Akcan; B D Waters; K Eisner; A Bellucci; S Trang; A Abolhassani; M A Tello-Palencia; A Schweitzer; B Stefanska; C J Mitchell; David C Wright,1830,True,2025-09-01

We assessed the effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on 10-year CVR in a primary prevention cohort. In this 44-week prospective, non-randomized study, 135 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity were included across 13 healthcare centers. The primary endpoint was the change in 10-year cardiovascular risk, estimated using the AHA ASCVD Risk Estimator Plus tool at baseline and week 44. Secondary endpoints included weight loss, HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, and lipid profiles. Patients received subcutaneous semaglutide, oral semaglutide, dulaglutide, or other GLP-1RAs. In the primary prevention cohort (n = 105), mean 10-year CVR decreased by 3.28 percentage points, a relative reduction of 13.45 % (p < 0.001). Subcutaneous semaglutide showed the greatest weight loss (-8.1 kg), followed by oral semaglutide (-6.5 kg) and dulaglutide (-5.6 kg). HbA1c improved from 8.1 % to 6.6 %, and fasting plasma glucose decreased by 45.8 mg/dL (both p < 0.001).

41080335,Comparative Effectiveness of Sodium-Glucose Cotransporter 2 (SGLT-2) Inhibitors and Glucagon-like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists in Reducing Adverse Cardiovascular Events in Type 2 Diabetes.,"Background Cardiovascular outcome trials have demonstrated that sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT-2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) reduce cardiovascular risk in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, their comparative effectiveness remains uncertain, particularly in South Asian populations. Objective The objective of this study was to compare the effectiveness of SGLT-2i and GLP-1 RA in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and improving cardiometabolic parameters in patients with T2D. Methods This retrospective study was conducted at the Combined Military Hospital, Lahore, Pakistan, over 24 months. A total of 200 patients with T2D were included, with 100 in the SGLT-2i group and 100 in the GLP-1 RA group. Baseline characteristics, including age, sex, duration of diabetes, HbA1c, body mass index (BMI), hypertension, and dyslipidemia, were comparable between groups. The primary outcome was the incidence of MACE, while secondary outcomes included changes in HbA1c, blood pressure, lipid profile, and BMI. Statistical analysis included chi-square tests, independent t-tests, Kaplan-Meier survival curves, and Cox regression. Results Over a mean follow-up of 18.6 ± 3.1 months, MACE occurred in 18% of patients in the SGLT-2i group compared to 30% in the GLP-1 RA group (χ² = 4.26, p = 0.04). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed higher event-free survival with SGLT-2i (log-rank χ² = 4.71, p = 0.03). Cox regression revealed a 42% reduced risk of MACE with SGLT-2i (HR 0.58, 95% CI 0.35-0.95, p = 0.03). Secondary outcomes indicated greater reductions in systolic blood pressure (p = 0.02) and BMI (p = 0.01) with SGLT-2i, while HbA1c reduction was slightly greater with GLP-1 RA but not statistically significant (p = 0.42). Lipid changes favored GLP-1 RA but were not significant. Conclusion SGLT-2 inhibitors demonstrated superior effectiveness compared to GLP-1 receptor agonists in reducing cardiovascular risk, lowering systolic blood pressure, and promoting weight loss in Pakistani patients with T2D. These findings support the preferential use of SGLT-2i in high cardiovascular risk populations.",2025,Sep,Cureus,Syed Zakir Shah; Rahema Khan; Sadaf Moeez; Sanjay Kumar; Muhammad Umar Ejaz; Usman Aslam; Mian Waqar Mustafa; Mahwish Ashraf; Imtiaz Mustafa; Fahad Asim,2171,True,2025-09-01
41105209,Prevalence and Associated Factors of Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease in Patients with Inflammatory Bowel Disease: An Updated Global Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of over 1.5 Million Individuals.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) has become the most prevalent chronic liver condition worldwide, with its burden increasingly recognized among individuals with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). The complex interplay between chronic intestinal inflammation, metabolic dysregulation, and hepatic pathology has heightened concern about the susceptibility of IBD patients to NAFLD. This study aims to systematically evaluate the global prevalence of NAFLD among patients with IBD and to identify key demographic, geographic, clinical, and pharmacologic factors associated with its development. A comprehensive search of four electronic databases-PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science-was conducted up to January 21, 2025. Eligible studies included observational research reporting the prevalence of NAFLD in patients with IBD. Random-effects meta-analysis was used to estimate the pooled prevalence of NAFLD. In addition, subgroup analyses and meta-regression were conducted to investigate potential sources of heterogeneity and identify associated demographic, clinical, and geographic factors. A total of 64 studies comprising 1 532 811 individuals were included. The pooled global prevalence of NAFLD in IBD patients was 25.4% (95% CI: 23.1%-27.8%). Prevalence was higher in adults (26.0%, 95% CI: 24.0%-29.0%) than in pediatric patients (7.0%, 95% CI: 1.0-16.0). Among males and females, prevalence was 32.1% (95% CI: 29.3%-36.0%) and 22.9% (95% CI: 20.2%-25.7%), respectively. Among IBD subtypes, the prevalence was 21.4% in ulcerative colitis (UC; 95% CI: 15.2%-28.3%) and 22.8% in Crohn's disease (CD; 95% CI: 20.0%-25.0%). Geographic variation was substantial, ranging from 16.0% in Asia (95% CI: 10.0%-25.0%) to 32.0% in Europe (95% CI: 27.0%-38.0%) and Africa (95% CI: 10.0%-57.0%). NAFLD prevalence was also influenced by diagnostic method, with higher rates using transient elastography (38.0%, 95% CI: 27.0%-49.0%) and liver biopsy (37.0%, 95% CI: 17.0%-59.0%). By disease location, the highest NAFLD prevalence in CD was in patients with upper GI involvement (67.0%, 95% CI: 1%-99.0%), while the lowest was in ileo-colonic disease (21.0%, 95% CI: 12.0%-32.0%). For UC, prevalence ranged from 27.0% (95% CI: 17.0%-39.0%) in left-sided colitis to 18.0% (95% CI: 8.0%-29.0%) in proctosigmoiditis. No significant association with NAFLD was observed for any IBD medication analyzed, including 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA; OR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.69-1.05; P = .15), azathioprine (OR: 1.04, 95% CI: 0.78-1.40; P = .76), vedolizumab (OR: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.45-1.44; P = .48), Ustekinumab (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 0.58-1.82; P = .90), anti-TNF agents (OR: 1.20, 95% CI: 0.85-1.68; P = .28), and systemic corticosteroids (OR: 1.43, 95% CI: 0.89-2.32; P = .13). NAFLD is a common comorbidity among patients with IBD, affecting over one in four individuals, with higher prevalence observed in adults, males, and certain geographic regions. Variation by diagnostic modality and disease location was also noted; however, these subgroup findings are based on limited data and should be interpreted with caution. Overall, the results highlight the importance of incorporating liver health screening into routine IBD management, particularly for high-risk populations, and underscore the need for future prospective studies to refine risk stratification and management strategies.

40935652,Hepatic Insulin Resistance and Steatosis in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease: New Insights into Mechanisms and Clinical Implications.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) represents a progressive spectrum ranging from simple hepatic steatosis to steatohepatitis and fibrosis. Although insulin resistance (IR) plays a central role in metabolic diseases, in the liver, insulin- or substrate-driven de novo lipogenesis (DNL) promotes triglyceride accumulation through multiple complex regulatory mechanisms, including specific transcription factors, regardless of whether IR is primary or not. Elevated free fatty acids, resulting from increased adipose lipolysis, further augment hepatic lipid storage and contribute to IR and the progression of MASLD through lipotoxic intermediates such as diacylglycerols and ceramides, as well as other pathways. Numerous studies have identified DNL as a major, yet modifiable, contributor to MASLD. In addition, zonal differences in hepatic insulin signaling, non-classical insulin signaling pathways, and activation of the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 and protein kinase C pathways appear to be involved in the development of selective hepatic IR. Recently, new pharmacologic agents, including resmetirom, have shown promise in improving steatohepatitis and fibrosis in MASLD. Nevertheless, sustained weight loss through lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of MASLD prevention and therapy. Further mechanistic understanding of how IR and substrate overload promote DNL and hepatic fat accumulation is critical for developing effective treatments for MASLD.",2025,Sep,Diabetes & metabolism journal,Xuan Trong Truong; Dae Ho Lee,1512,True,2025-09-01

RNA-seq was used for screening, and rescue experiments were performed to validate the target gene of the drug. A NASH mouse model was used to further elucidate the role and the underlying mechanism of resmetirom. Resmetirom effectively eliminated lipid accumulation and decreased triglyceride (TG) levels. In addition, repressed RGS5 in the NASH model could be recovered by resmetirom treatment. The silencing of RGS5 effectively impaired the role of resmetirom. In the NASH mouse model, obvious gray hepatization, liver fibrosis and inflammation, and increased macrophage infiltration were observed in liver tissues, while resmetirom almost returned them to normal conditions as observed in the control group. Pathological experimental data also confirmed that resmetirom has great potential in NASH treatment. Finally, RGS5 expression was suppressed in the NASH mouse model, but it was upregulated by resmetirom treatment, while the STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways were activated in NASH but inhibited by the agent. Resmetirom could improve NASH by recovering RGS5 expression and subsequently inactivating the STAT3 and NF-κB signaling pathways.",2023,Mar,International journal of molecular sciences,Xiaojing Wang; Liangjing Wang; Lin Geng; Naoki Tanaka; Bin Ye,1415,True,2023-03-01
41039650,Reasons for Discontinuation of Obesity Pharmacotherapy With Semaglutide or Tirzepatide in Clinical Practice.,"This study aimed to characterize the reasons for treatment discontinuation with injectable semaglutide or tirzepatide for obesity in regular clinical practice. This cross-sectional study used electronic health record data between January 2022 and December 2024 from a single integrated health system in Ohio and Florida. The primary reason for treatment discontinuation was examined in a randomly selected sample of adults with overweight or obesity and without type 2 diabetes who initiated injectable semaglutide or tirzepatide and discontinued treatment within the first year. We randomly selected 288 patients; 145 received semaglutide and 143 tirzepatide. Overall, 137 patients (47.6%) discontinued their medication due to cost or insurance-related issues, 42 (14.6%) due to inability to tolerate the side effects, 34 (11.8%) as they were unable to fill the medication due to shortages, 7 (2.4%) as they switched to a compounded medication, and 5 (1.7%) due to unsatisfactory weight loss; 31 (10.8%) discontinued for other reasons, and for 32 (11.1%) patients the discontinuation reason was not specified in the electronic health record. High cost or insurance-related issues are the most common reasons for treatment discontinuation with semaglutide or tirzepatide for obesity. Our findings highlight the need for policies to address cost and could inform discussions between healthcare providers and patients concerning cost and side effects.",2025,Oct,"Obesity (Silver Spring, Md.)",Hamlet Gasoyan; W Scott Butsch; Nicholas J Casacchia; Rebecca Schulte; Victoria Criswell; Jacqueline Fox; Holly Renner; Phuc Le; Jordan Alpert; Michael B Rothberg,1450,True,2025-10-01
41052630,Industry and consumer products as lead exposure sources among children across 3 regions in Ghana.,"The prevalence of childhood lead exposure in low- and middle-income countries is garnering growing international attention. However, there is limited national and subnational data on blood lead levels and contributing sources of exposure. Between November 2022 and January 2023, lead exposure sources were assessed for 288 children from across 9 communities in 3 regions of Ghana: Greater Accra (4 communities), Ashanti (3 communities), and the Northern Region (2 communities). Study areas were selected to capture populations living near formal and informal lead-related industry, as well as control areas without known industrial activities. Study participants were selected as a subset from a blood lead sampling effort conducted by the Ghana Health Service, in partnership with Pure Earth and UNICEF, which included 3227 children aged 12-59 months. Of all households included in the blood lead survey, 288 (9 %) were randomly selected for detailed assessments to identify potential sources of lead exposure. These home-based assessments included data collection on soil, dust, drinking water, paint, metal and ceramic cookware, cooking spices, cosmetics, jewelry, and toys. With the exception of drinking water, all elements of the assessments were carried out with a portable X-Ray Fluorescence analyzer. Concentrations of lead above 100 ppm in soil surrounding households were found to raise the risk of a child's blood lead levels exceeding 10 μg/dL by 20 times. The use of traditional eyeliner (chilo) increased this risk by more than 40 times. The disparate sources identified highlight the need for representative sampling and home-based investigations to prioritize interventions to reduce blood lead levels. In Ghana, it is evident that interventions are required on multiple fronts with the involvement of diverse stakeholders to address the high prevalence of elevated blood lead levels, including mitigating industrial pollution as well as tightening controls on consumer products.",2025,Oct,Environmental research,Emily Nash; Caroline Baylor; Blessing Enyonam Gbadago; Wilson Baaku; Esmond Wisdom Quansah; Ursula Berger; Stephan Bose-O'Reilly,1997,True,2025-10-01

41109556,Raman spectroscopic characterization of liver steatosis and fibrosis in a 2D and 3D in vitro thyroxine-treated hypothyroid cellular model.,"Primary hypothyroidism has been associated with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and, potentially, increased liver fibrosis risk. Although T4-analog drug is one of the standard treatments, its molecular effects on the liver are not fully understood. To elucidate drug-induced hepatic metabolic changes, chronic human 2D and 3D hypothyroid models were developed. The effects of T4 were assessed by Raman spectroscopy and complementary biological techniques to observe lipid and fibrotic changes. In vitro chronic hypothyroidism caused lipid droplet (LDs) accumulation in liver cells which was unaffected by T4 therapy. Notably, TSH and T4 influenced TG fatty acid saturation in different ways: T4-exposed cells accumulated monounsaturated fatty acids at the expense of saturated fatty acids. In the case of liver fibrosis, TSH treatment activated hepatic stellate cells as evidenced by increased collagen secretion and decreased LD content, regardless of T4 co-treatment. Data confirmed that TSH induced pro-inflammatory changes leading to higher inflammasome levels in a 3D liver model. These findings indicate the detrimental effects of elevated TSH levels, and it is worth noting that T4 administration does not reverse the excess of hepatic lipid overload but has the ability to alter its lipid composition. Furthermore, T4 administration did not reverse TSH-induced hepatic fibrogenesis in the hypothyroid cell models. Because micro-Raman spectroscopy is currently restricted to 2D/3D in-vitro systems, further validation in intact tissue and in vivo is warranted. In conclusion, our results highlight the importance of further research into the molecular pathways associated with chronic liver injury in patients with chronic hypothyroidism.",2025,Oct,Molecular and cellular endocrinology,S Maurotti; B Scopacasa; F Scionti; R Pujia; M Frosina; A Mirarchi; N Geirola; R Mare; T Montalcini; P Candeloro; L Tirinato; A Pujia,1771,True,2025-10-01
41150795,Empagliflozin Attenuates Liver Inflammation and Fibrosis in NAFLD: Evidence from Mendelian Randomization and Mouse Experiments.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent chronic liver disorder and a major global health challenge, yet effective pharmacological therapies are lacking. Empagliflozin, a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, has shown systemic metabolic and anti-inflammatory benefits, but its liver-specific molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. In this study, we evaluated the therapeutic effects of empagliflozin in a diet-induced mouse model of NAFLD, supported by Mendelian randomization analysis. Histological examination, serum biochemistry, and hepatic triglyceride quantification demonstrated that empagliflozin markedly attenuated hepatic steatosis and improved liver injury indices. At the molecular level, empagliflozin suppressed NF-κB-mediated inflammatory signaling and significantly downregulated fibrotic markers including α-SMA and COL1A1, while modulating TIMP-1 and MMP-9 expression. Collectively, these findings reveal that empagliflozin ameliorates NAFLD by inhibiting inflammatory and fibrotic molecular pathways, highlighting its potential as a mechanism-based therapeutic option for NAFLD.",2025,Oct,Current issues in molecular biology,Chao Fu; Lijiao Deng; Xiaochan Zhu; Bin Wang; Bin Hu; Huan Xue; Qingxuan Zeng; Yi Zhang,1142,True,2025-10-01
41076575,Effect of GLP-1 receptor agonists on body composition.,"Obesity is present in up to 85% of individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and poses a major therapeutic challenge. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), initially developed for T2DM, are now widely used for obesity management and increasingly recognized for their impact on body composition beyond weight reduction. This review summarizes evidence on the effects of GLP-1RAs, particularly semaglutide and liraglutide, on fat mass, lean body mass (LBM), visceral adipose tissue (VAT), and resting energy expenditure (REE). Clinical trials and meta-analyses show GLP-1RAs achieve marked fat mass loss, preferentially reducing VAT, with modest proportional declines in LBM. Despite reductions in absolute LBM, relative preservation or improvement is observed, and REE is largely maintained, with some reports of increases during prolonged therapy. In both diabetic and nondiabetic populations, GLP-1RAs improve metabolic health without accelerating sarcopenia. Rodent data support protective muscle effects through anti-inflammatory and myogenic mechanisms. Withdrawal, however, predictably results in weight regain, primarily as fat mass, highlighting the importance of continued therapy or supportive lifestyle strategies. GLP-1RAs confer favourable body composition outcomes, with clinical implications for obesity, sarcopenic obesity, and broader metabolic disease management.",2025,Dec,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",Akhila Bhandarkar; Sowrabha Bhat; Nitin Kapoor,1404,True,2025-12-01
41094697,Exploring the role of gut microbiota in inflammatory bowel disease patients comorbid with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) commonly coexists with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Despite metabolic factors being less involved, IBD patients exhibit a higher risk of developing NAFLD compared to non-IBD individuals. Given the shared role of gut dysbiosis in the pathogenesis of both diseases, this study investigated the involvement of gut microbiota and associated metabolic pathways in IBD-associated NAFLD (COMO). A retrospective analysis of clinical profiles from 490 IBD, 89 NAFLD, and 68 COMO patients was conducted. Fecal samples from 30 IBD, 32 NAFLD, 26 COMO patients and 29 healthy controls were prospectively collected and subjected to 16 S rRNA gene sequencing for microbial community analysis and functional pathway prediction. Subsequently, machine learning modeling was employed for feature importance analysis and identification of COMO patients. Demographic analysis revealed that COMO patients developed NAFLD earlier than NAFLD alone, with fewer metabolic associations with hypertension, hyperlipidemia and glucose dysregulation. Compared with IBD and NAFLD groups, COMO microbiota exhibited lower alpha diversity, with beta diversity aligning with IBD but distinct from NAFLD group. Shared microbial signatures included increased Lactococcus and decreased Coprococcus 3 and Ruminococcus 2, which was correlated with 11 metabolic pathways: five vitamin B pathways (thiamine, vitamin B6, biotin, folate and riboflavin), isoflavonoid, caffeine, phosphonate, cyanoamino acid, lipoic acid and ubiquinone pathways. Integrated microbial-metabolic machine learning models (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and XGBoost) achieved AUC of 0.818-0.864 for COMO identification. Our findings implicate microbiota-mediated metabolic reprogramming in IBD-associated NAFLD pathogenesis, highlighting potential therapeutic targets for the treatment and prevention of NAFLD in IBD.",2025,Oct,Gut pathogens,Jiachen Hu; Chen Zhou; Lu Zhang; Yuzhu Chen; Jun Li; Junxia Li; Liping Duan,1927,True,2025-10-01
38797152,Roflumilast ameliorates GAN diet-induced non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by reducing hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in ob/ob mice.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a highly prevalent progressive liver disease. Currently, there is only one drug for NAFLD treatment, and the options are limited. Phosphodiesterase-4 (PDE-4) inhibitors have potential in treating NAFLD. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effect of roflumilast on NAFLD. Here, we fed ob/ob mice to induce the NAFLD model by GAN diet. Roflumilast (1 mg/kg) was administered orally once daily. Semaglutide (20 nmol/kg), used as a positive control, was injected subcutaneously once daily. Our findings showed that roflumilast has beneficial effects on NAFLD. Roflumilast prevented body weight gain and improved lipid metabolism in ob/ob-GAN NAFLD mice. In addition, roflumilast decreased hepatic steatosis by down-regulating the expression of hepatic fatty acid synthesis genes (SREBP1c, FASN, and CD36) and improving oxidative stress. Roflumilast not only reduced liver injury by decreasing serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) levels, but also ameliorated hepatic inflammation by reducing the gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, IL-1β, and IL-6). Roflumilast lessened liver fibrosis by inhibiting the expression of fibrosis mRNA (TGFβ1, α-SMA, COL1a1, and TIMP-1). Collectively, roflumilast could ameliorate NAFLD, especially in reducing hepatic steatosis and fibrosis. Our findings suggested a PDE-4 inhibitor roflumilast could be a potential drug for NAFLD.",2024,Aug,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Bin Wang; Xiaochan Zhu; Siting Yu; Huan Xue; Lijiao Deng; Yushan Zhang; Yi Zhang; Yunfeng Liu,1468,True,2024-08-01

As some patients with MASH have been prescribed SC semaglutide for the treatment of comorbid type 2 diabetes and/or obesity, this study assessed real-world 72-week treatment patterns among patients with MASH. In a linked electronic health records (Veradigm Network EHR) and claims (Komodo Health) dataset, adults (≥18 years old) with a MASH diagnosis, who initiated treatment with SC semaglutide between 7/1/2018 and 6/30/2023, were identified. Other causes of liver disease (eg, viral hepatitis) or severe complications (eg, cirrhosis) were excluded. The study period included ≥52 weeks before and ≥72 weeks after the first SC semaglutide claim. A subgroup analysis was conducted among those who received the brand approved for 2.4 mg/week dosage (SC semaglutide 2.4) and among people at risk for MASH. Patient characteristics and treatment patterns are reported. This study identified 6,537 patients with MASH, who initiated treatment with SC semaglutide, 358 of whom received only the brand approved for 2.4 mg/week dosage. Patients were ~50 years old, and a majority were female. Non-persistence occurred in 68.4% of the overall SC semaglutide cohort and 78.5% of the SC semaglutide 2.4 subgroup. The mean time to non-persistence was 24.8 (19.3) and 20.1 (16.9) weeks in the SC semaglutide and SC semaglutide 2.4 groups, respectively. In the SC semaglutide 2.4 subgroup, 182 patients (50.8%) reached the recommended dosage of 2.4 mg/week, and 28 (7.8%) reached the recommended dosage within the first 16 weeks and sustained that dosage for ≥56 weeks. Trends were similar among patients at risk for MASH.

40836732,"MASLD Pharmacotherapy: Current Standards, Emerging Treatments, and Practical Guidance for Indian Physicians.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), has become a significant public health issue worldwide, with a pronounced impact in India due to the escalating rates of obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) driving its prevalence. This condition spans a range of hepatic disorders, from uncomplicated steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), accompanied by differing levels of hepatic fibrosis, heightening the likelihood of progression to cirrhosis, liver cancer, and cardiovascular complications. While lifestyle modification remains the cornerstone of MASLD management, pharmacologic therapies are increasingly recognized as essential for patients with progressive disease or those at higher risk of complications. Recent insights into the pathogenesis of MASLD have led to the development of innovative therapies targeting key mechanisms such as hepatic steatosis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and hepatic fibrosis. Several pharmacological agents have shown encouraging results in clinical trials, including thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist resmetirom, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) like semaglutide, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists such as pioglitazone and saroglitazar, sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), and vitamin E. Furthermore, emerging therapies, including the dual incretin agonist tirzepatide and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) analogs, hold the potential to transform future treatment strategies. This review provides a comprehensive overview of current and evolving pharmacologic options for MASLD, with a focus on practical recommendations tailored for Indian physicians. A structured treatment algorithm for noncirrhotic MASLD (F0-F3 fibrosis) is presented, incorporating only drugs currently available in India and stratified based on diabetes status and hepatic fibrosis severity. Given India's vast and diverse patient population, ensuring access to cost-effective therapies remains a challenge, necessitating a pragmatic approach that balances efficacy, affordability, and real-world feasibility.

41140083,Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Boosts Plumbagin's Neuroprotection Against Rotenone-Induced Motor Deficits.,"Parkinson's disease (PD), a condition that involves neural degeneration, develops due to dopaminergic neuronal death in the substantia nigra pars compacta, resulting in reduced striatal dopamine levels. This shortage causes problems with movement and thinking. The neurodefensive response of GLP-1 is especially important in PD. Assessments have demonstrated the neuroprotective advantages of activating GLP-1 receptors in distinct models of PD, resulting in enhancements in motor as well as non-motor behaviour. These characteristics suggest that GLP-1 signalling could be a promising target for PD treatment. Moreover, plumbagin is the primary active component of Plumbago zeylanica L., a medicinal herb that is clinically used in China. Also, plumbagin is reported to have significant neuroprotective efficacy. In this study, male rats received rotenone (1.5 mg/kg; subcutaneously), followed by plumbagin (20 mg/kg; p.o.). The rats' motor abilities were assessed using the actophotometer, beam walk, rotarod, gait analysis, open field, grip strength, as well as bar catalepsy evaluation. In addition, the levels of dopamine, RAGE, and GLP-1 were measured. Plumbagin improved movement issues caused by rotenone, boosted dopamine and GLP-1 levels, as well as lowered RAGE levels in the brains of rats. The study highlights plumbagin's potential in treating PD by improving motor function, increasing dopamine and GLP-1 levels, and reducing RAGE levels in a rotenone-induced rat model. These findings suggest that plumbagin may offer neuroprotective effects through GLP-1 pathway activation, making it a promising candidate for future PD therapies. These outcomes imply that agents that activate GLP-1, such as plumbagin, present a promising strategy for creating treatments to safeguard against rotenone-induced motor disorders.",2025,Oct,Current protein & peptide science,Aanchal Verma; Ahsas Goyal,1830,True,2025-10-01
41155762,The Role of the Mediterranean Diet and Alcohol Consumption in Chronic Liver Disease Prevention: A Narrative Review.,"The traditional Mediterranean Diet (MedDiet) has consistently demonstrated robust benefits in reducing cardiovascular, metabolic, and oncologic risks. Its high content of anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds, particularly (poly)phenols, underscores why this dietary pattern has been extensively researched and widely adopted for managing various metabolic conditions. This article aims to conduct a narrative review of the association between the MedDiet (and its debated alcohol consumption pattern) and a reduced risk of liver disease, with a specific focus on the potential preventive role of the MedDiet on Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD), which is now the most prevalent chronic liver disease globally. To carry out this review, relevant articles were searched on PubMed and other databases. The evidence found contributed to identifying the gaps in knowledge and allowed for the main findings to be summarized. Available randomized controlled trials and prospective cohort studies consistently support the hypothesis that high adherence to the MedDiet effectively reduces hepatic fat content, improves liver enzyme levels, and mitigates fibrosis progression. Crucially, this dietary pattern simultaneously addresses the significantly high cardiovascular risk inherent in MASLD. Historically, low-to-moderate alcohol intake, particularly moderate red wine with meals, was assumed to be a beneficial component of the MedDiet. While some observational studies suggest potential cardiovascular benefits, implying a loss of some MedDiet benefits if alcohol is excluded, a growing body of evidence highlights a deleterious synergistic interaction between alcohol, visceral adiposity, hepatic steatosis, and metabolic dysfunction. Based on the available evidence, clinical guidelines recommend the MedDiet with exercise for the prevention and management of MASLD. However, the alcohol consumption in the Mediterranean is currently under strong controversy. Furthermore, recent guidelines now advise total abstinence in patients with advanced liver disease and caution even at earlier MASLD stages. Yet, these assertions are largely based on observational data, underscoring the need for large clinical trials to address this issue with first-level evidence.",2025,Oct,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",María Barbería-Latasa; Diego Martínez-Urbistondo; Miguel A Martínez-González,2297,True,2025-10-01

Key contributing factors include advancing age, long-standing disease duration, and suboptimal glycemic control, as well as insulin resistance and androgen deficiency-the latter being particularly common in men with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity. While numerous studies have investigated the effects of various antidiabetic therapies on diabetes-related ED, the results remain inconsistent, limiting definitive conclusions. In recent years, increasing attention has focused on a novel class of antidiabetic medications, namely glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs). These agents have become central to the treatment of T2D due to their potent glucose-lowering properties and well-documented benefits on cardiovascular outcomes, and weight loss.

41121265,Establishment of sex-specific liver transcriptomes and H3K9me3 profiles during sexual maturity: the impact of maternal obesity.,"The escalating prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is closely linked to rising obesity rates. Maternal obesity (MO) is associated with increased susceptibility to metabolic disorders, including MASLD, in the offspring. This elevated risk could be a consequence of epigenetic modifications established during fetal development, a period highly sensitive to the maternal diet. H3K9me3, a hallmark of heterochromatin, plays a vital role in development by silencing gene programs dispensable for differentiated cell types. This study investigated how MO influences gene expression and chromatin architecture in male and female offspring liver, in early postnatal live and upon sexual maturity. Female mice were fed a Western-style diet or a control diet before and throughout pregnancy and lactation. The offspring were weaned at 3 weeks and subsequently transitioned to a standard chow diet for 5 weeks. At 3 weeks, the liver transcriptomes of control offspring were similar between sexes. However, MO disrupted hepatic gene expression in both sexes, leading to the dysregulation of hundreds of genes and alterations in H3K9me3 binding patterns. By 8 weeks, as the mice reached sexual maturity, control offspring showed considerable sex-based gene expression divergence, with over 1,800 genes showing differential expression. These genes were predominantly involved in immune response regulation, cell adhesion and extracellular matrix organization, xenobiotic and glutathione-mediated detoxification, cholesterol metabolism, and lipid partitioning. Furthermore, thousands of differentially bound H3K9me3 peaks were observed between the 3- and 8-week time points. A significant fraction of these peaks were located on the X chromosome in females, suggesting a role in X inactivation. Remarkably, MO offspring displayed incomplete normalization of gene expression, H3K9me3 profiles, and hepatic lipid classes by week 8, underscoring the long-term impact of maternal diet on the genomic and metabolic landscape. Collectively, this study highlights inherent sex differences in liver gene expression, and suggests that H3K9me3 plays a role in establishing sex-specific liver function during sexual maturation. Moreover, MO disrupts these patterns, which are not fully corrected by 5 weeks of postnatal dietary normalization. The escalating prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is linked to the rising global rates of obesity. Maternal obesity (MO) increases the offspring’s susceptibility to severe metabolic disorders, including MASLD. This increased vulnerability may be due to changes in epigenetic modifications –changes in how genes are “packaged”, which affects their activity (expression). H3K9me3, a critical epigenetic modification, plays a vital role in proper development by silencing non-essential gene programs. Our study investigated how MO influences the gene expression and H3K9me3 patterns in male and female offspring livers. Female mice consumed a Western-style diet or a control chow diet before and throughout pregnancy/lactation. Offspring were weaned at 3 weeks, then transitioned to chow for 5 weeks. At 3 weeks, control offspring liver gene expression was largely similar across sexes. However, MO profoundly disrupted gene expression in both sexes, dysregulating hundreds of genes and significantly altering H3K9me3 patterns. By 8 weeks, upon reaching sexual maturity, control offspring exhibited substantial sex-based divergence in liver gene expression, impacting over 1,800 genes crucial for immune function, lipid metabolism, and detoxification. Notably, at 8 weeks, MO offspring displayed an incomplete recovery. Even after 5 weeks on a healthy diet, their liver gene expression, H3K9me3 profiles, and fat profiles remained partially abnormal. This highlights the impact of a mother’s diet on her offspring’s genomic and metabolic programming, with consequences that are not easily reversed.",2025,Oct,Biology of sex differences,Ajay K Yadav; Arianna Harris-Kawano; Romil Saxena; Guanglong Jiang; Jia Ji; Hongyu Gao; Kok Lim Kua; Núria Morral,4001,True,2025-10-01
41169340,Psychological and behavioral effects of GLP-1 and GIP agonists in weight loss: a comprehensive review.,"Obesity remains a major global health challenge, severely affecting metabolic and cardiovascular health. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) receptor agonists mark a significant breakthrough in diabetes and obesity management, significantly aiding in weight loss and glycemic control. Tirzepatide, a dual agonist for GLP-1 and GIP receptors, effectively promotes weight loss and improves metabolic parameters by influencing insulin secretion, appetite regulation, and gastric emptying. This review highlights the dual metabolic and psychological impacts of GLP-1 and GIP agonists in diabetes and obesity management, emphasizing the need for a holistic, patient-centered approach to optimize treatment outcomes. While GLP-1 and GIP agonists demonstrate significant metabolic benefits, their long-term use is often limited by gastrointestinal side effects and psychological impacts. These medications, while regulating appetite and food reward pathways, can also lead to mood disturbances and altered eating behaviors, potentially affecting patient adherence. A comprehensive strategy for obesity management using GLP-1 and GIP agonists must consider both metabolic and psychological factors. Future research should focus on elucidating the complex mechanisms underlying their psychological effects and integrating mental health considerations into therapeutic strategies. Personalized diet and exercise interventions, alongside pharmacological treatments, are crucial for enhancing both metabolic and psychological outcomes, ensuring a more sustainable and effective approach to managing obesity.",2025,Dec,Journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders,Fatima Ameer; Nicole Yañez Villacres; Daniel Bustos; Pari C Shah; Noble Appah; Galilee N Luzaya; Francesca Corradi; Ifeoluwa S Bakare; Juan D Trujillo; Maneeth Mylavarapu; Adetola Mowo-Wale; Alisson Barbosa Silva,1643,True,2025-12-01
41054677,Unmasking Semaglutide-Induced Gastroparesis: The Dangers of Rapid Dose Escalation in a Diabetic Patient.,"Gastroparesis is a chronic disorder characterized by delayed gastric emptying without mechanical obstruction, causing symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and abdominal discomfort. Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist used for type 2 diabetes, can slow gastric motility and induce gastroparesis. We present a case of a 48-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes, who developed persistent nausea and vomiting after resuming semaglutide at 2 mg subcutaneously once weekly without following the recommended stepwise titration schedule (typically initiated at 0.25 mg weekly with gradual escalation). Shortly thereafter, she developed acute kidney injury secondary to dehydration. Imaging also demonstrated left-sided colitis, for which she received antibiotic therapy. Gastroparesis was suspected due to semaglutide use. Treatment with metoclopramide and cessation of semaglutide resulted in symptom resolution and recovery. Thus, semaglutide-induced gastroparesis should be considered in diabetic patients presenting with gastrointestinal symptoms, especially with rapid dose escalation. Early recognition and discontinuation of the drug can lead to swift symptom resolution and prevent complications.",2025,Sep,Cureus,Rohan Singhal; Dheerja Sachdeva; Kevin Wortman Ii; Rekha Lall,1221,True,2025-09-01

Here, we sought to estimate the eligible U.S. adult population for resmetirom therapy, with secondary analysis focusing on individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). A cross-sectional analysis was conducted using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-March 2020 cycle. Two eligibility scenarios were examined: a liberal scenario requiring ALT >17 U/L for women or >20 U/L for men, controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) >280 dB/m, and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) >8 kPa; and a restrictive scenario requiring ALT >30 U/L for both sexes, CAP >280 dB/m, and LSM >10 kPa. The analysis incorporated sampling weights to generate nationally representative estimates. The study cohort included 7244 adults (mean age 49.08 y, 49.9% male) with a mean BMI of 29.61 kg/m², mean CAP 263.35 dB/m, and mean LSM 5.8 kPa. An estimated 8.3 million (95% CI: 6.6-9.9 million) adults met the liberal eligibility criteria, while 2.3 million (95% CI: 1.4-3.2 million) met the restrictive criteria. Patients meeting restrictive criteria were predominantly male (76.2% vs. 59.9%) and younger (mean age 46.7 vs. 48.3 y), with similar BMI (38.6 vs. 38.1 kg/m²). Among adults with T2DM, 3.5 million (95% CI: 2.4-4.5 million; 12.2%) met liberal, whereas 0.85 million (95% CI: 0.5-1.2 million; 3.0%) restrictive criteria.

41141001,The Effects of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) Receptor Agonists on Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome: A Scoping Review.,"Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is the most common endocrinopathy in reproductive-aged women worldwide; however, treatment modalities often lack cohesion due to its multifactorial pathophysiology. PCOS is suspected of inducing insulin resistance. Research has explored the use of newly developed incretin mimetics as standard therapy for insulin resistance in insulin-dependent tissues associated with PCOS. The aim of this review was to explore the classes of incretin mimetics, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or semaglutide, dual agonists of the GLP-1 receptor and gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) or tirzepatide, and a new triple agonist, or retatrutide (which is currently seeking Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval), and their suggested benefits as a treatment for PCOS. A literature review was conducted using EBSCO Medline and PubMed following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. All three classes of incretin mimetics showed significant improvement in weight loss and insulin sensitivity when compared to traditional pharmacological management with metformin and estradiol-progesterone combination pills in patients with PCOS. The added upregulation of GIP in dual-acting and triple-acting agonists, such as tirzepatide and retatrutide, respectively, resulted in greater reductions in weight loss and insulin sensitivity when compared to medications that acted at the GLP-1 receptor alone. Some research demonstrated symptom improvements specific to PCOS presentation, such as dysmenorrhea and the classic dysmorphic ovarian morphology. Further research is warranted to determine the exact mechanism behind how incretin mimetics may improve the hormonal dysregulation in patients with PCOS, as well as how to best use these medications in conjunction with the current standard of care treatments.",2025,Sep,Cureus,Mia Hudanich; Shannon N Smith; Amanda Marino; Suzanne I Riskin,1900,True,2025-09-01
40879614,Screening for MASLD and Advanced Fibrosis Among Patients With Obesity: A Cost-Effectiveness Analysis.,"The study aimed to compare the cost-effectiveness of various strategies for screening for MASLD-related advanced hepatic fibrosis (fibrosis stage > 2) using the fibrosis-4 index (FIB-4) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) by transient elastography (TE) in persons with obesity. We created a decision-analytic model comparing three screening strategies: no screening, TE, and FIB-4 followed by TE. We used a Markov transition model to track liver state, with prevalence and transition probabilities specific to the population with obesity. If MASLD was detected, patients were treated with resmetirom. We found an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of $234,781 (95% CI: $232,581, $235,608) when comparing TE to no screening with a 10-year interval. We note the ICER of $234,673 (95% CI: $234,033, $235,072) when comparing TE to FIB-4+TE. In multivariate simulations, we found no screening was most likely to be cost-effective for willingness-to-pay for QALY below approximately $250,000. Our results suggest routine screening for MASLD in obesity clinics is not cost-effective with resmetirom as the available treatment.

41063536,Phloretin Suppresses the mPTP Abnormal Opening via the SHP-2/JAK2/BAX Axis to Ameliorate Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.,"Mitochondrial dysfunction, particularly driven by aberrant mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP) opening, is a key pathogenic mechanism in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). This study demonstrates for the first time that phloretin (Pht), a natural apple-derived dihydrochalcone, effectively inhibits this pathology by targeting SHP-2. Pht modulates the SHP-2/JAK2/BAX signaling axis, significantly suppressing the pathological mPTP opening. This action preserves mitochondrial homeostasis, evidenced by restored mitochondrial membrane potential, improved ultrastructural integrity, and the prevention of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) leakage into the cytosol. By blocking mtDNA escape, Pht inhibits the cytosolic mtDNA-induced activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and its downstream inflammatory cascade. Consequently, Pht ameliorates hepatic lipid metabolic dysregulation and inflammation. These findings reveal a novel SHP-2/JAK2/BAX-mPTP-mtDNA-cGAS signaling cascade through which dietary Pht alleviates NASH-associated mitochondrial inflammation. This work provides a crucial mechanistic foundation and identifies potential targets for developing functional foods or interventions aimed at promoting mitochondrial homeostasis.",2025,Oct,Journal of agricultural and food chemistry,Yonghui Dong; Xue Wu; Jie Li; Jia Li; Yuan Lu; Caian He; Lin Han; Min Wang,1242,True,2025-10-01
39604664,Presence of Mood and/or Anxiety Disorders Does Not Affect Success of Weight Management Therapies in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and resultant steatohepatitis (MASH) have been linked to psychiatric comorbidities. The treatment of MASLD/MASH primarily relies upon weight loss, where achieving a 7% total body weight loss is recommended to improve steatohepatitis. We aimed to determine whether achieving a 7% total body weight loss (TBWL) in MASLD/MASH patients was significantly different in the presence of a mood and/or anxiety disorder in an interdisciplinary clinic that integrates weight management and hepatology care. We conducted a single center retrospective cohort study of MASLD/MASH patients segregated into those with an ICD-10 diagnosis of a mood and/or anxiety disorder to those without. The primary outcome was reaching a 7% TBWL at 12 months with univariable and multivariable logistic regression models used to identify treatments predicting a 7% TBWL. Secondary outcomes were noninvasive assessment of steatohepatitis improvement, including change in ALT and FIB-4 scores. Of 567 patients with MASLD/MASH, 366 (64.6%) had a mood and/or anxiety disorder. The presence of psychiatric disease was not a significant predictor of weight loss or any secondary outcome measures at 12 months. Significant predictors of achieving 7% TBWL at 12 months among all patients with MASLD/MASH included semaglutide, phentermine-topiramate, and bariatric surgery. Significant predictors of achieving 7% TBWL at 12 months in patients with MASLD/MASH and a psychiatric comorbidity included semaglutide, topiramate, phentermine-topiramate, and bariatric surgery. Both groups experienced similar improvements in hepatic outcomes. Our findings suggest that obesity management in patients with MASLD/MASH performs similarly in the presence of comorbid mood and/or anxiety disorders. Topiramate and phentermine may be particularly effective in this patient population, yet are underutilized in routine hepatology practice.",2025,Jan,Digestive diseases and sciences,Bryan Bollinger; Robert Cotter; Yanhong Deng; Ysabel Ilagan-Ying; Vikas Gupta,1953,True,2025-01-01
41053377,Sterile inflammation in MASH: emerging role of extracellular RNA and therapeutic strategies.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its advanced form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), are major global health issues involving metabolic dysfunction, hepatic lipotoxicity, and chronic inflammation. A key driver of MASH pathogenesis is sterile inflammation, a non-infectious immune response triggered by molecules that are released from injured or dying liver cells. These molecules termed as damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), which activate innate immune receptors, such as Toll-like receptors (TLRs), NOD-like receptors, and the cyclic GMP-AMP synthase-stimulator of interferon genes (cGAS-STING) pathway to encourage inflammatory signaling, cytokine production, immune cell recruitment, and ultimately fibrogenic activation in MASH. Sterile inflammation sits at the crossroads of metabolic injury and immune activation in MASH and drives disease progression from simple fat build-up to irreversible liver damage. Targeting these sterile inflammatory pathways appears to be an attractive approach for halting or reversing hepatic inflammation and fibrogenic activation in MASH. Extracellular RNAs (eRNAs) have recently been identified as potent DAMPs that trigger sterile inflammation in MASH by engaging in TLR3 signaling. Furthermore, RNase1-based treatments have been proposed as novel therapeutic strategies to interrupt the self-sustaining loop of inflammatory signaling induced by eRNA in MASH. In this review, we discuss the key molecular mechanisms that fuel sterile inflammation in MASLD/MASH, highlighting eRNA as novel therapeutic targets to restrict inflammation in MASH.",2025,Oct,npj metabolic health and disease,Sana Raza; Rukshana Mahamood; Pratik Medhe; Ambuj Shahi; Abhishek Yadav; Archana Tewari; Rohit A Sinha,1656,True,2025-10-01

This study examined factors associated with non-disclosure among recently-diagnosed PLWH at IeDEA study sites in Cameroon. We conducted a cross-sectional study of adults ≥ 19 years newly enrolling in HIV care at three Cameroon hospitals from January 2016 to June 2023 with recent (< 1 year) diagnoses and no evidence of prior HIV care. We used logistic regression to identify factors associated with non-disclosure of HIV status at the time of enrolment. Among 2880 participants, the overall prevalence of HIV status non-disclosure at enrolment was 34.4%, ranging from 48.0% among those enrolling on the day of diagnosis to 18.7% among those enrolling > 30 days after diagnosis. Men and single participants had higher odds of non-disclosure compared with women (aOR: 1.68; 95% CI 1.38, 2.04) and those who were married/living with a partner (aOR: 1.66; 95% CI 1.36, 2.02).

37771619,Update on Clinical Trials for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.,"Tremendous effort has been put forth over the past 2 decades in understanding the pathophysiology of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease/nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NAFLD/NASH). Although multiple potential targets for drug development exist, there have been no approved therapies for NAFLD/NASH. Lipotoxicity, owing to increased delivery of fatty acids to the liver, and hepatic de novo lipogenesis are key drivers of disease pathogenesis. Moreover, genetics, environmental factors, and comorbid conditions converge to determine disease progression in individual patients. Given the complexity and heterogeneity of disease pathogenesis, numerous therapeutic targets have emerged and have been tested in clinical trials. Early trial failures have provided key lessons and foundational insights to move the field forward. Current ongoing phase 3 trials and emerging phase 2 trials are reasons for optimism, and 2 drugs, obeticholic acid and resmetirom, are being evaluated for accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration this year.

Urinary iodine concentration (UIC) is closely related to diabetes and glucose metabolism, but studies on the relationship between UIC and MASLD in non-diabetic individuals are limited. Our purpose was to explore the associations between UIC and MASLD as well as liver fibrosis in the non-diabetic population. We analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) conducted from 2017 to 2020. Participants were categorized into three groups based on UIC (µg/L): low (< 100), normal(100–299), and high(≥ 300). Vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) was employed to measure the controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver stiffness measurement (LSM), which serve as indicators of MASLD and liver fibrosis, respectively. Multiple logistic regression was performed to evaluate the association between UIC and MASLD as well as liver fibrosis. The study included 1281 non-diabetic participants aged ≥ 20 years. We found that high UIC was associated with a lower MASLD risk (OR = 0.57, 95%CI: 0.37–0.86,  In non-diabetic individuals, high UIC is associated with a lower MASLD prevalence, suggesting potential dietary interventions for MASLD patients.

41088364,Engineered GLP-1R-targeting nanoplatforms: multimodal therapeutics in human diseases.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) is a versatile therapeutic target that regulates glucose homeostasis, cardiovascular function, neuroprotection, and immune responses. Native GLP-1 undergoes rapid enzymatic degradation, limiting its clinical utility. To overcome these challenges, engineered GLP-1 analogues and nanotechnology-enabled delivery systems have emerged. This review summarizes recent advances in GLP-1R-targeted nanoplatforms, including lipid nanoparticles, polymeric carriers, inorganic nanoparticles, and biomimetic scaffolds that improve peptide stability, prolong circulation half-life, and enable selective tissue targeting. Ligand engineering approaches, such as site-specific peptide conjugation and fatty acid modifications, enhance receptor affinity and targeting precision. Stimuli-responsive release strategies that respond to glucose levels, pH shifts, and redox conditions restrict drug activation to diseased microenvironments. Multifunctional theranostic constructs co-encapsulate imaging probes with therapeutics, permitting real-time monitoring of biodistribution and receptor engagement. We discuss key translational challenges, including scalable manufacturing processes, quality control of particle size, ligand density, and release kinetics, and long-term biosafety concerns associated with inorganic materials and immune activation. Variability in GLP-1R expression among patient populations influences delivery efficacy, motivating personalized strategies guided by artificial intelligence and digital twin modeling. Emerging applications in neurodegenerative disorders, oncology, cardiovascular disease and immunology demonstrate the expanding clinical potential of GLP-1R nanomedicines. By integrating insights from materials science, pharmacology and preclinical studies, this review provides a cohesive framework for the rational design, evaluation and clinical translation of next-generation GLP-1R-targeted nanotherapeutics.

Here, we review the mechanisms underlying inflammation in these settings and how they may contribute to pathology. Nutrient excess triggers immune activation through pattern recognition receptors and the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to interleukin (IL)-1β production and downstream cytokine cascades. Initially adaptive, this inflammation promotes tissue remodeling and metabolic compensation, but chronic activation contributes to insulin resistance, β cell dysfunction, and end-organ damage. We discuss the current therapeutic options, with a focus on glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, which, alone or combined with additional bioactive moieties, exert notable anti-inflammatory effects. Some effects of GLP-1 medicines are independent of glucose control or weight loss, and they are attributed to direct signaling via the immune GLP-1 receptor (GLP-1R) and, indirectly, via central nervous system circuits.

41138464,Predicting denitrification in groundwater utilizing redoxcline depth and aquifer thickness.,"Due to high nitrate concentrations, Flanders has been struggling to achieve satisfactory surface water quality in agricultural watersheds. To improve understanding of nitrate transfer from groundwater to surface water, this study estimated the fraction of nitrate load from groundwater recharge that reaches the surface water by inferring the extent of denitrification in the aquifer based on the depth of the redoxcline. Nitrate concentrations at catchment outlets were predicted by multiplying nitrate concentrations in groundwater recharge by the ratio of the thickness of the oxidized zone to the aquifer thickness. The location of the redoxcline was determined from the hydrochemistry data available from a regional network of multilevel groundwater wells. Four scenarios were developed to compare the effect of differing assumptions on nitrate inputs and aquifer thickness on the catchment outlet nitrate predictions. The ratio of oxidized to entire aquifer thickness (Hooghoudt equivalent) for the studied 86 catchments varied from 0.07 to 1.0, averaging 0.48. The results indicated that combining groundwater nitrate input from a Nutrient Emission Model (NEMO) for Flanders and the Hooghoudt equivalent aquifer thickness provided the best predictions.

41025406,"Shared mechanistic pathways of glucagon signalling: Unlocking its potential for treating obesity, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, and other cardio-kidney-metabolic conditions.","Glucagon is a pancreatic peptide hormone whose receptor (GCGR) is expressed in the liver, kidney, and, to a lesser extent, various other tissues. Glucagon is well known as the counterpart to insulin in glucose homeostasis. However, recent evidence has revealed other potential roles of glucagon, which include the regulation of amino acid metabolism via a liver-pancreatic alpha cell axis, stimulation of lipolysis and mitochondrial fat oxidation in the liver (and possibly in other tissues), reduction of caloric intake, and an increase in energy expenditure (at least in animal models). These advances in basic science-together with clinical trials that found GCGR antagonists increased body weight, hepatic fat, and serum lipids in people with type 2 diabetes-are driving the development of GCGR-based agonists for the treatment of obesity, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), and other cardio-kidney-metabolic diseases. Due to the hyperglycaemic effects of glucagon, these unimolecular compounds also incorporate moieties that activate the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor, which stimulates insulin secretion to lower blood glucose levels. In early clinical trials, several GCGR-based multi-agonists (mazdutide, survodutide [being developed by the sponsor of this review], retatrutide) demonstrated substantial efficacy for eliciting weight loss in people with obesity while improving liver health in those with MASLD. However, the physiological and molecular pathways modulated by chronic pharmacological activation of the GCGR in humans remain to be delineated, as do its potential risks. Thus, there is great interest in the ongoing phase 3 clinical trials of these compounds. As data for their safety and efficacy emerge, glucagon's role in energy regulation and lipid metabolism will become clearer, along with warranting a potential new therapeutic option for obesity and MASLD.",2025,Sep,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Guy W Neff,1927,True,2025-09-01

However, there is a lack of systematic evaluation of the pathogenesis of MASLD development and MASLD graft damage. As a multisystem disorder, the pathogenesis of MASLD is closely related to genetics, metabolic and endocrine disorders, imbalanced intestinal flora, abnormal hepatocyte homeostasis, and hepatic inflammation. Mutations or single nucleotide polymorphisms and epigenetic modifications in multiple genes increase a person's susceptibility to developing MASLD. Lipid accumulation is a central pathogenic driver, and intestinal microbiota and endocrine disorders can exacerbate steatosis and inflammation. These issues cause endoplasmic reticulum stress in hepatocytes, leading to apoptosis and promoting the recruitment and activation of immune cells. Ultimately, hepatic stellate cells are activated, resulting in liver fibrosis. These molecular and pathological changes are important causes of why a MASLD donor liver is likely to suffer ischemia-reperfusion injury and cold ischemic injury. Lipid deposition, microcirculation disturbance, and inflammation in the MASLD donor liver exacerbates ischemia-reperfusion-related damage. During transplantation, cold ischemia time should be minimized, and machine perfusion implemented and treatments for MASLD used after transplantation to protect the graft. This systematic review describes the pathogenesis of MASLD and the mechanism of MASLD donor liver damage to potentially increase the use of MASLD donor livers and provide strategies to preserve organ function.",2025,Dec,iLIVER,Chuheng Gou; Wenjie Zhang; Hao Xu; Hong Zhang; Rui Ding; Xuan Zhang,1763,True,2025-12-01
41137591,Dermatologic and Metabolic Benefits of Semaglutide in Psoriasis with Obesity: A Six-Month Prospective Cohort Study.,"Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease often associated with obesity and metabolic dysfunction, which may worsen disease severity. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, such as semaglutide, have shown metabolic and anti-inflammatory effects, but their impact on psoriasis in non-diabetic patients with obesity remains unclear. To evaluate the effects of a six-month semaglutide treatment on psoriasis severity and clinical, metabolic, inflammatory, and psychosocial parameters in patients with psoriasis and obesity. In this prospective cohort study, 43 patients received weekly semaglutide along with lifestyle counseling. Psoriasis severity (PASI), quality of life (DLQI), depressive symptoms (BDI), nutritional ultrasound, and biochemical markers were assessed baseline and after six months. Correlations between PASI improvement (ΔPASI) and baseline variables and their changes were analyzed, adjusting for age and weight loss. After six months, participants showed significant reductions in PASI (-48%), BMI, preperitoneal and superficial fat, along with improvements in DLQI, BDI, and metabolic markers. Baseline disease severity, depressive symptoms, insulin resistance, and preperitoneal fat were negatively associated with PASI improvement. These associations remained significant after adjustment (e.g., HOMA-IR, r = -0.82; preperitoneal fat, r = -0.66). ΔPASI was most strongly correlated with reductions in superficial fat (r = 0.89), DLQI (r = 0.55), and BDI (r = 0.51). Changes in BMI and glycemic markers were not significantly associated after adjustment. In patients with psoriasis and obesity, semaglutide improves both skin disease and systemic health. The clinical benefit appears associated with specific fat loss and psychosocial improvement, beyond overall weight reduction.",2025,Oct,Clinical and experimental dermatology,Joana Nicolau; Antoni Nadal; Pilar Sanchís; Antelm Pujol; María Isabel Tamayo; Guido Sfondrini; Mireia Grimalt; Paula García; Cristina Nadal; Lluís Masmiquel,1821,True,2025-10-01
41069706,The dual impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on metabolic and reproductive health in polycystic ovary syndrome: insights from human and animal trials.,"Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a prevalent disorder in the modern world, affecting around 6%-20% of females of childbearing age. Hormonal and metabolic symptoms vary over time but often arise throughout puberty. Treatment includes lifestyle interventions as a first line of treatment. In certain cases, specific medications may be considered. However, there is a growing interest in using Glucagon-like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists (GLP-1RAs) in PCOS due to their efficacy in weight loss, insulin resistance, and heart health. Aside from the metabolic role of GLP-1RAs, which aids in the relief of PCOS symptoms, there is also the possibility of direct involvement in reproductive health in PCOS, including its role in the hypothalamic-gonadal axis, menstrual irregularity, ovulation, ovarian morphology, anti-inflammatory properties, and fertility. This review discusses the latest data on GLP-1RAs' metabolic and reproductive health benefits in PCOS. Moreover, this article covers pharmaceutical interactions and synergistic effects of drugs, including metformin and other medications, with GLP-1RAs. It also conveys an overview of recent clinical trials utilizing GLP-1RAs to treat PCOS.",2025,01,Therapeutic advances in endocrinology and metabolism,Bassel H Hoteit; Jana Kotaich; Hadi Ftouni; Fatima Hazime; Abdallah Safawi; Rim Masri; Mia Marwani,1195,True,2025-01-01
41110352,Oral rhein attenuate nonalcoholic steatohepatitis in mice through the modulation of gut microbiota and Th17 cell differentiation.,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is an important clinical issue and a challenge in the field of global public health. However, there are very few clinically approved drugs that can effectively treat NASH. Rhein is a natural organic compound with anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties, but the specific role and mechanism on NASH remain unexplored. This study investigated the role and associated mechanism of rhein in NASH mice. The effects of rhein on lipid accumulation were evaluated in NASH mice through systemic signs of obesity, biochemical parameters, and histological changes. Network pharmacology was employed to determine the main bioactive compounds and key targets of rhein for the NASH treatment. Additionally, antibiotics treatment and fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) were performed to investigate the role of microbiota in the treatment of NASH with rhein. Bacterial 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing, LC-MS/MS analysis and flow cytometric were employed to investigate the mechanisms underlying rhein's regulatory effects on gut microbiota, BA metabolism and immune balance. Finally, in vitro cell experiments were conducted to explore the effects of metabolites on Th17 cell differentiation. Our results showed that mice treated with rhein showed a significant alleviating effect from high-fat diet (HFD)-induced liver lipid accumulation and pathological changes compared to those in HFD group. The protective effects of rhein are gut microbiota dependent, as demonstrated by fecal microbiome transplantation and antibiotics treatment. Microbiota transferred from rhein-treated mice displayed a similar role in attenuating hepatic lipid deposition as rhein on NASH in mice, and depletion of the gut microbiota through antibiotics treatments diminished the protective effects of rhein on NASH mice. Moreover, the results from bacterial 16S rRNA sequencing suggested that rhein partially attenuated HFD-induced gut dysbiosis in NASH mice. Network pharmacology analyses was implemented and showed that Th17 cell differentiation might be the potential target in the treatment of rhein against NASH, which was confirmed by flow cytometric analysis showing markedly decrease of the percentage of Th17 cells, corresponded with upregulated Treg cells in rhein-treated NASH mice. Furthermore, targeted bile acid metabolomics analysis showed that supplement with rhein greatly increased the levels of primary bile acids β-MCA and AlloLCA, positively correlated with the relative abundances of Bifidobacterium_choerinum, which may play the key role by which rhein-altered gut microbiota promoted the restoration of Th17/Treg balance in NASH mice. Subsequent in vitro experiments confirmed that AlloLCA directly inhibits Th17 cell differentiation, with suppression of glycolysis potentially serving as the underlying mechanism for the immunomodulatory effects of AlloLCA. Collectively, our results suggested that orally administrated rhein reduced hepatic lipid deposition through the modulation of dysregulated gut microbiota and bile acids metabolism, thus regulating Th17/Treg immune balance. This study uncovers a novel mechanistic axis in NASH pathogenesis and providing new research directions for microbiota-targeted clinical strategies.",2025,Oct,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,Yali Yuan; Jiayan Hu; Xinyu Lu; Haixiao Han; Muyuan Wang; Wenji Zhang; Yao Jiao; Yitong Li; Zhengdao Lin; Chengtao Liang; Yitong Yu; Chune Xie; Junxiang Li; Tangyou Mao,3262,True,2025-10-01
41094012,Predicting carotid plaques in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease using machine learning and SHAP interpretation.,"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the most common cause of death worldwide. Carotid plaque is an indicator of subclinical CVDs. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a risk factor for atherosclerotic CVDs. We aimed to develop and validate a predictive model for carotid plaque occurrence in annual health check-up populations, to integrate health check-up indicators with machine learning (ML) algorithms and LASSO-based feature selection and leverage advanced interpretability frameworks to elucidate the contribution of individual risk factors. In this retrospective cohort study, we enrolled 4,973 MASLD patients, among whom 1,178 were diagnosed with carotid plaques using carotid ultrasound. Collected baseline data included ​demographic indicators, ​clinical histories, blood ​biochemical parameters, and liver function test indicators. A predictive model for carotid plaques was developed and validated using five ML algorithms. Model performance was evaluated based on the​ area under the curve, ​sensitivity, ​specificity, ​accuracy, and ​F1 Score. For model interpretability, we adopted the ​Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) framework to quantify the contribution of individual features to the prediction outcomes. Among the five ML algorithm models, the support vectors machine model demonstrated superior discriminative capability, higher goodness-of-fit, and greater clinical utility compared to other ML algorithm models. Moreover, age, systolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, sex, and fasting plasma glucose were the most important risk factors associated with carotid plaques in the MASLD population. This study demonstrated the feasibility of constructing a predictive model for carotid plaques in MASLD populations using health check-up indicators combined with ML algorithms. The application of SHAP methods enhanced model interpretability by quantifying the contribution of individual risk factors to prediction outcomes, enabling clinicians to identify high risk MASLD patients prone to carotid plaque development, so that they can adjust interventions accordingly.",2025,Oct,Scientific reports,Shu-Mei Zhai; Xiao-Long Wang; Han Zhang; Yu-Qiang Zuo,2127,True,2025-10-01
41101053,Water level forecasting in coastal cities using a hybrid deep learning approach.,"Accurate and real time flood prediction in coastal cities remains challenging due to the nonlinear and dynamic nature of the hydrological processes, coupled with limitations in long-term historical data availability. This study introduced a hybrid deep learning model, CNN-Transformer-SKANs, that combines convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Transformer layers, and Swallow Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (SKANs) to forecast the hourly water level in Venice, Italy. The model is trained on two years of high resolution meteorological and hydrological data, including variables such as wind speed, tide level, humidity, atmospheric pressure and prior water level. Comparative results with baseline models such as LSTM, CNN-LSTM, Transformer and their KANs enhanced variants demonstrate that proposed CNN-Transformer-SKANs achieves superior accuracy (Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency, NSE ≈ 0.99; Root Mean Square Error, RMSE <0.03 m) and robustness even under reduced training data scenarios and synthetic extreme value simulations, achieving RMSE as low as 0.02-0.03 m and NSE up to 0.99, outperforming traditional LSTM and CNN-LSTM baselines (RMSE 0.04-0.07 m; NSE 0.90-0.97).

41004212,Patterns and costs associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist use in US adults with type 2 diabetes.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) offer cardiorenal benefits in diabetes management. Since 2020, public awareness of GLP-1 RAs for diabetes, weight loss, and the prevention of cardiovascular disease has led to a surge in their utilization. However, the high cost of GLP-1 RAs and limitations in insurance coverage have been considered significant barriers to access. Current knowledge regarding how GLP-1 RA use affects total health care costs in diabetes care after 2020 in the United States remains limited. Consequently, further research is needed to examine the financial burden of GLP-1 RA use on patients and payers, as well as its overall impact on total health care costs at the national level. To examine GLP-1 RA utilization and association with health care costs among US adults with type 2 diabetes. Using data from the 2021-2022 Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, the study sample included individuals (aged ≥18 years) with a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. Outcomes included GLP-1 RA use and all-cause and diabetes-related health care costs, including medical and prescription drug costs paid by patients and insurers. Generalized linear regression with a log link and gamma distribution was used to assess the effect of GLP-1 RA use on health care costs, adjusting for sociodemographic and health-related characteristics. Among 3,587 eligible adults with type 2 diabetes, 637 (18.8%) used GLP-1 RAs, representing an estimated 3.66 million US adults-a marked increase compared with pre-2020 estimates of less than 10%. Fewer older adults (aged ≥65 years) used GLP-1 RAs (35.1%) compared with adults aged 45-64 years (50.6%). The average annual per-person cost of GLP-1 RA was $6,947. Although insurance covered more than 95% of GLP-1 RA cost, these medications represented a substantial proportion of diabetes care costs: 63.3% of antidiabetic drug costs and 55.7% of total diabetes-related costs among GLP-1 RA users. After adjustment, GLP-1 RA use was associated with a 219% increase in diabetes-related costs and a 55.3% increase in total all-cause health care costs. GLP-1 RA utilization among US adults with type 2 diabetes has substantially increased, with use in 2021-2022 nearly double that of the period prior to 2020. The higher health care costs associated with taking GLP-1 RAs were largely attributable to high drug costs, of which over 95% were covered by insurance.",2025,Oct,Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy,Jun Wu; Alexandra Perez; Patrick W Sullivan,2412,True,2025-10-01
41109836,Impact of glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonist therapy on pulmonary function in people with cystic fibrosis who achieve normal body mass index.,"Glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide/glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GIP/GLP-1 RA) are being explored for use in people with CF (pwCF) and CF-related diabetes. In pwCF who are overweight or obese, GLP-1 RA and GIP/GLP-1 RA may offer additional benefits beyond glycemic control, including potential benefits in lung function. However, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the impact of these medications on pulmonary function in pwCF and whether the associated weight loss adversely affects lung function. This study is the first to describe the impact of GLP-1 RA and GIP/GLP-1 RA on lung function in pwCF who experienced weight loss and had a normal-range body mass index (BMI) of 18.5-24.9 kg/m Subjects experienced 11.1 kg median weight loss (-15.5 % median weight reduction); median BMI reduced from 26.2 kg/m Future multi-center studies are needed to investigate the efficacy and tolerability of GLP-1 RA therapy in pwCF.

41058092,Chlorogenic Acid Alleviates Non-Alcoholic Steatohepatitis via Suppressing Liver Inflammatory Injury by Targeting Transforming Growth Factor Beta Receptor-1 in Liver Sinusoidal Endothelial Cells.,"Increasing evidence indicates that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) are crucial for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) development. Based on chlorogenic acid (CGA), which can improve NASH, this study aims to investigate the concrete mechanism of LSECs in NASH progression and identify CGA's key target in LSECs. High-fat diet and methionine and choline deficient diet were used to induce NASH in mice. Western blot detecting endothelial molecules' expression, leukostasis assay, and Evans blue leakage were conducted to observe hepatic endothelial barrier dysfunction. Cell adhesion, transendothelial migration (TEM), and transendothelial electrical resistance were performed. Biotin pull-down, cellular thermal shift assay, and surface plasmon resonance were used to identify CGA's key target. The pivotal roles of TGFβR1 and ID1 were investigated using adeno-associated virus, plasmid, siRNA, or chemical inhibitor. CGA decreased ID1 expression by binding to TGFβR1 in LSECs, thereby reversing the change of hepatic vascular phenotype and abrogating hepatic infiltration of inflammatory cells during NASH progression. ID1 knockdown alleviated liver inflammation via suppressing TEM of inflammatory cells through reversing endothelial barrier dysfunction. However, TGFβR1 or ID1 overexpression reversed the CGA-provided amelioration of liver inflammatory injury and endothelial barrier disorder. The decreased ID1 reduced NFκB-initiated VCAM1 and ICAM1 expression and weakened ID1's inhibition on HIF1α-mediated VE-Cad expression, thereby maintaining hepatic endothelium homeostasis. LSECs are crucial for the progression of liver steatosis into NASH, and CGA alleviated liver inflammatory injury during NASH progression by inhibiting ID1-initiated NFκB and HIF1α signaling pathways through binding to TGFβR1 in LSECs.",2025,Oct,Phytotherapy research : PTR,Hao Ouyang; Hui Miao; Hong Zhang; Bin Lu; Jinyu Zhang; Tianyu Zhang; Junfeng Zhu; Zhengtao Wang; Lili Ji,1832,True,2025-10-01

Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA), a systematic search was performed in PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane Library for GLP-1 RA RCTs that evaluated pancreatitis/pancreatic cancer. A meta-analysis was conducted to evaluate this risk; subgroup analysis was performed with and without background medications. 62 studies utilising dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, semaglutide, beinaglutide, retatrutide, or tirzepatide, with 66,232 patients, mean age of 58.3 years (14.4 to 68), and mean follow-up of 43.5 weeks (1 to 198) were included in this study. Meta-analysis showed a significantly increased risk of pancreatitis (RR: 1.44, 95% CI 1.09-1.89, p = 0.009), but not when stratified by background medications (RR: 1.28, 95% CI 0.87-1.87) and without background medications (RR: 1.37, 95% CI 0.91-2.05). Pancreatic cancer and GLP-1 RA use showed no significant association (RR: 1.30, 95% CI 0.86-1.97). However, a significant increase was found with background medications (RR: 1.85, 95% CI 1.05-3.26, p = 0.03), but not without (RR: 0.81, 95% CI 0.43-1.55). GLP-1 RAs carry a slightly increased risk of pancreatitis, which is not significant when stratified by background medication use.

38782182,Obesity and MASLD: Is weight loss the (only) key to treat metabolic liver disease?,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) closely associates with obesity and type 2 diabetes. Lifestyle intervention and bariatric surgery aiming at substantial weight loss are cornerstones of MASLD treatment by improving histological outcomes and reducing risks of comorbidities. Originally developed as antihyperglycemic drugs, incretin (co-)agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors also reduce steatosis and cardiorenovascular events. Certain incretin agonists effectively improve histological features of MASLD, but not fibrosis. Of note, beneficial effects on MASLD may not necessarily require weight loss. Despite moderate weight gain, one PPARγ agonist improved adipose tissue and MASLD with certain benefit on fibrosis in post-hoc analyses. Likewise, the first THRβ-agonist was recently provisionally approved because of significant improvements of MASLD and fibrosis. We here discuss liver-related and metabolic effects induced by different MASLD treatments and their association with weight loss. Therefore, we compare results from clinical trials on drugs acting via weight loss (incretin (co)agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors) with those exerting no weight loss (pioglitazone; resmetirom). Furthermore, other drugs in development directly targeting hepatic lipid metabolism (lipogenesis inhibitors, FGF21 analogs) are addressed. Although THRβ-agonism may effectively improve hepatic outcomes, MASLD treatment concepts should consider all cardiometabolic risk factors for effective reduction of morbidity and mortality in the affected people.",2024,Aug,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,Maximilian Huttasch; Michael Roden; Sabine Kahl,1560,True,2024-08-01

This analysis compares the evaluation of histological features of NASH between pathologists and a machine-learning (ML) pathology model. This post hoc analysis included data from a subset of patients (n=251) with biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis stage F1-F3 from a 72-week randomized placebo-controlled trial of once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide 0.1, 0.2, or 0.4 mg (NCT02970942). Biopsies at baseline and week 72 were read by 2 pathologists. Digitized biopsy slides were evaluated by PathAI's NASH ML models to quantify changes in fibrosis, steatosis, inflammation, and hepatocyte ballooning using categorical assessments and continuous scores. Pathologist and ML-derived categorical assessments detected a significantly greater percentage of patients achieving the primary endpoint of NASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis with semaglutide 0.4 mg versus placebo (pathologist 58.5% vs. 22.0%, p < 0.0001; ML 36.9% vs. 11.9%; p =0.0015). Both methods detected a higher but nonsignificant percentage of patients on semaglutide 0.4 mg versus placebo achieving the secondary endpoint of liver fibrosis improvement without NASH worsening. ML continuous scores detected significant treatment-induced responses in histological features, including a quantitative reduction in fibrosis with semaglutide 0.4 mg versus placebo ( p =0.0099) that could not be detected using pathologist or ML categorical assessment.

While these medications promote weight reduction, they may predispose patients to nutritional deficiencies. This study aims to evaluate the preoperative nutritional status of GLP-1 users undergoing TJA compared to nonusers. A retrospective chart review was conducted at a high-volume center on patients who underwent elective primary TJA between January 1 and May 1, 2025.

41109558,Enhanced macromolecule bioavailability in rats and pigs using an in situ forming synthetic epithelial lining.,"Oral delivery of macromolecules is hindered by enzymatic degradation, poor epithelial permeability, and rapid gastric transit, leading to low bioavailability. Existing permeation enhancers (PEs), such as salcaprozate sodium and sodium caprate, improve absorption but do not fully address proteolytic degradation and require high doses due in part to short gastrointestinal residence times. We developed the Peroral Mucosal Epithelium Absorption Enhancer (PERMEATE) system, an orally administered polymer film designed to adhere to the small intestinal mucosa, maximizing contact between therapeutics, PEs, and the absorptive tissue. Utilizing Synthetic Tissue-Lining (SYNT™) technology, PERMEATE triggers endogenous catalase-dependent dopamine polymerization to form an in situ polydopamine coating, creating a temporary depot that enhances co-localization and prolongs exposure to the absorptive mucosa. We assessed PERMEATE's potential to enhance the oral bioavailability of semaglutide (SEMA). High-throughput screening using the GI tissue robotic interface system (GI-ORIS) identified glycocholic acid (GCA) and ammonium carbonate (NHCO) as effective PEs when combined with SYNT. Ex vivo studies (n = 8-24) and in vivo tests in Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 5-11/group) demonstrated a 200-fold increase in bioavailability compared to SEMA alone (P = 0.0001) and a 6-fold increase relative to SEMA+PE without SYNT (P = 0.0011).

41065944,The ethics of Wegovy: promoting autonomy in pediatric care.,"Semaglutide, marketed as Wegovy, Ozempic, and Rybelsus, is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) that has attracted significant global attention for its appetite-suppressing and weight-loss effects. Approved for pediatric use in children aged 12 and older, Wegovy has been described as a ""miracle drug"" and hailed as a potential solution to the so-called ""obesity epidemic."" However, prescribing medication to children raises complex ethical questions, including how best to respect young patients' autonomy and promote their well-being. This paper focuses on one such concern: the ""argument from virtue."" According to this view, Wegovy represents a morally problematic approach to weight loss because it circumvents the development of character traits-such as self-control and resilience-that are seen as integral to autonomy. We critically examine this argument, rejecting the claim that there is a single morally ""right way"" to lose weight, and argue that Wegovy, when prescribed within a supportive framework, may help children build and exercise autonomy. We review the drug's function and efficacy, analyze how it might promote or hinder autonomy, and offer recommendations to support ethical prescribing practices that align with respect for children's agency.",2025,Oct,"Medicine, health care, and philosophy",Nanette Ryan; Julian Savulescu,1284,True,2025-10-01

This study randomly assigned 315 patients starting GLP-1RA therapy into a control group (CG, standard treatment + routine care), a placebo group (PG, placebo + routine care), and a traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) group (TG, TCM plaster therapy + routine care). The glycemic control, pancreatic function, hematological parameters, renal function, and adverse reactions (ARs) were compared among the groups. The TG exhibited no significant differences in fasting blood glucose (FBG), postprandial blood glucose at two hours, glycated hemoglobin (Hb), fasting insulin (FINS) levels, b-cell insulin secretion, and insulin resistance (IR) when compared to the CG and the PG (P>0.05). Additionally, there were no significant changes in Hb, white blood cell (WBC) count, and erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) in the TG relative to the CG and PG (P>0.05). Renal function indicators revealed that the levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) and serum creatinine (Cr) in the TG did not differ significantly from those in the CG and the PG (P>0.05). The incidence of ARs in TG (8.57%) was markedly lower than in PG (17.14%) and CG (18.1%) (P<0.05). The application of TCM Liangfu Pills via acupoint plaster did not demonstrate significant therapeutic effects on glycemic control, pancreatic function, or routine blood parameters. However, it was effective in significantly reducing the risk of gastrointestinal adverse reactions associated with GLP-1RA therapy.

38186863,Potential therapeutic targets for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: Glucagon-like peptide 1.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most rapidly growing contributor to liver mortality and morbidity. Hepatocellular injury in nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is caused by an increase in metabolic substrates (glucose, fructose, and fatty acids), leading fatty acids to participate in pathways that cause cellular injury and a poor response to injury. The pathogenesis of this disease is largely associated with obesity, type 2 diabetes, and increasing age. To date, there are no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for NAFLD/NASH or its associated fibrosis. Since one of the pathogenic drivers of NASH is insulin re-sistance, therapies approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes are being evaluated in patients with NASH. Currently, the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) semaglutide is a safe, well-studied therapeutic for NAFLD/ NASH patients. Existing research demonstrates that semaglutide can increase the resolution of NASH but not improve fibrosis. However, improving the fibrosis of NAFLD is the only way to improve the long-term prognosis of NAFLD. Given the complex pathophysiology of NASH, combining therapies with complementary mechanisms may be beneficial. Researchers have conducted trials of semaglutide in combination with antifibrotic drugs. However, the results have not fully met expectations, and it cannot be ruled out that the reason is the short trial time. We should continue to pay increasing attention to GLP-1RAs.",2023,Dec,World journal of gastroenterology,Yue-Hua Yin; Li-Xuan Sang; Bing Chang,1490,True,2023-12-01
41072282,Schaftoside ameliorates MCD diet-induced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis via modulating immune microenvironment.,"Schaftoside (SS), a bioactive natural flavonoid di-C-glycoside derived from some famous Chinese herbs including Scutellaria baicalensis, Glycyrrhiza uralensis and Abrus mollis, has been reported to mitigate hepatic lipid accumulation and enhance liver health. This study aimed to assess the effects of SS on non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to investigate the potential mechanisms. A methionine-choline deficiency (MCD)-induced model of NASH was established. The efficacy of SS in intervening NASH was evaluated through assessments of blood lipids, liver function, and pathological conditions. Transcriptomic analysis was conducted to predict potential pathways of SS intervention in NASH, and the prediction results were validated by testing biochemical parameters, real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR), ELISA assays, and immunohistochemistry. Our results revealed that SS markedly ameliorated liver dysfunction and lipid metabolism disorders, as indicated by decreased serum concentrations of ALT and AST, along with lower liver levels of TG and TC. Based on RNA-sequencing results, we found that the expression of genes associated with inflammatory processes and fibrotic responses, including Ccl2, Cxcl2, Col1a1, Col3a1, Mmp13, Itgax, Itgam, and Acta2, were reduced following intervention with SS. In conjunction with the immune cell infiltration analysis and qPCR, we determined that SS significantly restored the disrupted immune microenvironment via regulating the functional properties of various immunocyte, particularly the modulation of genes expression related to macrophages (Cd80, Cd86, Cd204, MCP-1, Cd206, Il10, Arg1 and Tgfb1) and dendritic cells (Itgax/Cd11c, Itgam/Cd11b, MMP8, MMP9, MMP13, and TNF-α). In summary, our study provides the first evidence that SS exerts anti-NASH effects by orchestrating immune cell functions, particularly through macrophage polarization and dendritic cell modulation, thereby rectifying the dysregulated immune microenvironment. These findings position SS as a promising candidate for novel NASH therapies.",2025,Oct,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,Gui-Xuan Lin; Min-Yi Li; Ting-Ting Duan; Tao Xia; Meng-Qiu Li; Lan-Qing Meng; Zi-Yang Lin; Min-Hua Li; Ying Lai; Bai-En Liang; Ying Du; Jun-Zheng Yang; Dan Tang,2065,True,2025-10-01

As the first liver-directed pharmacological therapy option for MASLD, resmetirom offers a novel approach that specifically targets liver pathology, marking a transformative step forward in managing this widespread and challenging condition. For initiating therapy with resmetirom, a liver biopsy is not required. Consequently, accurately excluding patients with less severe liver histology or cirrhosis using noninvasive tests (NITs) is essential. In addition, monitoring the therapy response should be conducted using NITs. Given the recent approval, our current clinical understanding of resmetirom is primarily informed by phase 3 clinical trials. The long-term effects of the drug should be evaluated in further studies by encouraging the use of the drug in eligible patients.

36468565,Side effect profile of pharmacologic therapies for liver fibrosis in nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.,"Several studies have found that antifibrosis treatment for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) can cause a variety of side effects. No network meta-analysis (NMA) analyzes the adverse events of antifibrotic drugs for NAFLD. This NMA aimed to systematically compare the drug-related side effects when using different pharmacological agents for the treatment of liver fibrosis in NAFLD. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane Library were systematically searched to select related studies published in English from the database inception until 30 June 2022. We conducted Bayesian fixed-effects NMA using data from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to derive relative risks (RRs). The surface under the cumulative ranking (SUCRA) probabilities was used to assess ranking. A total of 26 RCTs with 19 interventions met the inclusion criteria. SUCRA analysis suggested that the lanifibranor group had the highest risk of diarrhea (SUCRA, 94), whereas the liraglutide group had the highest risk of constipation (SUCRA, 92.9). The semaglutide group showed the highest incidence of nausea (SUCRA, 81.2) and abdominal pain (SUCRA, 90.5), respectively. The cenicriviroc group showed the highest risk in the incidence of fatigue (SUCRA, 82.4). The MSDC-0602K group had the highest risk of headache (SUCRA, 76.4), whereas the obeticholic acid group had the highest risk of pruritus (SUCRA, 80.1). The risk of side effects significantly varied among different pharmacologic regimens, and evidence showed that lanifibranor, liraglutide, semaglutide, cenicriviroc, MSDC-0602K and obeticholic acid were the pharmacological interventions with the highest risk in patients with NAFLD.

41092926,"Burden of 375 diseases and injuries, risk-attributable burden of 88 risk factors, and healthy life expectancy in 204 countries and territories, including 660 subnational locations, 1990-2023: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2023.","For more than three decades, the Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study (GBD) has provided a framework to quantify health loss due to diseases, injuries, and associated risk factors. This paper presents GBD 2023 findings on disease and injury burden and risk-attributable health loss, offering a global audit of the state of world health to inform public health priorities. This work captures the evolving landscape of health metrics across age groups, sexes, and locations, while reflecting on the remaining post-COVID-19 challenges to achieving our collective global health ambitions. The GBD 2023 combined analysis estimated years lived with disability (YLDs), years of life lost (YLLs), and disability-adjusted life-years (DALYs) for 375 diseases and injuries, and risk-attributable burden associated with 88 modifiable risk factors. Of the more than 310 000 total data sources used for all GBD 2023 (about 30% of which were new to this estimation round), more than 120 000 sources were used for estimation of disease and injury burden and 59 000 for risk factor estimation, and included vital registration systems, surveys, disease registries, and published scientific literature. Data were analysed using previously established modelling approaches, such as disease modelling meta-regression version 2.1 (DisMod-MR 2.1) and comparative risk assessment methods. Diseases and injuries were categorised into four levels on the basis of the established GBD cause hierarchy, as were risk factors using the GBD risk hierarchy. Estimates stratified by age, sex, location, and year from 1990 to 2023 were focused on disease-specific time trends over the 2010-23 period and presented as counts (to three significant figures) and age-standardised rates per 100 000 person-years (to one decimal place). For each measure, 95% uncertainty intervals [UIs] were calculated with the 2·5th and 97·5th percentile ordered values from a 250-draw distribution. Total numbers of global DALYs grew 6·1% (95% UI 4·0-8·1), from 2·64 billion (2·46-2·86) in 2010 to 2·80 billion (2·57-3·08) in 2023, but age-standardised DALY rates, which account for population growth and ageing, decreased by 12·6% (11·0-14·1), revealing large long-term health improvements. Non-communicable diseases (NCDs) contributed 1·45 billion (1·31-1·61) global DALYs in 2010, increasing to 1·80 billion (1·63-2·03) in 2023, alongside a concurrent 4·1% (1·9-6·3) reduction in age-standardised rates. Based on DALY counts, the leading level 3 NCDs in 2023 were ischaemic heart disease (193 million [176-209] DALYs), stroke (157 million [141-172]), and diabetes (90·2 million [75·2-107]), with the largest increases in age-standardised rates since 2010 occurring for anxiety disorders (62·8% [34·0-107·5]), depressive disorders (26·3% [11·6-42·9]), and diabetes (14·9% [7·5-25·6]). Remarkable health gains were made for communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional (CMNN) diseases, with DALYs falling from 874 million (837-917) in 2010 to 681 million (642-736) in 2023, and a 25·8% (22·6-28·7) reduction in age-standardised DALY rates. During the COVID-19 pandemic, DALYs due to CMNN diseases rose but returned to pre-pandemic levels by 2023. From 2010 to 2023, decreases in age-standardised rates for CMNN diseases were led by rate decreases of 49·1% (32·7-61·0) for diarrhoeal diseases, 42·9% (38·0-48·0) for HIV/AIDS, and 42·2% (23·6-56·6) for tuberculosis. Neonatal disorders and lower respiratory infections remained the leading level 3 CMNN causes globally in 2023, although both showed notable rate decreases from 2010, declining by 16·5% (10·6-22·0) and 24·8% (7·4-36·7), respectively. Injury-related age-standardised DALY rates decreased by 15·6% (10·7-19·8) over the same period. Differences in burden due to NCDs, CMNN diseases, and injuries persisted across age, sex, time, and location. Based on our risk analysis, nearly 50% (1·27 billion [1·18-1·38]) of the roughly 2·80 billion total global DALYs in 2023 were attributable to the 88 risk factors analysed in GBD. Globally, the five level 3 risk factors contributing the highest proportion of risk-attributable DALYs were high systolic blood pressure (SBP), particulate matter pollution, high fasting plasma glucose (FPG), smoking, and low birthweight and short gestation-with high SBP accounting for 8·4% (6·9-10·0) of total DALYs. Of the three overarching level 1 GBD risk factor categories-behavioural, metabolic, and environmental and occupational-risk-attributable DALYs rose between 2010 and 2023 only for metabolic risks, increasing by 30·7% (24·8-37·3); however, age-standardised DALY rates attributable to metabolic risks decreased by 6·7% (2·0-11·0) over the same period. For all but three of the 25 leading level 3 risk factors, age-standardised rates dropped between 2010 and 2023-eg, declining by 54·4% (38·7-65·3) for unsafe sanitation, 50·5% (33·3-63·1) for unsafe water source, and 45·2% (25·6-72·0) for no access to handwashing facility, and by 44·9% (37·3-53·5) for child growth failure. The three leading level 3 risk factors for which age-standardised attributable DALY rates rose were high BMI (10·5% [0·1 to 20·9]), drug use (8·4% [2·6 to 15·3]), and high FPG (6·2% [-2·7 to 15·6]; non-significant). Our findings underscore the complex and dynamic nature of global health challenges. Since 2010, there have been large decreases in burden due to CMNN diseases and many environmental and behavioural risk factors, juxtaposed with sizeable increases in DALYs attributable to metabolic risk factors and NCDs in growing and ageing populations. This long-observed consequence of the global epidemiological transition was only temporarily interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The substantially decreasing CMNN disease burden, despite the 2008 global financial crisis and pandemic-related disruptions, is one of the greatest collective public health successes known. However, these achievements are at risk of being reversed due to major cuts to development assistance for health globally, the effects of which will hit low-income countries with high burden the hardest. Without sustained investment in evidence-based interventions and policies, progress could stall or reverse, leading to widespread human costs and geopolitical instability. Moreover, the rising NCD burden necessitates intensified efforts to mitigate exposure to leading risk factors-eg, air pollution, smoking, and metabolic risks, such as high SBP, BMI, and FPG-including policies that promote food security, healthier diets, physical activity, and equitable and expanded access to potential treatments, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists. Decisive, coordinated action is needed to address long-standing yet growing health challenges, including depressive and anxiety disorders. Yet this can be only part of the solution. Our response to the NCD syndemic-the complex interaction of multiple health risks, social determinants, and systemic challenges-will define the future landscape of global health. To ensure human wellbeing, economic stability, and social equity, global action to sustain and advance health gains must prioritise reducing disparities by addressing socioeconomic and demographic determinants, ensuring equitable health-care access, tackling malnutrition, strengthening health systems, and improving vaccination coverage.

This meta-analysis assesses their effectiveness in quantifying liver fat and grading steatosis. Scopus, Web of Science, and MEDLINE (PubMed) were systematically searched up to February 20, 2024. Eligible studies included original research in English, focusing on MRI-based assessments of hepatic steatosis in humans with no comorbidities, with magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) or pathology as the reference standard. Fat fraction and steatosis grade were evaluated using correlation, mean difference, and diagnostic accuracy metrics. This review was registered with PROSPERO with registration number CRD42024524991. Out of 9852 unique studies, 18 were included. Selective saturation fat fraction demonstrated the strongest Fisher's Z-transformed correlation with the reference standard (0.93), followed by proton density fat fraction (PDFF) (0.9). PDFF exhibited the highest Fisher's Z-transformed correlation with hepatic steatosis grading of the reference standard (0.67) and the highest AUROC for diagnosing hepatic steatosis (0.99). Magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) and MRI-PDFF multiparametric MRI showed the greatest sensitivity (0.97) for hepatic steatosis diagnosis, while multiecho gradient echo (MEGE) demonstrated the highest specificity (0.99). The analysis revealed moderate to strong correlations between MRI and reference standard FF, with MRI-PDFF demonstrating the highest diagnostic accuracy. There was significant variability in results across studies due to differences in techniques, field strength, and study design.

41103369,GLP-1 selectively enhances tonic GABA,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a metabolic hormone secreted by L-cells in the gut and it stimulates insulin secretion in the pancreatic islets by activating GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1Rs). In the brain, the GLP-1Rs are expressed in many regions including the hippocampus. We examined whether GLP-1 modulation of GABA-activated currents in the mouse hippocampus varied along the hippocampal dorsal-ventral axis. We recorded spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic (sIPSCs) and tonic extrasynaptic currents in dorsal and ventral hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) granule cells in brain slices from 2-month-old mice. GLP-1 (100 pM) did not modulate the GABA-activated fast or slow phasic postsynaptic currents in either the dorsal or the ventral hippocampal slices. In contrast, the tonic extrasynaptic current was potentiated by GLP-1 but, only consistently in the DG granule cells of the ventral hippocampus. Thus, GLP-1 modulation of the DG neurons depends on the dorso-ventral longitudinal hippocampal axis and further, with the subcellular location (synaptic vs. extrasynaptic) of the GABA",2025,01,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,Olga Netsyk; Sergiy V Korol; Bryndis Birnir; Zhe Jin,1084,True,2025-01-01

Lifestyle intervention remains a preferred treatment modality for NAFLD. The glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors have been developed as new glucose-lowering drugs, which can improve fatty liver via an insulin-independent glucose-lowering effect. However, studies exploring the efficacy of GLP-1 receptor agonists combined with SGLT-2 inhibitors in patients with NAFLD and T2DM are scanty. Thus, the present randomised controlled trial aims at comparing the efficacy and safety of semaglutide plus empagliflozin with each treatment alone in patients with NAFLD and T2DM. This 52-week double-blinded, randomised, parallel-group, active-controlled trial evaluates the effects of semaglutide, empagliflozin and semaglutide + empagliflozin in 105 eligible overweight/obese subjects with NAFLD and T2DM. The primary outcome will be a change from baseline to week 52 in the controlled attenuation parameter, free fatty acid and glucagon. Secondary endpoints include changes in liver stiffness measurement, liver enzymes, blood glucose, lipid levels, renal function, electrolyte balances, minerals and bone metabolism, cytokines, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, ferritin, anthropometric indicators, nonalcoholic fatty liver fibrosis score, fibrosis 4 score and homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance. In addition, intention-to-treat, interim analysis and safety analysis will be performed. This double-blinded, randomised, clinical trial involves a multi-disciplinary approach and aims to explore the synergistic effects of the combination of semaglutide and empagliflozin.

41093942,PARIS/ZNF746 DNA-binding domain deficiency promotes adipose tissue hyperplasia and hepatic lipid accumulation.,"Zinc finger protein 746 (ZNF746), also known as PARKIN-interacting substrate (PARIS), is a KRAB-ZFP family transcriptional repressor implicated in Parkinson's disease and adipogenesis. Its unclear role in systemic metabolism led us to investigate PARIS-mediated metabolic function by generating mice with a knockout of Znf746 exon 7 (P7KO), containing the DNA-binding domain. Under a high-fat diet, P7KO mice exhibited larger gains in body and adipose tissue weight alongside improved insulin sensitivity and reduced adipocyte size compared with wild-type mice, suggesting hyperplastic expansion of white adipose tissue. P7KO mice also showed elevated anti-inflammatory markers in adipose tissues, in contrast to accumulation of lipids and upregulation of lipogenic genes, without changes in glucose transporter or lipid uptake genes, in the liver. These findings indicate a dual role for PARIS: suppressing adipose hyperplasia and restricting hepatic lipogenesis. Identification of the evolutionary conservation of PARIS among mammals, particularly the shared DNA-binding domain between mice and humans, support its translational relevance. Collectively, our results identify PARIS as a previously unrecognized regulator of metabolic homeostasis that coordinates lipid storage and utilization in a tissue-specific manner. Targeting PARIS may offer a novel therapeutic strategy for obesity-related metabolic disorders, such as type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease.",2025,Oct,Scientific reports,Kazuki Hachiya; Yuhei Mizunoe; Joo-Joo Yang; Yuki Uchida; Hiroto Fukai; Tatsuhiro Esashi; Yuka Nozaki; Seiya Mizuno; Satoru Takahashi; Masaki Kobayashi; Yoshikazu Higami,1482,True,2025-10-01
41169457,Identification and Validation of Lipid Metabolism-Related Biomarkers GPD1 and CEBPD in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) remains a major clinical challenge due to the lack of effective diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets. Identifying and validating key lipid metabolism-related genes may offer novel strategies for the early diagnosis and targeted treatment of MASH. In this study, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified from public databases using integrated bioinformatics approaches. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and multiple machine learning algorithms were employed to screen for hub genes closely associated with MASH. The expression levels and diagnostic potential of the candidate genes GPD1 and CEBPD were systematically evaluated through nomogram construction, immune infiltration analysis, and both in vivo and in vitro experiments. Their biological functions were further validated at the cellular level. The results revealed a strong association between lipid metabolism dysregulation and alterations in immune cell composition in MASH. GPD1 was significantly upregulated and CEBPD was downregulated in both the MASH animal and cell models, and both genes showed good diagnostic value. Functional experiments demonstrated that knockdown of GPD1 in HepG2 cells significantly reduced lipid accumulation, inflammatory responses, and expression of fibrosis-related markers. Similarly, overexpression of CEBPD also inhibited these pathological processes, indicating that both GPD1 and CEBPD play critical roles in MASH progression. This study highlights the importance of GPD1 and CEBPD as potential diagnostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets for MASH, providing a theoretical and experimental foundation for improving early diagnostic strategies and developing interventions targeting inflammation and lipid metabolism dysregulation in metabolic liver disease.",2025,01,Journal of inflammation research,Jianyu Zhou; Chunying Xiao; Bin Huang; Fenfang Chen,1857,True,2025-01-01

40066918,A Markov Model Unveiling the Impact of Resmetirom on the Natural History of MASLD Patients: A Sistematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"The MAESTRO-NASH phase 3 trial reported that a 52-week treatment of Resmetirom is effective in improving fibrosis and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) in patients with MASH and F2 or F3 fibrosis, while data on the impact on 5-year and long-term clinical outcomes are still lacking. We simulated the transition probabilities of disease progression in MASLD patients with F2 or F3 fibrosis and the effect of Resmetirom treatment on clinical outcomes. A meta-analysis of literature data formed transition matrices for fibrosis stages and complications, defined as compensated (CC) and decompensated cirrhosis (DC), hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and mortality-liver-related mortality (LR-M), cardiovascular mortality (CV-M) and extra-hepatic cancer mortality (EHC-M). Markov model was developed to depict the F2 and F3 fibrosis stage progression towards the complications and to evaluate the effect of Resmetirom treatment on the natural history of MASLD. We estimated the 5-year probability of Resmetirom-treated and untreated MASLD patients with baseline F2 fibrosis of developing CC (5.16% vs. 6.82%, respectively), DC (0.25% vs. 0.3%, respectively), HCC (0.25% vs. 0.32%, respectively) and mortality (0.15% vs. 0.16% for LR-M; 1.02% vs. 1.1% for CV-M; 1.07% vs. 1.2% for EHC-M, respectively). Similarly, we estimated the five-year probability of Resmetirom-treated and untreated MASLD patients with baseline F3 fibrosis of developing CC (17.12% vs. 21.34%, respectively), DC(1.1% vs. 1.47%, respectively), HCC (1.21% vs. 1.73%, respectively) and mortality (0.59% vs. 0.91% for LR-M, 1.92% vs. 2.14% for CV-M and 1.04% vs. 1.14% for EHC-M, respectively). Life Years Gained (LYG) of Resmetirom-treated patients were 0.45 and 0.63 in MASLD patients with F2 and F3 fibrosis, respectively, and the model was sensitive to changes in Resmetirom efficacy and transition probabilities.

41156123,Advancing Heart Failure Care: Breakthroughs and Emerging Strategies.,"Heart failure represents a complex clinical syndrome characterized by progressive ventricular dysfunction, systemic congestion, and high mortality despite significant advances in pharmacological and device-based therapy. This review explores recent developments across the heart failure continuum, with a focus on therapeutic advances across the continuum of care, with emphasis on both established and emerging strategies. In patients with reduced ejection fraction, early initiation of the four pillars markedly lowers cardiovascular events, yet real-world implementation remains limited by therapeutic inertia and underdosing. Novel agents such as finerenone provide cardiorenal benefits in patients with diabetes and chronic kidney disease, while glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists show promise in preserved or mildly reduced ejection fraction, particularly with obesity. Tricuspid regurgitation, once considered a secondary phenomenon, is now recognized as a modifiable contributor to disease progression, with transcatheter interventions offering new therapeutic avenues. In advanced disease, innovations including donation after circulatory death and the development of total artificial heart systems offer promising solutions to overcome organ shortages and improve access to transplantation.

41129057,A Multidisciplinary Perspective on Semaglutide Treatment and Medical Nutrition Therapy in Obesity Management.,"This review explores the integration of semaglutide, a highly effective glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA), with medical nutritional therapy (MNT) for the comprehensive management of obesity. Semaglutide promotes significant weight loss and metabolic improvement, but optimal outcomes often require combining this pharmacological treatment with tailored nutritional interventions. This review focuses on two prominent dietary strategies whose nutritional profiles may complement semaglutide's mechanisms of action: the Mediterranean diet (MD) and very-low-energy ketogenic therapy (VLEKT). The MD emphasises balanced macronutrients and anti-inflammatory components, making it particularly suitable for individuals with uncomplicated obesity; it supports gradual and sustainable weight loss while mitigating inflammation and gastrointestinal side effects. Conversely, VLEKT, which induces nutritional ketosis, may be more appropriate for patients with significant cardiometabolic comorbidities, offering rapid and substantial fat mass reduction and improved glycaemic control. Both dietary approaches, when integrated with semaglutide therapy, have the potential to preserve lean body mass, reduce gastrointestinal adverse events, and enhance adherence through improved satiety and tolerability. The proposed integrated approach underscores the importance of personalised nutritional strategies guided by patient-specific metabolic, hormonal, and microbiota profiles, and calls for effective multidisciplinary collaboration among nutritionists, endocrinologists, and behavioural health professionals to optimise therapeutic outcomes. Ultimately, we emphasise that shifting the clinical focus from weight reduction alone to a targeted approach integrating semaglutide with evidence-based nutritional strategies may represent the most promising pathway towards sustainable obesity management.",2025,Oct,Current obesity reports,Luigi Barrea; Giuseppe Annunziata; Ludovica Verde; Martina Galasso; Silvia Savastano; Annamaria Colao; Giovanna Muscogiuri,1906,True,2025-10-01

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of various NITs in predicting obstructive CAD among individuals with symptoms suspected of CAD. This study analyzed data from the GEnetic Syntax Score (GESS) dataset, including 754 patients undergoing invasive coronary angiography (ICA) for suspected CAD. Six NITs, including the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, the Framingham steatosis index (FSI), the acNASH index, the fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI), and the hepatic steatosis index (HSI) were assessed for their association with obstructive CAD using logistic regression models, unadjusted and adjusted for potential covariates. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves by calculating the area under the curve (AUC) and performing formal hypothesis testing procedures through a stratified 10-fold cross-validation approach. TyG (odds ratio [OR]: 3.009, 95% CI: 2.223-4.126), FSI (OR: 1.185, 95% CI: 1.050-1.342), and APRI (OR: 2.350, 95% CI: 1.085-5.367), were found to be significantly associated with obstructive CAD.

We sought to compare the risk of presumed NAION in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), initiating a GLP-1RA versus a sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor (SGLT2i), using a new-user active comparator cohort study design within a target trial emulation framework. Using insurance claims data from three databases (01/2016-08/2024), we identified 482 912 propensity score matched (1:1) pairs of GLP-1RA and SGLT2i adult initiators with T2D and without prior ischemic optic neuropathy (ION) or other optic nerve disorders. NAION was defined as a diagnosis of ION without other causes of optic neuropathy, combined with an ophthalmologist or optometrist visit on the same day. We estimated pooled hazard ratios (HRs) and rate differences (RDs). Over a median follow-up of 6.7 months on treatment, the risk of incident NAION was higher among initiators of GLP-1RA compared with SGLT2i [HR, 1.85; 95% CI (1.51-2.27); RD, 0.29 (0.19, 0.39) per 1000 person-years]. Results were consistent across subgroups and sensitivity analyses. A meta-analysis of our semaglutide analysis with previously published results also showed an elevated risk, with a HR of 2.78 (1.39-5.56).

Understanding its association with the Homeostatic Model Assessment of Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) is essential, as HOMA-IR is a marker for insulin resistance. This study analyzed 700 adults from the NHANES 2017-2020, using the FAST score (with thresholds of ≥0.35 and ≥ 0.67) to identify individuals at high MASH risk. Logistic regression assessed HOMA-IR's association with MASH risk, while linear regression evaluated its link to liver stiffness measurement (LSM) and controlled attenuation parameter (CAP). Nonlinear associations were explored using restricted cubic splines (RCS), and BMI's mediation effects were examined through causal mediation analysis. MASH risk was significantly higher in the highest HOMA-IR quartile compared to the lowest (OR = 5.942, 95 %CI = 2.117-16.679, P = 0.001). RCS revealed nonlinear associations between HOMA-IR and both MASH risk (P = 0.007) and liver metrics (LSM: P = 0.045; CAP: P < 0.001). HOMA-IR correlated with increased hepatic steatosis and fibrosis severity. BMI mediated 34.26 % and 19.62 % of the associations for LSM and CAP, respectively.

41156997,Research on Shrinkage in Lithium Slag Geopolymer Mortar: Effects of Mix Proportions and a Shrinkage Prediction Model.,"Lithium slag (LS), a solid waste generated during lithium smelting, exhibits significant potential for geopolymer preparation. However, the high shrinkage of lithium slag geopolymer mortar (LSGM) severely restricts its engineering application. Currently, research on the effects of mix proportions (GBFS-LS mass ratio, water-binder ratio, and binder-sand ratio) on LSGM's shrinkage, and the correlation between shrinkage behavior and microstructures (pore structure and thermal behavior), remains insufficient. Additionally, there is a lack of targeted shrinkage prediction models for LSGM. To address these research gaps, this study systematically investigates the shrinkage characteristics of LSGM and develops a modified prediction model. Thermogravimetric analysis-differential thermal gravimetric analysis (TG-DTG) results show that a lower GBFS-LS ratio promotes the formation of dense sodium-alumino-silicate hydrate (N-A-S-H) gels. Meanwhile, mercury intrusion porosimetry (MIP) tests demonstrate that optimizing the water-binder ratio and binder-sand ratio refines the pore structure of LSGM, where the average pore size is reduced from 53.5 nm at a GBFS-LS ratio of 3 to 28.75 nm at a GBFS-LS ratio of 1.5.Quantitatively; compared with the group with a GBFS-LS ratio of 3, the 90-day shrinkage strain of the group with a GBFS-LS ratio of 1.5 decreases by 25.8%. When the water-binder ratio decreases from 0.57 to 0.27, the 90-day shrinkage strain reduces by 36.7%; in contrast, increasing the binder-sand ratio from 0.21 to 0.39 leads to a 39.8% increase in 90-day shrinkage strain.

Therefore, this study aimed to assess the relationship between dietary intake of amino acids or groups of amino acids and the risk of NAFLD. This case-control study included 171 participants with NAFLD and 730 controls from Tehran, Iran. A validated Food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) with 168 items, was used to evaluate dietary information. Odds ratios (ORs) and corresponding confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated by regression models, adjusted for potential confounders including age, sex, body mass index (BMI), smoking status, physical activity, history of diabetes mellitus, and total energy intake. The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of participants was 43.26 ± 13.9 years. Intake of total protein and all amino acids was significantly higher in patients with NAFLD than in the control group (P < 0.001). Increased risk of developing NAFLD compared to the reference quartile was observed in the highest quartiles of dietary isoleucine (OR, 4.72; 95%CI, 1.57-14.19), tyrosine (OR, 5.11, 95%CI, 1.73-15.05), threonine (OR, 3.47; 95%CI, 1.16-10.33), and valine (OR, 4.51; 95%CI, 1.45-14.02) intake. Subgroup analysis by sex revealed that in the females, the OR for NAFLD were 0.36 (95%CI, 0.13-0.98) among those with the highest intake of non-essential amino acids, and 2.78 (95%CI, 1.02-7.50) among those with the highest intake of essential amino acids compared to those in the first quartile.

40072011,Therapeutic Potential of GLP-1 Receptor Agonists in Metabolic Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"To summarize the current knowledge on the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 receptor agonists in managing metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). A literature review was conducted using the search terms  All relevant clinical trials, review articles, package inserts, and guidelines evaluating clinically relevant evidence regarding the therapeutic potential of GLP-1 agonists in MASLD were considered for inclusion. GLP-1 RAs have shown promising results in MASLD treatment. Semaglutide has demonstrated efficacy in reducing liver fat content, inflammation, and fibrosis, with clinical trials indicating improvements in hepatic biomarkers and cardiometabolic risk factors. Similarly, tirzepatide has been associated with substantial weight loss and significant reductions in liver fat and fibrosis markers. Both agents exert their effects through mechanisms involving improved insulin sensitivity, reduced lipid accumulation, and attenuation of hepatic inflammation. Given the high prevalence of MASLD in patients with obesity and type 2 diabetes, tirzepatide and semaglutide could play a critical role in clinical practice by addressing multiple facets of the disease. Both agents have shown potential in reducing liver fat, improving hepatic biomarkers, and mitigating cardiometabolic risks, which are leading causes of morbidity and mortality in MASLD patients. Incorporating these therapies into MASLD treatment guidelines could significantly enhance patient outcomes by targeting both liver-related and systemic complications of the disease. GLP1 RAs show great potential in managing MASLD by promoting weight loss, improving glycemic control, and reducing liver inflammation.",2025,Oct,The Annals of pharmacotherapy,Klaudia Nowak; Krzysztof Łupina; Anna Romac; Aleksandra Kalisz; Łucja Ilkiewicz; Jakub Janczura,1694,True,2025-10-01

We gathered data on NAFLD incidence and mortality from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study 2019, as well as air pollution exposure data obtained from the World Bank database. A mixed-effects regression model was employed to examine the associations, adjusting for potential confounders. A total of 189 countries were included in the analysis. The global incidence rate of NAFLD was 559.95 per 100,000 people, with a mortality rate of 1.93 per 100,000. Countries with greater exposure to NO2, ozone, and PM2.5 had significantly higher NAFLD incidence (Regression Estimate per 1 SD increase (RESD) in NO2[SE] = 8.82[1.15], P-value < 0.001; RESD ozone[SE] = 17.97[1.37], P-value < 0.001; RESD PM2.5[SE] = 35.09[2.57], P-value < 0.001) and lower death rates (RESD NO2[SE] =-0.14[0.01], P-value < 0.001; RESD ozone[SE] =-0.22[0.02], P-value < 0.001; RESD PM2.5[SE] =-0.20[0.03], P-value < 0.001), particularly in countries with higher HDI. However, low-HDI countries exhibited no significant relationship between air pollution and NAFLD incidence while showing a significant positive correlation between pollutant exposure and NAFLD mortality. While air pollution is linked to higher NAFLD incidence globally, its relationship with mortality varies, particularly in low-HDI countries. These results suggest a need for region-specific approaches, considering the ecological context.

41110921,Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Failure Society 2025 Guideline Update for Pharmacologic Management of Heart Failure With Nonreduced Ejection Fraction (LVEF > 40%).,"Heart failure with nonreduced ejection fraction (HFnrEF), defined as signs and symptoms of heart failure (HF) with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of > 40%, continues to increase in prevalence with significant effects to patients, their care givers, and the health care system broadly. Historically, this population has been divided into HF with mildly reduced (HFmrEF) or HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). However, contemporary evidence indicates that patients across the spectrum of LVEF > 40% experience similar clinical outcomes and, importantly, respond consistently to several key pharmacotherapies. Adoption of the term HFnrEF provides a practical and unified framework for clinical decision-making, reducing ambiguity and promoting consistent application of evidence-based therapies. To support clinicians in translating evidence into practice, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (CCS) and the Canadian Heart Failure Society (CHFS) present this guideline, which is focused on pharmacological management of symptomatic heart failure with nonreduced ejection fraction (HFnrEF). Underpinned by Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology and meta-analyses, outcomes of interest include pharmacotherapies shown to reduce the risk of HF hospitalization (HFH) and improve patient well-being in this population. The guideline offers concise recommendations for 4 key classes of pharmacological therapies: sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs), and evidence-based drugs with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist activity. Recommendations are complemented by practical tips to guide the initiation, titration, and maintenance of these foundational treatments. By emphasizing therapeutic consistency across the > 40% LVEF spectrum, this guideline aims to streamline care pathways and enhance the delivery of guideline-directed medical therapy for patients with symptomatic HFnrEF in real-world settings.",2025,Oct,The Canadian journal of cardiology,Sean Virani; Shelley Zieroth; Natasha Aleksova; Kim Anderson; Brian Clarke; Anique Ducharme; Justin A Ezekowitz; Farid Foroutan; Nadia Giannetti; Rahul Jain; Douglas Lee; Serge Lepage; Kristin Lyons; Michael McDonald; Caroline McGuinty; Lisa Mielniczuk; Eileen O'Meara; Stephanie Poon; Kyla Siatecki; Elizabeth Swiggum; Mustafa Toma; Ricky D Turgeon; Marc Bains; Margot K Davis; Sabe De; Nowell Fine; Jodi Heshka; Sabina Keen; Alexandra King; Andrea Lavoie; Susanna Mak; Lynn McCleary; Oussama Outbih; Rodolfo Pike; Abhinav Sharma; Harriette G C Van Spall; Amelia Ming Ching Yip,2094,True,2025-10-01
40884700,Impact of Levothyroxine on Progression to and Complications of Cirrhosis in MASH.,"Resmetirom, a liver-targeted thyroid hormone receptor-β (THR-β) agonist, used to treat MASH, shares a similar mechanism of action with levothyroxine, a nonselective (THR-α/β) receptor agonist used to treat hypothyroidism. Given the potential effect of levothyroxine on THR-β, we hypothesized that it may have beneficial effects in MASH patients. We used TriNetX to examine patients aged ≥ 18 years with MASH treated with levothyroxine from 1/1/16 to 1/1/25. Patients prescribed levothyroxine (levothyroxine group) were compared to those not receiving them (control group). Patients with previous cirrhosis or liver transplant were excluded. To control for disease severity and underlying comorbidities, propensity score matching (PSM) was performed. Of 109,268 patients with MASH, 17,629 (16%) received levothyroxine. Following PSM, we examined 15,076 patients in each group. MASH patients with or without levothyroxine treatment were predominantly White females, with a mean [SD] bilirubin, INR, and creatinine of 0.6 [0.7], 1.1 [0.4], and 0.9 [1.2], respectively. Comorbidities, BMIs, and MASH therapies including GLP-1s, SGLT-2s, and statins were similar in both groups. Over a mean [SD] follow-up of 2.8 [1.8] years, patients receiving levothyroxine had a similar rate of progression to cirrhosis (HR: 1.08; 95% CI 0.97-1.21; p = 0.16) as patients not on levothyroxine. In patients who developed cirrhosis, those receiving levothyroxine had a small, but statistically significantly higher risk of developing any portal hypertensive complication (HR: 1.33; 95% CI 1.18-1.49; p < 0.001) than those not receiving levothyroxine. MASH patients prescribed levothyroxine had a similar rate of progression to cirrhosis and a slightly higher rate of portal hypertension complications than those not prescribed levothyroxine.",2025,Oct,Digestive diseases and sciences,Abhinav K Rao; Don C Rockey,1820,True,2025-10-01
41123491,Dietary monounsaturated fatty acid facilitates lipid droplet turnover through chaperone HSP90A-mediated lysosomal degradation of PLIN2 in hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Dietary lipids are emerging as critical regulators of tumor metabolism. However, the understanding of how dietary lipid molecules remodel tumor metabolism to drive malignancy remains incomplete. In this study, we revealed that monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs) selectively promote hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression by rewiring lipid droplet (LD) metabolism through a selective autophagy mechanism. Proteomic profiling of LD-binding proteins identified HSP90A (heat shock protein 90 alpha) as a MUFA-induced factor translocated to LDs. The recruitment of HSP90A subsequently initiated the breakdown of LDs, releasing FAs from LDs for mitochondrial respiration. Mechanistically, MUFAs facilitated the specific interaction between HSP90A and PLIN2 to stimulate the degradation of PLIN2 in non-canonical lysosomal pathway. Although this process requires LAMP2A, similar to chaperone-mediated autophagy, it relies on HSP90 rather than HSPA8/HSC70 for the recognition of PLIN2. Targeting HSP90A dampened LD mobilization and effectively prevented orthotopic HCC tumor growth induced by dietary MUFA. Collectively, our data demonstrated that dietary MUFA exhibits a distinctive tumor-promoting effect on HCC through HSP90A-mediated LD mobilization and suggested that targeting HSP90A-regulated autophagy may serve as a therapeutic strategy for the treatment of HCC.",2025,Oct,Autophagy,Xiaoqing Luo; Jinqing Zhao; Qianqian Chen; Dianhan Liu; Qiannan Lu; Chuan Tian; Huan Liu; Xinyu Yu; Jia He; Xiong Z Ruan; Ping Yang; Yaxi Chen,1369,True,2025-10-01
41007643,Resmetirom for MASH: A Comprehensive Review of a Novel Therapeutic Frontier.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a progressive liver disease linked to type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity, and dyslipidaemia, which are all parts of the metabolic syndrome. In 2024, for non-cirrhotic MASH with mild to advanced fibrosis, resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist, became the first FDA-approved treatment for this condition. By increasing β-oxidation and lipid metabolism, it minimises systemic thyroid or cardiac effects while reducing hepatic fat, inflammation, and fibrosis. Resmetirom is being developed for use in combination with lifestyle interventions, such as diet and exercise, to maximize patient benefit. Nevertheless, the lack of congruence between clinical trial populations and real-world payer criteria underscores access obstacles that necessitate policy reform. The successful delivery of screening programs depends on the education of providers from various disciplines and the establishment of uniform screening standards. Future studies should investigate the clinical application of resmetirom in combination with agents that may provide additional benefits, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, SGLT2 inhibitors, and statins. These results are significant in light of recent long-term safety monitoring of these agents, particularly regarding the thyroid axis. Ensuring equitable uptake will be crucial, as it involves defining fair access through payer endpoints, conducting cost-effectiveness analysis, and considering patient-reported outcomes. Resmetirom represents a breakthrough in MASH management, offering potential metabolic benefits in conjunction with comprehensive clinical and lifestyle approaches.",2025,Aug,Biomedicines,Angad Tiwari; Ashish Sharma; Harendra Kumar; Varnika Gupta; Vishal Deshpande; Jaya Sai Mupparaju; Tanisha Mishra; Hareesha Rishab Bharadwaj; Dushyant Singh Dahiya; Varun Jain,1685,True,2025-08-01

41125168,Effects of semaglutide on vessel morphology: Studies on the chicken chorioallantoic membrane.,"Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists are widely used to manage type 2 diabetes and promote weight loss. Semaglutide (SEM)-a long acting GLP-1-has experienced an extraordinary surge in popularity since its approval in 2017. Between 2021 and 2023, SEM prescription fills in the U.S. climbed to 2.56 million per month. Yet, the uptake of SEM into larger populations has raised safety concerns, with provocative findings now suggesting that SEM could negatively affect ocular and reproductive systems, counter to its beneficial effects on the heart. At least some of these concerns involve SEMs ability to alter vascular morphology in these organs. Herein, we study the impact of SEM on vasculature using the well-established chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM). This in vivo model mimics vascular beds found in the human eye and placenta and can approximate the effects of drugs on these organs. The CAM also responds to vasoactive drugs in a similar way to the coronary arteries of the heart. Hence, the CAM provides a convenient system to simultaneously interrogate the impact of SEM on ocular, reproductive, and coronary vascular biology. Our studies show that SEM causes vessels to develop with fewer branching points, yielding longer and more direct connections, that shift local blow flow patterns. However, these changes are only significant at SEM concentrations well above the therapeutic dose.",2025,Oct,Microvascular research,Pei-Hsuan Chen; Samar Abood; Steven Bloom,1417,True,2025-10-01
41085908,The Emerging Therapeutic Promise of SGLT2 Inhibitors in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"This review aims to synthesize preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the therapeutic potential of Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) in Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We conducted a comprehensive literature review. Our analysis encompassed both mechanistic studies and clinical trials to summarize the pharmacologic profile of SGLT2i and the pathophysiological basis of MASLD. SGLT2i confer multifaceted benefits in MASLD by targeting core pathological processes. They ameliorate hepatic steatosis by promoting fatty acid β-oxidation and inhibiting lipogenesis, improve insulin sensitivity, and attenuate inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. Additional mechanisms involve gut microbiota modulation and autophagy activation. Clinically, SGLT2i use is associated with reduced liver enzymes, improved histological features, and potentially suppressed hepatocarcinogenesis, with benefits observed in patients with and without type 2 diabetes. Emerging data suggest synergistic effects from SGLT2i-based combination therapies. SGLT2i represent a promising, multifaceted therapeutic strategy for MASLD, addressing its metabolic-inflammatory drivers while providing extrahepatic cardiorenal protection. Their repurposing is supported by a favorable safety profile. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes and combination therapy trials to solidify their role in MASLD management.",2025,Oct,Digestive diseases and sciences,Wenjing Zhang; Huaidong Hu,1451,True,2025-10-01
41087898,Characterization of the gut mycobiome in patients with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and correlations with serum metabolome.,"Emerging evidence suggests that the gut microbiome plays a key role in metabolic diseases such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, yet the contribution of the gut mycobiome remains largely overlooked. We performed a comprehensive analysis of publicly available fecal metagenomic sequencing data and matched serum metabolomic profiles from 90 non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients and 90 healthy controls. A curated fungal genome database was constructed for taxonomic profiling. We integrated fungal, bacterial, and metabolomic data to assess taxon-specific associations, cross-kingdom interactions, and predictive potential. Although overall fungal diversity showed no significant differences between groups, four fungal species-Pseudopithomyces sp. c174, Mucor sp. c176, Aspergillus sp. c25, and Ascochyta c213-were significantly enriched in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease patients. The gut mycobiome explained 38.2% of the variance in serum metabolomic profiles, with several species displaying strong correlations with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease relevant metabolites. For instance, Pseudopithomyces sp. c174 was positively associated with protective metabolites such as glycoursodeoxycholic acid and alpha-linolenic acid, while Aureobasidium c170 and Basipetospora c193 were linked to phenylacetic acid, a metabolite implicated in hepatic lipid accumulation. Network analysis revealed altered fungal-bacterial co-abundance patterns in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, with fungal taxa such as Alternaria alternata c42 and Malassezia c303 emerging as key hubs. A random forest classifier integrating 42 bacterial and fungal features achieved an AUC of 0.772 for distinguishing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease from controls, highlighting the predictive value of the mycobiome. Our findings reveal that gut fungal communities are functionally and ecologically altered in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and contribute to shaping the host metabolic environment. These results underscore the need to incorporate the gut mycobiome into future microbiome-based strategies for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease diagnosis and treatment.",2025,Oct,BMC microbiology,Ning Zheng; Dangrang Wang; Guorui Xing; Yidan Gao; Shenghui Li; Jin Liu; Jian Kang; Shanshan Sha; Lin Cheng; Shao Fan; Jian Yu; Qiulong Yan; Chunmeng Jiang,2155,True,2025-10-01

However, the relationship between serum osmolality (OSM) and MASLD odds in adults remains unclear. This cross-sectional study analyzed NHANES data (2017-March 2020). MASLD was defined as hepatic steatosis (controlled attenuation parameter >248 dB/m) plus at least one metabolic risk factor. Serum OSM was calculated using the ESPEN-recommended equation. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) and weighted logistic regression analyses were performed, adjusting for age, sex, poverty-income ratio (PIR), race, smoking, drinking, energy intake, and physical activity. Subgroup analyses were conducted to enhance the robustness of the results. Among 3,799 participants, higher serum OSM (Q4 vs. Q1) was associated with increased odds of MASLD in unadjusted (OR=2.02, 95% CI 1.29-3.16), partially adjusted (OR=1.64, 95% CI 1.08-2.49), and fully adjusted models (OR=1.60, 95% CI 1.02-2.50).

41087767,Zhuyu pill mitigates NAFLD through activation of IL22/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway.,"This study aims to investigate the lipid-lowering, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant effects of Zhuyu Pill in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and to determine whether its therapeutic action is mediated through modulation of the IL-22/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. In animal experiments, C57BL/6 mice were fed a high-fat diet for 17 weeks to induce a NAFLD model. They were randomly divided into a control group, a Zhuyu Pill treatment group, and a positive control group, and the intervention lasted for 6 weeks. Mouse liver tissue and serum were collected for biochemical analysis of blood lipids and liver enzyme activities. Liver sections were processed for HE staining and Oil Red O staining to evaluate histopathological changes and lipid accumulation. ELISA was employed to quantify inflammatory factor levels, while DCFH-DA and MitoSOX staining used to detect reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the liver. In cell experiments, mouse liver cells AML-12 were used as a model, and cells were treated with free fatty acids to simulate the NAFLD microenvironment. ELISA was used to detect changes in the expression of inflammatory factors and detecting the levels of cellular ROS and mitochondrial ROS. In addition, siRNA technology was used to silence IL-22 and activate the JAK/STAT signaling pathway with Colivelin. The changes in lipid deposition and ROS signaling in cells were observed, and the expression changes of IL-22/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway related proteins were detected by WB method. In animal experiments, the detection results of serum biochemical indicators in mice showed that Zhuyu Pill can effectively reduce the levels of ALT, AST, TC, TG, LDL-C, and HDL-C. HE and Oil Red O staining revealed that Zhuyu Pill markedly alleviated hepatic lipid accumulation and inflammatory infiltration. The results of inflammatory factors showed that treatment with Zhuyu Pill significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory factors IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1 β, and MCP-1 in mouse serum, while increasing the expression of IL-22. The results of DCFH-DA and MitoSOX staining methods showed that Zhuyu Pill could significantly reduce the level of ROS in the liver tissue of NAFLD mice. In vitro experiments showed that treatment with Zhuyu Pill significantly reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-α, IL-1 β, and MCP-1 in NAFLD cell models, increased the expression of IL-22, significantly reduced ROS levels, increased the expression of p-JAK1 protein, p-STAT3 protein, BCL-2 protein, and reduced the expression of BAX protein. SiRNA-mediated IL-22 silencing markedly attenuated the therapeutic effects of Zhuyu Pill on reducing lipid deposition and enhancing antioxidant defense, and also diminished its ability to activate the IL-22/JAK1/STAT3 signaling pathway. Meanwhile, STAT3 activator Colivelin was able to partially reverse the effects of IL-22 silencing. Zhuyu Pill can regulate lipid metabolism, inhibit inflammatory response, alleviate oxidative stress, and activate the IL-22/JAK1/STAT3/BCL-2 signaling pathway to improve NAFLD.",2025,Oct,Journal of molecular histology,Tong Wang; Xiaobo Zhang; Tao Shen; Zubing Zhou,3079,True,2025-10-01

Some AD patients show signs of metabolic dysfunction as well. This review focuses on the potential mechanisms associated with these two diseases, like insulin resistance, inflammation, oxidative damage, mitochondrial injury, and cell death. One of the notable elements in this connection is the ""brain insulin resistance,"" most frequently named as ""type 3 diabetes,"" which impairs glucose metabolism and facilitates amyloid beta (Aβ) plaque synthesis while reducing the action of insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE). Moreover, the overactivity of glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) also triggers taurine protein pathology. Raised concentrations of glucose in blood can produce advanced glycation end products (AGEs), which further exacerbate neuroinflammation in tandem with the mitigation of neurotoxic Aβ oligomers. Inflammation and subsequent damage to mitochondria lead to the dissolution of synapses. Current vascular insults include the breakdown of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and decreased brain perfusion, along with other contributory factors to conditions conducive to neurotoxicity. Recently, novel therapies are emerging, including GLP-1 agonists, intranasal insulin, and mitochondrial antioxidants, that show surprising results for treating both conditions, but on the contrary, bioavailability and the timing of interventions remain a big challenge in the management of these diseases. Eventually, further research should center on understanding the mechanisms of integration along with the development of molecular biology, neuroimaging, and outcome-driven treatment strategies.

41072427,[Hepatocellular Carcinoma: from Screening to Therapy].,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most common primary liver malignancy and a leading cause of cancer-related death worldwide. The incidence is increasing globally, primarily due to the rising prevalence of chronic liver diseases. While chronic viral hepatitis (HBV, HCV) and alcohol abuse have traditionally been considered the main risk factors, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is increasingly gaining importance, especially in Western industrialized nations. In the vast majority of cases, HCC develops on the basis of liver cirrhosis. When cirrhosis is present, diagnosis can usually be reliably made through dynamic imaging techniques. However, despite established surveillance programs, most cases of HCC are often diagnosed only at advanced stages, which significantly limits therapeutic options. The treatment of HCC depends on tumor stage, overall health, and liver function of the affected patients. Selecting the appropriate therapy requires a multidisciplinary decision-making process. While curative options include resection, transplantation, and local ablation, advanced stages are managed with loco-regional therapies or systemic treatments. In recent years, the therapeutic spectrum has been significantly expanded by the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors. Particularly, immunotherapeutic combination therapies approved for first-line treatment have significantly improved the overall survival of patients with advanced HCC.

The data were obtained with the CMS detector at the LHC and correspond to an integrated luminosity of 186.0±6.5  nb^{-1}. A significant azimuthal dependence of the hyperon polarization, characterized by the second-order Fourier sine coefficient P_{z,s2}, is observed. The P_{z,s2} values decrease as a function of charged particle multiplicity, but increase with transverse momentum. A hydrodynamic model that describes the observed P_{z,s2} values in nucleus-nucleus collisions by introducing vorticity effects does not reproduce either the sign or the magnitude of the p-Pb results.

41133428,Fat-Corrected Non-Gaussian Diffusion MRI for Liver Fibrosis Assessment in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"In patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), non-Gaussian diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) has been proposed for the diagnosis of liver fibrosis, but its measurement is partially confounded by steatosis. We therefore asked whether a fat-corrected approach could improve fibrosis assessment. To evaluate the diagnostic performance of non-Gaussian diffusion coefficients for the assessment of fibrosis in MASLD patients with a method accounting for intravoxel fat. Prospective single-center cross-sectional study. A total of 289 participants with Type 2 diabetes, hepatic steatosis, and elevated aminotransferases were enrolled from October 2018 to June 2021. Among them, 222 participants (mean age 59 ± 10 years; 149 men) underwent liver biopsy and MRI and were included in the final analysis. 3 T, DWI using spin-echo echo-planar imaging, MR elastography (MRE) using gradient echo sequence and fat fraction imaging using a multiple gradient echoes sequence. Diffusion coefficients were estimated using two non-Gaussian models: a shifted apparent diffusion coefficient (sADC) and a non-linear least squares fit (ngADC), both computed without and with intravoxel fat correction (corr) using fat fraction on PDFF. Fibrosis was staged histologically. Quantitative parameters were compared across fibrosis stages. Diagnostic performance for F0 versus ≥ F1 was evaluated and compared to liver stiffness on MRE. Group comparisons used Kruskal-Wallis tests (α = 0.05), and diagnostic performance was assessed via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis with 95% confidence intervals, with p < 0.05 considered statistically significant. ngADC Fit-based non-Gaussian DWI with fat correction could potentially be used with similar diagnostic accuracy as MRE for detecting fibrosis in patients with MASLD. 3. Stage 2. Liver disease related to fat accumulation is common in people with metabolic problems, such as Type 2 diabetes. Detecting early liver scarring (fibrosis) is important, but standard MRI measurements can be affected by fat in the liver. In this study, researchers tested a new MRI method that adjusts for liver fat when measuring water movement in the liver. They found that this fat‐corrected approach could identify liver fibrosis similarly to a widely used but more complex technique called MR elastography. These findings suggest that fat‐corrected MRI may help doctors detect liver fibrosis more reliably in patients with fatty liver disease.",2025,Oct,Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI,Omaïma Saïd; Sabrina Doblas; Valérie Paradis; Pierre Bedossa; Dominique Valla; Cédric Laouénan; Laurent Castera; Bernard E Van Beers; Philippe Garteiser,2505,True,2025-10-01
40786064,Exploring hepatic stellate cell-driven fibrosis: therapeutic advances and future perspectives.,"Liver fibrosis, a progressive liver disease arising from viral or metabolic causes, poses a major global health challenge due to its potential progression to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Due to the complex aetiology and epidemiology of liver fibrosis, most therapies fail in the clinic, and very few drugs have been approved by the US FDA. This review highlights the pathophysiological features of liver fibrosis, with a focus on novel targets in hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), key players in the fibrogenesis process, to develop successful therapeutic approaches using both pharmacological agents and active targeting strategies. The review also examines current therapeutic strategies targeting liver fibrosis, both in preclinical lab setups and clinical trials. Furthermore, various receptors involved in HSC-mediated liver fibrosis and active drug delivery targeting strategies are reviewed to enhance therapeutic outcomes. This article also integrates existing knowledge to identify research gaps and guide future investigations and clinical translation in liver fibrosis treatment. In addition, novel pathways pertaining to liver fibrosis, such as the RSPO3-LGR4/5-β-catenin cascade, the CD47/YAP/TEAD4 signalling axis, and HAb18G/CD147, are briefly elaborated in the context of therapeutic approaches for arresting HSC activation. Single-cell RNA sequencing of HSCs is presented to provide a clearer picture of liver fibrosis. The review highlights critical research gaps in liver fibrosis therapy and promising active targeting strategies and pharmacological interventions to improve therapeutic outcomes. Overall, this review provides a robust foundation for scientists and clinicians to advance active targeting of the disease pathology and to develop new pharmaceutical formulations that are pharmacologically safer and more efficacious.",2025,01,ADMET & DMPK,Alka Singh; Ansab Akhtar; Prashant Shukla,1860,True,2025-01-01

41122154,Effects of rifaximin in fructose-induced steatohepatitis in rats.,"Metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and its related mortality are increasing worldwide. This study evaluated the potential of rifaximin in preventing and treating steatohepatitis induced by a high-fructose diet by modulating intestinal pathology. Forty-two rats were randomly divided into six groups: one group received a normal diet, another was fed a fructose diet, two groups received rifaximin (once or three times weekly) along with a fructose diet, and the remaining two groups were given rifaximin (once or three times weekly) with a normal diet. After eight weeks, liver tissues were examined for malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α, nuclear factor-κB, and nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 using Western blot analysis, while blood samples were analyzed for uric acid, liver enzymes, triglycerides, and cholesterol; plasma tumor necrosis factor-α was measured by ELISA. The fructose diet group showed significant increases in body and liver weights, ballooning degeneration, lobular inflammation, and macrovesicular steatosis. Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease developed in 21 rats, yet steatohepatitis was observed only in the fructose-only group. Biochemical markers, including liver enzymes, triglycerides, and cholesterol, were significantly elevated in the fructose group. Moreover, plasma and tissue tumor necrosis factor-α and nuclear factor-κB levels were higher in the fructose group (p=0.03), while Nrf-2 levels were elevated in the rifaximin-treated groups (p=0.043). Additionally, MDA levels were markedly increased in the fructose-only group (p=0.033) and decreased dose-dependently with rifaximin treatment (p=0.029). These findings suggest that rifaximin's anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects may alleviate fructose-induced steatohepatitis, although further clinical studies are warranted.",2025,01,Hepatology forum,Nese Cabuk Celik; Rumeysa Yilmaz Goc; Ibrahim Halil Bahcecioglu; I Hanifi Ozercan; Mehmet Tuzcu; Necip Ilhan; Kazim Sahin,1878,True,2025-01-01
41145880,Effects of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors in patients with type 2 diabetes and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease: A cohort study.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) are a novel group of oral medications used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), a complication of T2DM, is now recognized as one of the most frequent causes of chronic liver disorders. We aimed to investigate the effects of SGLT2is on hepatic function and glucose homeostasis in patients with T2DM and comorbid NAFLD. To our knowledge, this is the first study in the Arab region to compare the effects of SGLT2is and other antidiabetic medications and to evaluate the outcomes after a 6-month follow-up period in this patient cohort. This cohort study involved 100 patients with T2DM. The patients were divided equally into two groups. The exposed group comprised 50 patients receiving any of the SGLT2is (empagliflozin or dapagliflozin); the non-exposed group comprised 50 patients taking any other oral antidiabetic medication (other than glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2is). The outcomes investigated were glycemic control, hepatic function, and liver fibrosis parameters, investigated at baseline and after 6 months. Significant improvements in glycemic control, hepatic function, and fibrosis parameters were observed in the SGLT2i group after 6 months, as evidenced by laboratory and clinical data (p < 0.001). Significant improvements were observed in hemoglobin A1c, Fibrosis-4 index, gamma-glutamyl transferase level, alanine aminotransferase level, and NAFLD fibrosis score (p < 0.05). The findings indicate that 6 months of SGLT2i therapy improved fibrosis and glucose homeostasis in patients with T2DM and NAFLD. Therefore, SGLT2is are effective therapeutic agents in this patient population.",2025,Oct,Saudi pharmaceutical journal : SPJ : the official publication of the Saudi Pharmaceutical Society,Rania Naguib; Nouran Aleyeidi; Hend Naguib,1722,True,2025-10-01

A narrative review.,"An increasing number of patients treated with novel antidiabetic drugs, including glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor agonists and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, are presenting in the perioperative period. GLP-1RAs are known to delay gastric emptying, although current data remain preliminary and somewhat conflicting. SGLT2 inhibitors may be associated with euglycemic ketoacidosis in the perioperative period. To assess residual gastric content, gastric ultrasound may serve as a valuable tool in stratifying aspiration risk. Various recommendations are available for the perioperative management of patients on GLP-1RAs or SGLT2 inhibitors. These are based largely on expert opinion and multi-society consensus. This review aims to summarise the key perioperative considerations related to these drug classes and to familiarise practitioners with their pharmacological profiles. We highlight their potential adverse effects and present current recommendations from professional organisations to support safe and effective perioperative management.",2025,Sep,Anaesthesiology intensive therapy,Oliwia Doroba; Leszek Czupryniak; Filippo Sanfilippo; Paweł Andruszkiewicz; Mateusz Zawadka,1147,True,2025-09-01

41071800,Trends and projections of the global burden of T2DM-associated CKD related to high BMI: A global burden of disease study 2021.,"Type 2 diabetic-associated chronic kidney disease (T2DM-Associated CKD), a leading cause of end-stage renal disease, is exacerbated by rising particularly high body mass index (BMI) rates. This study examines the global burden of T2DM-Associated CKD attributable to high BMI from 1990 to 2021 and projects future trends using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2021 data. GBD 2021 data from 204 countries were analyzed to assess mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) and corresponding age-standardized rates of T2DM-Associated CKD linked to high BMI. Bayesian Age-Period-Cohort modeling was used for projections, with stratification by age, gender, and Socio-Demographic Index (SDI). Statistical analyses were conducted using R software. In 2021, high BMI-related T2DM-Associated CKD caused 173,263 deaths and 4.3 million DALYs. Age-standardized rates declined globally but showed regional disparities, with Andean Latin America having the highest burden. Women had higher absolute burdens, while men showed higher standardized rates. Projections indicate continued increases in mortality and DALY rates through 2050. Emerging therapies, such as GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) and SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), could potentially alter these trends, especially in high-risk regions. High BMI significantly drives the T2DM-Associated CKD burden, necessitating targeted overweight/obesity prevention and improved healthcare access, particularly in high-risk regions. Monitoring trends is crucial for effective interventions.",2025,01,PloS one,Jing Zhang; Wenxuan Li; Zhen Sun; Yunyang Wang; Yu Xue; Ke Si; Yajing Huang; Wenshan Lv; Lili Xu; Yangang Wang,1530,True,2025-01-01
41127305,The Construction and Performance Evaluation of a Risk Prediction Model for Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis Based on Serological Markers.,"To develop a noninvasive clinical diagnostic model based on serological markers for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and to verify its predictive efficacy. A total of 82 biopsy-proven patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) were included in the study. Patients were classified into nonalcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and NASH groups based on the results of liver biopsies. The study utilized the LASSO regression model for variable selection, followed by logistic regression analysis to create a prediction model. A nomogram was then developed to illustrate this model. To validate the model, bootstrapping was applied for internal validation, and the accuracy, consistency, and clinical utility of the prediction model were evaluated. The NASH group had significantly higher levels of red blood cell count, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT), while levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were significantly lower in the NASH group ( AST and ceruloplasmin are independent risk factors associated with NASH. The CHART2 prediction model based on serological markers demonstrates good accuracy, consistency, and clinical utility. The model could serve as a noninvasive approach to identifying patients with NASH, which might reduce the need for liver biopsy.",2025,01,Gastroenterology research and practice,Dongbo Huang; Wanqin Zhang; Ying Fang; Taotao Liu; Da Zhou,1348,True,2025-01-01
41093891,A preliminary study of the physiological and perceptual effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists during alcohol consumption in people with obesity.,"Any increase in alcohol use is associated with an increase in risk of illness and mortality and consequences of chronic alcohol use include cancer, hypertension, heart and liver disease, and Alcohol Use Disorder. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are effective anti-glycemic and weight-loss medications with a strong safety record. There is substantial preclinical evidence and mounting retrospective and prospective randomized controlled trial evidence that GLP-1RAs could be effective for reducing alcohol consumption. However, the mechanism by which GLP-1RAs reduce alcohol intake remains unclear. While medications that reduce alcohol intake such as naltrexone and acamprosate have central nervous system action, disulfiram reduces alcohol intake through peripheral mechanisms. Here, we test whether GLP-1RAs alter alcohol's peripheral pharmacokinetics as a potential mechanism of action for their alcohol intake suppressive effects. In this pilot study, 20 (1:1) participants with obesity in the GLP-1RA or control group consumed a challenge dose of alcohol, and we measured breath alcohol (BrAC) and the subjective effects of alcohol. We observed a delayed rise in BrAC and subjective effects in the GLP-1RA group as compared to controls, that was not explained by nausea. These data provide preliminary evidence that GLP-1RAs could act through peripheral mechanisms to suppress alcohol intake.",2025,Oct,Scientific reports,Fatima Quddos; Mary Fowler; Ana Carolina de Lima Bovo; Zacarya Elbash; Allison N Tegge; Kirstin M Gatchalian; Anita S Kablinger; Alexandra G DiFeliceantonio; Warren K Bickel,1420,True,2025-10-01

41138739,Semaglutide and cardiovascular outcomes by baseline and changes in adiposity measurements: a prespecified analysis of the SELECT trial.,"The SELECT trial found semaglutide reduced major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with overweight or obesity with cardiovascular disease but without diabetes. We report a prespecified analysis of the SELECT trial on the relationships between baseline adiposity measures, treatment-induced adiposity changes, and subsequent MACE risk. Patients aged at least 45 years, with a BMI of at least 27 kg/m Semaglutide significantly reduced MACE incidence compared with placebo among 17 604 patients enrolled in SELECT, with consistent benefits across all baseline weight and waist circumference categories. In the semaglutide group, analyses for linear trends showed lower baseline bodyweight and waist circumference were associated with lower incidence of MACE-an average 4% reduction in risk per 5 kg lower bodyweight (hazard ratio [HR] 0·96 [95% CI 0·94-0·99]; p=0·001) and per 5 cm smaller waist circumference (0·96 [0·93-0·99]; p=0·004). In the placebo group, lower baseline waist circumference (0·96 [0·94-0·99]; p=0·007), but not bodyweight (0·99 [0·97-1·01]; p=0·28), was associated with a lower MACE risk and weight loss was paradoxically associated with increased MACE risk. In those receiving semaglutide there was no linear trend linking weight loss at week 20 to subsequent MACE risk, but greater waist circumference reduction at week 20 was associated with lower subsequent MACE risk, and waist circumference reduction by week 104 was associated with lower in-trial risk of MACE. An estimated 33% of the observed benefit on MACE was mediated through waist circumference reduction (HR 0·86 [95% CI 0·77-0·97] after adjustment for time-varying changes in waist circumference). The cardioprotective effects of semaglutide were independent of baseline adiposity and weight loss and had only a small association with waist circumference, suggesting some mechanisms for benefit beyond adiposity reduction.

41023486,Prevention of type 2 diabetes through prediabetes remission without weight loss.,"Clinical practice guidelines recommend defined weight loss goals for the prevention of type 2 diabetes (T2D) in those individuals with increased risk, such as prediabetes. However, achieving prediabetes remission, that is, reaching normal glucose regulation according to American Diabetes Association criteria, is more efficient in preventing T2D than solely reaching weight loss goals. Here we present a post hoc analysis of the large, multicenter, randomized, controlled Prediabetes Lifestyle Intervention Study (PLIS), demonstrating that prediabetes remission is achievable without weight loss or even weight gain, and that it also protects against incident T2D. The underlying mechanisms include improved insulin sensitivity, β-cell function and increments in β-cell-GLP-1 sensitivity. Weight gain was similar in those achieving prediabetes remission (responders) compared with nonresponders; however, adipose tissue was differentially redistributed in responders and nonresponders when compared against each other-while nonresponders increased visceral adipose tissue mass, responders increased adipose tissue in subcutaneous depots. The findings were reproduced in the US Diabetes Prevention Program. These data uncover essential pathways for prediabetes remission without weight loss and emphasize the need to include glycemic targets in current clinical practice guidelines to improve T2D prevention.",2025,Oct,Nature medicine,Arvid Sandforth; Elsa Vazquez Arreola; Robert L Hanson; Nicolai J Wewer Albrechtsen; Jens Juul Holst; Robert Ahrends; Cristina Coman; Felicia Gerst; Estela Lorza-Gil; Yurong Cheng; Leontine Sandforth; Sarah Katzenstein; Marlene Ganslmeier; Jochen Seissler; Hans Hauner; Nikolaos Perakakis; Robert Wagner; Jürgen Machann; Fritz Schick; Andreas Peter; Rainer Lehmann; Cora Weigert; Jennifer Maurer; Hubert Preissl; Martin Heni; Julia Szendrödi; Stefan Kopf; Michele Solimena; Peter Schwarz; Matthias Blüher; Hans-Ulrich Häring; Martin Hrabé de Angelis; Annette Schürmann; Stefan Kabisch; Knut Mai; Andreas F H Pfeiffer; Stefan Bornstein; Michael Stumvoll; Michael Roden; Norbert Stefan; Andreas Fritsche; Andreas L Birkenfeld; Reiner Jumpertz von Schwartzenberg,1409,True,2025-10-01

Excess adiposity contributes to hepatic fat accumulation, systemic inflammation, insulin resistance, and activation of hepatic stellate cells. key mechanisms in liver injury and fibrogenesis. Diagnosis traditionally relied on liver biopsy, but noninvasive techniques, along with serum-based indices, are now commonly used. MASLD is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease, and endocrine disorders, particularly in obese individuals. Management is centered on weight reduction, which can reverse steatosis, resolve MASH, and regress fibrosis depending on the degree of weight loss. Recent therapeutic advances include the approval of resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist, and promising results from glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists. Bariatric surgery offers significant benefits in selected patients, improving liver histology and associated metabolic parameters. Despite these developments, no universally accepted pharmacotherapy exists for MASLD. Future directions include expanding access to diagnostic tools, validating novel biomarkers, and implementing public health strategies targeting obesity to prevent progression to end-stage liver disease.",2025,Dec,Journal of diabetes and metabolic disorders,Klaudia Nowak; Maria Paluch; Maja Cudzik; Klaudia Syska; Wiktoria Gawlikowska; Jakub Janczura,1740,True,2025-12-01

40510733,Key takeaways from the updated multidisciplinary European MASLD guidelines.,"The new European clinical practice guidelines from three scientific societies (European Association for the Study of the Liver, European Association for the Study of Diabetes and European Association for the Study of Obesity) on the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) provide detailed recommendations on diagnosis, risk stratification, monitoring strategies, treatment and prevention. Lifestyle interventions (eg, weight reduction, Mediterranean diet, exercise, alcohol abstinence) and the treatment of cardiometabolic risk factors continue to be the mainstay of treatment and prevention of the disease. Incretin mimetics that are approved to treat obesity and/or type 2 diabetes such as semaglutide and tirzepatide have benefits for ameliorating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Novel developments include adapted strategies for screening (case finding) using non-invasive tests (NITs) with a focus on detecting fibrosis or cirrhosis, risk-adjusted monitoring of MASLD by NITs as well as the recommendation to use, if locally approved, the thyroid hormone receptor β-agonist resmetirom in patients with non-cirrhotic MASH fibrosis (≥F2 stage).",2025,01,eGastroenterology,Paul Horn; Frank Tacke,1213,True,2025-01-01

41144456,"Exosomes combined with extra virgin olive oil reduces lipogenesis, oxidative stress, and inflammation in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease model.","In response to high-fat-diet, excessive lipid accumulation in the liver results in chronic damage and inflammation. Olive oil has been studied for its health beneficial effects in hyperlipidemia (mainly has lipids lowering and antioxidative potential) while mesenchymal stem cells derived exosomes (MSCs-Exo) are investigated mainly for their tissue regenerative and anti-inflammatory potential. In the present study we aimed to combine the beneficial effects of Extra Virgin Olive Oil (EVOO) and MSCs-Exo on a model of high-fat-diet induced Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD, which still lacks effective treatment protocols) and detect whether an improved response could be achieved from this combination. Sprague Dawley rats (n = 40) were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 8/group), control, hyperlipidemia (HL), HL+EVOO, HL + Exo and HL + Exo+EVOO. Our results show that better antihyperlipidemic effects were obtained in the combined group receiving Exo+EVOO treatment more than using EVOO or MSCs-Exo alone. This was achieved by improving plasma lipids profile, improving antioxidants stores and reducing lipid peroxidation, no change in liver function parameters which was confirmed also by the histopathological examination of the liver where a preserved normal liver architecture. To further elucidate the mechanisms involved, the gene expression levels of lipogenesis (SREBP-1c, ACC, FAS, GPAT3, SCD1, and FSP27), inflammation (IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-18, CCL20, and NF-κB), lipid peroxidation (CPT1A, ACOX1) and PPAR pathway (PPARα, PPARγ) were all normalized. This indicates that combined Exo+EVOO harnessed the benefits of both, and this was much better in treating hyperlipidemia and NAFLD and warrants prospects for approaches that could be adopted to treat NAFLD.",2025,01,PloS one,Bassam F Alowaiesh; Doaa Ibrahim; Ayman A Saleh; Haifa A S Alhaithloul; Abdulsalam A M Alkhaldi; Ahmed Abdelfattah-Hassan,1789,True,2025-01-01

Surgeons, endocrinologists, gastroenterologists, psychologists, pharmacologists, a general practitioner, a nutritionist, a nurse and a patients' representative acted as multi-disciplinary panel. This GL has been developed following the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. A systematic review and network meta-analysis was performed by a methodologic group. For each question, the panel identified potentially relevant outcomes, which were then rated for their impact on therapeutic choices. Only outcomes classified as ""critical"" and ""important"" were considered in the systematic review of evidence. Those classified as ""critical"" were considered for clinical practice recommendations. Consensus on the direction (for or against) and strength (strong or conditional) of recommendations was reached through a majority vote. The present GL provides recommendations about the role of both pharmacological and surgical treatment for the clinical management of the adult patient population with BMI > 27 kg/m The present GL is directed to all physicians addressing people with obesity-working in hospitals, territorial services or private practice-and to general practitioners and patients.

41024420,Managing obesity-related male infertility: insights from weight loss intervention.,"Obesity is a global health concern with major implications for male reproductive function. It disrupts endocrine and metabolic homeostasis, impairs semen quality, and is associated with reduced pregnancy and live birth rates. Hormonal imbalances, inflammation, and lipid stress are key contributors to these impairments. This mini-review summarizes current evidence on the impact of therapeutic interventions, including lifestyle modification, bariatric surgery, and pharmacological approaches such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, on male fertility outcomes. Lifestyle interventions, particularly moderate-intensity exercise and dietary improvements, are first-line therapies and should be routinely encouraged. Caloric restriction and Mediterranean-style diets rich in antioxidants have been associated with improved semen quality and hormonal balance. Bariatric surgery raises testosterone levels and may improve sperm quality and assisted reproduction outcomes in some men, but declines in sperm concentration and cases of postoperative azoospermia have also been reported. These findings underscore the importance of preoperative fertility counselling and consideration of sperm cryopreservation. GLP-1 receptor agonists promote weight loss and may improve sperm motility and hormonal markers; however, isolated cases of reversible impairment in sperm quality have been reported. Despite growing clinical use of these interventions, it remains unclear whether the observed benefits stem from weight loss itself or the specific treatment modalities. Longitudinal studies are needed to determine whether fertility improvements translate into higher conception rates. The reproductive safety of GLP-1 agonists in the preconception period also warrants further investigation. We recommend prioritizing pragmatic clinical trials with functional fertility endpoints, as well as mechanistic studies in well-characterized male obesity phenotypes and evaluation of offspring health. Ultimately, a shift is necessary from a narrow focus on weight loss to a broader emphasis on enhancing metabolic health. Personalized approaches tailored towards hormonal profiles, comorbidities, and fertility goals, supported by behavioural counselling and multidisciplinary care, are essential for advancing the treatment of obesity-related male infertility.",2025,Sep,"Human reproduction (Oxford, England)",Thairo A Pereira; Niral Thaker; André C Rubez; Victor F N Lima; Helen L Bernie; Sandro C Esteves,2361,True,2025-09-01
41152558,The 'Obesity First' approach: Redefining the future of healthcare.,"Obesity is a highly prevalent, chronic disease driven by food addiction and associated with increased premature mortality. Obesogenic environments promote unhealthy behavior, making weight management challenging. Until recently, effective pharmacological treatments were lacking. The introduction of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) represents a major breakthrough in obesity care, with the potential to transform treatment strategies. Despite their efficacy, high costs (as of 2025) limit accessibility, particularly in low and middle-income regions, where parallel, unregulated use is emerging. Obesity remains under-recognized as a primary medical condition, especially in populations prone to metabolic complications, including metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Gastroenterology has historically underestimated the role of GLP-1 RAs in the past. Moving forward, the choice between GLP-1 therapy and bariatric endoscopy/surgery will become a central research focus, with treatment failures in one modality already leading to crossover. GLP-1 RAs are expected to significantly impact obesity-related comorbidities, including hypertension, dyslipidaemia, type-2 diabetes, sleep apnea, MASLD and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). An ""Obesity First"" approach may reshape healthcare by addressing obesity as the primary topic cause for chronic disease. By 2035, the role of GLP-1 RAs as potential lifelong treatment will become clearer, with generic market expansion anticipated following patent expirations (China 2026; Europe 2031).",2025,Oct,Indian journal of gastroenterology : official journal of the Indian Society of Gastroenterology,Chris J J Mulder; Ahmed B Bayoumy; Azhar R Ansari,1586,True,2025-10-01
41131846,"A Pathophysiology-Informed, Negentropy-Oriented Strategy for Nanomedicine in MASLD.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a multifactorial chronic liver disorder driven by an ensemble of interrelated pathological processes, including insulin resistance, lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, immune dysregulation, gut microbiota imbalance, and hepatocyte injury-induced cell death. These overlapping mechanisms pose significant challenges for effective treatment, as conventional single-target therapies often fail to address the systemic complexity of the disease. Recent advances in functional nanomedicine have introduced promising avenues for MASLD intervention by enabling the development of nanoplatforms specifically engineered to interact with disease-specific pathophysiological features. These systems incorporate stimuli-responsive drug release, targeted hepatic accumulation, and intrinsic therapeutic activity, allowing for simultaneous modulation of multiple pathological pathways. This review presents a pathophysiology-informed framework for nanomedicine design in MASLD therapy. How diverse platforms are strategically tailored to regulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, modulate immune imbalance, restore insulin signaling, inhibit ferroptosis, and rebalance gut microbial dysbiosis is examined. Moreover, emerging approaches such as carrier-free, self-assembling systems and multifunctional yet intentionally minimalist architectures that enhance translational potential are highlighted. Together, these strategies exemplify a shift toward mechanism-driven, entropy-informed nanotherapeutics, wherein negentropy-oriented and leading-axis design principles offer a promising roadmap for restoring metabolic homeostasis in complex disease contexts such as MASLD.",2025,Oct,Advanced healthcare materials,Rui Mao; Meng Yu; Xiu-Ping Guo; Xiao-Lian Tian; Meng-Yu Zhao; Quan-Yong Yu; Gang Ren; Ming-Yu Pan; Ru Bai; Li-Ping Liu; Gui-Ling Li; Jian-Dong Jiang; Lu-Lu Wang,1737,True,2025-10-01

This work aims to clarify the pharmacological mechanism of chicory aqueous extract (CE) in improving MASLD from the perspective of gut-liver interaction. MASLD mice induced by a high-fat diet were employed as the in vivo model, while palmitic acid-induced AML12 cells served as the in vitro model. Combined qRT-PCR and Western blot to detect the expression of lipid metabolism-related genes/proteins. 16S rDNA sequencing and gut microbiota depletion experiments were conducted to elucidate the CE-gut microbiota interaction. UPLC-Q-TOF-MS was employed to analyze the chemical components of CE and plasma metabolite profiles. CE significantly inhibited body weight gain, improved hepatic lipid deposition, and down-regulated the expression of SREBP1 and SCD1 in MASLD mice. 16S rDNA sequencing and antibiotic-depleted microbiota experiments showed that CE significantly affected the diversity and community richness of gut microbiota, and its efficacy depended on the presence of gut microbiota. Metabolomics identified plasma taurodeoxycholic acid (TDCA) as a core metabolite of CE intervention, and its level was positively correlated with the abundance of microbial bile salt hydrolase (BSH). Furthermore, in vitro experiments confirmed that TDCA dose-dependently inhibited lipid accumulation in AML12 hyperlipidemic cells. CE exerts an anti-MASLD effect by remodeling the gut microbiota to promote TDCA synthesis, thereby suppressing SREBP1/SCD1 axis. This provides a theoretical foundation for developing gut-liver axis-targeted natural therapies against MASLD.",2025,Oct,Phytomedicine : international journal of phytotherapy and phytopharmacology,Haifeng Wang; Songlin Liu; Yonggang Chen; Weiwei Fang; Ying Cheng; Zhigang Zhang; Haiming Hu; Baifei Hu; Hongtao Liu,1785,True,2025-10-01

This retrospective study explored a panel of NITs for assessing response to semaglutide treatment in patients with MASH randomised in a phase 2b trial (NCT02970942). The present study was performed using the completer population (268 patients), defined as all patients who were randomised, remained on treatment throughout the trial, and had liver biopsy and NIT results at baseline and week 72.

41001493,Glucagon-like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists and Risk of Pulmonary Hypertension.,"Cardiometabolic disease is a leading cause of pulmonary hypertension (PH), a progressive condition that increases the risk of death and heart failure hospitalization. Preventive therapies are lacking, and Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are a promising intervention due to their broad cardiometabolic benefits. Therefore, this study was designed to determine whether GLP-1 RA exposure is associated with reduced risk for developing PH. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the Veterans Health Administration. Patients with diabetes and an echocardiogram without PH who initiated a GLP-1 RA or Dipeptidyl Peptidase 4 inhibitor (DPP-4i) between January 1, 2007 and December 31, 2021 were included in the study. We used the active comparator, new user design to emulate a pragmatic clinical trial and employed inverse probability weighting (IPW) to adjust for confounding. GLP-1 RA new users were compared to DPP-4i new users. Patients were followed from first prescription date (baseline) until PH diagnosis, death, or medication cessation (latest date April 30, 2022). The primary outcome was development of PH, defined by an echocardiographic estimated right ventricular systolic pressure of 35 mmHg or greater. We identified 4,109 GLP-1 RA users and 7,384 DPP-4i users without PH at baseline. In comparison to DPP4i users, GLP-1 RA users were younger (median [Q1-Q3], 69 [63-73] vs 70 [65-74]) and similar in sex distribution (94.6% vs 95.6% male). Unadjusted incidence rates of PH for GLP-1 RA compared to DPP-4i were 54.8 vs 69.7 cases per 1000 person-years. IPW achieved covariate balance between groups (all standardized mean differences <0.10). In Cox regression models on the IPW cohort, GLP-1 RA exposure compared to DPP-4i exposure was associated with a 28% reduced risk of developing PH (HR, 0.72; 95%CI 0.61-0.84). Reduced risk of PH associated with GLP-1 RA use was consistent across sensitivity and subgroup analyses, including when stratified by obesity and diabetes severity. GLP-1 RA use was associated with a reduced risk of developing PH.

While serum ferritin is recognized as a marker of liver injury and inflammation, its prognostic value for cirrhosis-related complications is not well established. We investigated whether serum ferritin levels could predict complications in cirrhotic patients. In this retrospective observational cohort study, which included both descriptive and analytical components, serum ferritin levels were measured in adult cirrhotic patients admitted to the gastroenterology department of a University Hospital Center between March 2017 and March 2024. The normal reference range was defined as 22–275 ng/mL for men and 4.63–204 ng/mL for women. Patients were monitored for the occurrence of complications over a one-year period. Statistical analyses were performed to assess the association between serum ferritin levels and complications, and to determine whether elevated ferritin was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes. The study included 200 cirrhotic patients (111 females and 89 males) with a mean age of 58,06 ± 15.21 years (range: 19–95). The most common etiologies were metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) (49.7%) and viral hepatitis (19%). Serum ferritin levels were significantly higher in decompensated patients compared to compensated patients (173 ± 295.22 ng/mL vs. 121.32 ± 251.98 ng/mL). During one-year follow-up, 68.5% of patients with elevated ferritin levels developed complications, compared to 27.7% of those with normal ferritin levels.

37367037,The Role of GLP1-RAs in Direct Modulation of Lipid Metabolism in Hepatic Tissue as Determined Using In Vitro Models of NAFLD.,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been shown to improve glucose and lipid homeostasis, promote weight loss, and reduce cardiovascular risk factors. They are a promising therapeutic option for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), the most common liver disease, associated with T2DM, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. GLP-1RAs have been approved for the treatment of T2DM and obesity, but not for NAFLD. Most recent clinical trials have suggested the importance of early pharmacologic intervention with GLP-1RAs in alleviating and limiting NAFLD, as well as highlighting the relative scarcity of in vitro studies on semaglutide, indicating the need for further research. However, extra-hepatic factors contribute to the GLP-1RA results of in vivo studies. Cell culture models of NAFLD can be helpful in eliminating extrahepatic effects on the alleviation of hepatic steatosis, modulation of lipid metabolism pathways, reduction of inflammation, and prevention of the progression of NAFLD to severe hepatic conditions.

Materials and Methods: L02 and THLE-2 cells were stimulated with free fatty acids (FFA) and transfected. Lipid accumulation was detected through Oil Red O staining, measurements of triglyceride and total cholesterol were taken, and the levels of tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, and IL-6 were assessed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The assessment of gene expression was conducted using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and Western blot techniques. The interplay between SNHG4 and miR-34b-5p/X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) was evaluated. Results: Free fatty acids downregulated SNHG4 and XIAP and upregulated miR-34b-5p in L02 and THLE-2 cells, leading to lipid metabolism disorder and inflammation. SNHG4 overexpression mitigated the lipid metabolism disorder and inflammation triggered by FFA, while this effect was suppressed by silencing XIAP.

40827263,Mechanism of Lipi Jiangzhuo Decoction in Improving Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis Through the PERK/PINK1/GPx4 Pathway.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is characterized primarily by hepatocyte lipoapoptosis and hepatic inflammation, frequently developing from overweight/obesity. To date, no specific therapeutics exist to reverse MASH. Although resmetirom has been approved in some regions, patients in many Asian countries, including China, still lack access to approved pharmacotherapy for MASH. Lipi Jiangzhuo decoction (LPJZD) is a promising traditional Chinese medicine formula for MASH. However, to date, there have been no comprehensive studies clarifying its potential mechanism of action. This study aims to elucidate the underlying mechanism of action of LPJZD in the treatment of MASH. A MASH mouse model was established by feeding a high-fat diet and subjecting them to fatigue protocols and cold stress for 12 weeks. After treating MASH mice with LPJZD, biochemical assays were conducted to assess the efficacy of LPJZD in alleviating the MASH symptoms. In addition, the in vitro effects of LPJZD on MASH were evaluated using L-02 cells. Specifically, we analyzed the effect of LPJZD on endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, mitophagy, and ferroptosis by Western blot analysis, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence staining, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In vivo, LPJZD effectively improved the inflammatory response, reduced body weight and blood lipid levels, improved liver function, reduced liver lipid droplet accumulation, and ameliorated the pathological status of MASH mice. In vitro, LPJZD effectively inhibited ferroptosis by reducing ferrous ions and reactive oxygen species levels, increasing GPx4 protein expression, elevating glutathione levels, and ameliorating mitochondrial swelling and matrix thinning. Simultaneously, LPJZD activated mitophagy by increasing PINK1 and Parkin protein expression, augmenting mitophagosome number, and restoring mitochondrial membrane potential. Additionally, LPJZD suppressed ER stress by decreasing PERK protein expression. Notably, activation of ER stress using a PERK activator attenuated LPJZD's effects on mitophagy activation and ferroptosis inhibition, inhibition of mitophagy via a PINK1 inhibitor diminished LPJZD's anti-ferroptotic effect, and administration of a GPx4 inhibitor reduced LPJZD's suppression of ferroptosis. Therefore, these results demonstrate that LPJZD ameliorates MASH by regulating the PERK/PINK1/GPx4 pathway. LPJZD can improve MASH by regulating ER stress-mitophagy -ferroptosis axis in liver cells. The role of LPJZD in anti-inflammatory therapy provides new insights for the clinical prevention and treatment of MASH.",2025,01,Journal of inflammation research,Linlin Pan; Juhai Liu; Guowei Pang; Guirong Liu; Yuan Tian,2624,True,2025-01-01
39110384,Resmetirom and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis: Perspectives on Multidisciplinary Management from Global Healthcare Professionals.,"The approval of resmetirom brings great hope to patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The purpose of this review is to explore its impact on the global health environment. The implementation of multidisciplinary management MASH is proposed. Resmetirom has benefits in the treatment of MASH, and its safety and effectiveness have been studied. The adverse events (AEs) need to be noticed. To improve patient outcomes, a multimodal approach with medication such as resmetirom, combined with metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS) and lifestyle interventions can be conducted. MASH, a liver disease linked with obesity, is a challenging global healthcare burden compounded by the absence of any approved pharmacotherapy. The recent conditional approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States of resmetirom, an oral, liver-directed, thyroid hormone receptor beta-selective agonist, marks a significant milestone, offering a treatment option for adults with non-cirrhotic MASH and who have moderate to advanced liver fibrosis. This narrative review discusses the efficacy and safety of resmetirom and its role in the therapeutic landscape of MASH treatment. Despite the promising hepatoprotective effect of resmetirom on histological liver endpoints, its use need further research, particularly regarding ethnic differences, effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, production scalability, social acceptance and accessibility. In addition, integrating resmetirom with other multidisciplinary therapeutic approaches, including lifestyle changes and MBS, might further improve clinical liver-related and cardiometabolic outcomes of individuals with MASH. This review highlights the importance of a comprehensive treatment strategy, supporting continued innovation and collaborative research to refine treatment guidelines and consensus for managing MASH, thereby improving clinical patient outcomes in the growing global epidemic of MASH. Studies done to date have been relatively short and ongoing, the course of the disease is highly variable, the conditions of various patients vary, and given this complex clinical phenotype, it may take many years of clinical trials to show long-term benefits.",2024,Dec,Current obesity reports,Kahei Au; Ming-Hua Zheng; Wei-Jei Lee; Omar M Ghanem; Kamal Mahawar; Asim Shabbir; Carel W le Roux; Giovanni Targher; Christopher D Byrne; Yusuf Yilmaz; Luca Valenti; Giada Sebastiani; Sombat Treeprasertsuk; Hannah Xiaoyan Hui; Nasser Sakran; Manoel Galvao Neto; Mohammad Kermansaravi; Lilian Kow; Yosuke Seki; Kwang Wei Tham; Jerry Dang; Ricardo V Cohen; Christine Stier; Salman AlSabah; Rodolfo J Oviedo; Sonja Chiappetta; Chetan Parmar; Wah Yang,2246,True,2024-12-01
41001395,GLP-1 receptor agonist increase retained gastric contents on EGD and same-day colonoscopy reduces this risk.,"With the rise in glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) medication usage for Type 2 diabetes mellitus and weight loss, concerns have been raised regarding safety and primary aspiration risk when undergoing anesthesia procedures. Given the paucity of evidence, there is concern whether patients on GLP-1RA are at higher risk of retained gastric contents and subsequent adverse outcomes during routine esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD). This study aims to investigate whether patients on GLP-1RA are at higher risk of retained gastric contents during routine EGD. In this retrospective study, we examined 1,368 adult patients who underwent EGDs in the outpatient setting at a tertiary care center. A multivariable analysis was conducted to predict the presence of retained gastric contents on EGD, with the primary predictor being GLP-1RA use. Covariates thought to contribute to delayed gastric emptying were used as secondary predictors. Retained gastric contents were seen in 18 out of 128 cases in the GLP-1RA users (14.1%), which was statistically significant when compared to 45 out of the 1,156 non-users (3.8%) ( Our results show an increase in retained gastric contents in GLP-1RA users undergoing EGD. Other mitigating factors and whether the increase results in aspiration complications should be further studied.",2025,01,Frontiers in medicine,Dirin Ukwade; Luis J Hernandez; Zeel Modi; Hasan S Raza; Michael Siegel; Dexter Nwachukwu; Paya Sarraf; Abdullah Memon; Marya Booth; Karen Cooper; Brian R Boulay; Ece A Mutlu,1334,True,2025-01-01

40262132,AI-based phenotyping of hepatic fiber morphology to inform molecular alterations in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Hepatic fiber morphology may significantly enhance our understanding of molecular alterations in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We aimed to comprehensively characterize hepatic fiber morphological phenotypes in MASLD and their associated molecular alterations using multilayer omics analyses. To quantify the morphological phenotypes of hepatic fibers, the artificial intelligence-based FibroNest algorithm (PharmaNest) was applied to 94 MASLD-affected liver biopsies, among which 12 (13%) had concurrent HCC. FibroNest identified 327 fiber phenotypes that were summarized into 8 major principal components, named FibroPC1-8. Next, molecular alterations captured by morphological fiber phenotypes were evaluated by comparison with genome-wide transcriptomics of paired liver samples. Pathway analyses revealed that FibroPCs more sensitively captured MASLD-related molecular alterations, such as upregulation of interleukin-6 and susceptibility to resmetirom, compared with the histological fibrosis stage. Among them, FibroPC4, which reflects reticular fibers, was associated with a gene signature predictive of incident HCC from MASLD. Furthermore, we used a spatial single-cell transcriptome, CosMx, to reveal the cell-cell interactions driving MASLD pathogenesis, as captured by FibroPC4. CosMx revealed that the FibroPC4-rich microenvironment contains HCC-promoting HSCs located adjacent to periportal endothelial cells. Neighboring cell analyses suggested that the HCC-promoting phenotype of HSCs was acquired by insulin growth factor-binding protein 7 secreted from senescent periportal endothelial cells. Consistently, in vitro experiments showed that insulin growth factor-binding protein 7 transformed HSCs into an HCC-promoting phenotype. Hepatic morphological fiber phenotyping can reveal the disease progression and underlying mechanisms of MASLD.",2025,Apr,"Hepatology (Baltimore, Md.)",Naoto Fujiwara; Yuki Matsushita; Mina Tempaku; Yutaro Tachi; Genki Kimura; Kiyora Izuoka; Yuki Hayata; Satoshi Kawamura; Akiko Eguchi; Takuma Nakatsuka; Masaya Sato; Atsushi Ono; Eisuke Murakami; Masataka Tsuge; Shiro Oka; Akinobu Hayashi; Yoshifumi Hirokawa; Masatoshi Watanabe; Neehar D Parikh; Amit G Singal; Jorge A Marrero; Yujin Hoshida; Shugo Mizuno; Ryosuke Tateishi; Kazuhiko Koike; Mitsuhiro Fujishiro; Hayato Nakagawa,1895,True,2025-04-01
41116319,Assessing the therapeutic potential of Tirzepatide in modulating inflammatory responses and mitigating acute pancreatitis.,"Acute pancreatitis (AP) is a severe inflammation of the pancreas, marked by elevated enzyme levels, cellular inflammation, and necrosis. Recent studies emphasize the critical role of inflammation in AP progression. Tirzepatide, a multi-target agonist of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) receptors, has demonstrated notable anti-inflammatory and metabolic benefits. This study explores the therapeutic potential of Tirzepatide in pancreatitis induced by L-arginine in rats, focusing on enzymatic markers, cytokine profiles, oxidative stress, and histological outcomes. Over 27 days, rats were distributed into Control, Tirzepatide, L-Arginine, and L-Arginine + Tirzepatide groups, with the latter receiving L-Arginine to induce pancreatitis followed by Tirzepatide administration. L-Arginine significantly elevated serum amylase, lipase, and inflammatory mediators (IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10), alongside oxidative stress markers and histopathological deterioration. Conversely, the L-Arginine + Tirzepatide group exhibited reduced lipase and IL-6 levels, suppressed reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, and enhanced anti-inflammatory cytokines IL-4 and IL-10. Histopathological analysis revealed reduced necrosis and tissue damage in the L-Arginine + Tirzepatide group compared to the L-Arginine group, indicating Tirzepatide's possible protective effects. Immunofluorescence studies further demonstrated increased p-Akt expression, supporting the role of Tirzepatide in cellular repair and recovery. These findings highlight Tirzepatide's ability to mitigate pancreatic damage through antioxidant and anti-inflammatory mechanisms, underscoring its potential as a pharmacological agent for acute pancreatitis.",2025,Oct,Animal models and experimental medicine,Razan Alawaji; Mohamed S Abdel-Bakky; Hussein M Ali; Miad A Aljuhani; Abdulaziz Arif A Alshammari; Hashim K Kamal; Maamoun M K Khoja; Kholoud Alsehemi; Mennatallah A Korani; Eman S Said,1764,True,2025-10-01
41130087,Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and new onset diabetes mellitus after liver transplantation.,"After Liver Transplantation (LT), patients often gain weight and develop metabolic comorbidities. This study aimed to assess the prevalence and severity of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) after LT and the incidence of New-Onset Diabetes After LT (NODALT). Post-LT patients were recruited from an outpatient clinic. Hepatic ultrasound and 2D shear-wave elastography were performed. A total of 142 patients were included, 63 % male with median age 60 (Interquartile Range [IQR] 47‒68 years). Median follow-up time post-LT was 137 (IQR 77‒205 months). MASLD was diagnosed in 26 %. Patients with MASLD exhibited a higher prevalence of central obesity (92 % vs. 68 %, p = 0.006), diabetes (65 % vs. 38 %, p = 0.005), hypertriglyceridemia (51 % vs. 26 %, p = 0.008), and metabolic syndrome (69 % vs. 41 %, p = 0.006) compared to those without MASLD. MASLD was independently associated with hypertriglyceridemia (Odds Ratio [OR = 2.80], 95 % Confidence Interval [95 % CI 1.22‒6.43], p = 0.015) and post-LT diabetes (OR = 2.65, 95 % CI 1.15‒6.10, p = 0.022). NODALT occurred in 36 % and was independently associated with older age (OR = 1.05, 95 % CI 1.01‒1.08, p = 0.01), time from LT (OR = 1.01, 95 % CI 1.003‒1.016, p = 0.006), body mass index (OR = 1.12, 95 % CI 1.02‒1.22, p = 0.02) and MASLD (OR = 2.99, 95 % CI 1.13‒7.92, p = 0.028). Advanced fibrosis occurred in 9 % of MASLD patients, which was similar from patients without MASLD. After LT, the prevalence of MASLD was 26 % ant the incidence of NODALT was 36 %. MASLD was associated with diabetes and hypertriglyceridemia, while NODALT was linked to older age, longer follow-up post-LT and MASLD.

41173687,Finite-time differential games in missile guidance: Achieving motion camouflage and robust cooperative encirclement guidance.,"In this article, a three-dimensional (3D) cooperative interception guidance strategy is proposed, in which multiple missiles encircle a maneuvering target within a leader-follower framework. A cooperative encirclement guidance law is developed by integrating Motion Camouflage (MC) theory, Finite-Time Differential Game (FTDG) theory, and Adaptive Time-Varying Sliding Mode Control (ATVMSMC). The missile closest to the target is designated as the leader. An FTDG-based guidance strategy is formulated using MC theory and differential game analysis to minimize the target's probability of escape. The finite-time Nash equilibrium solution is derived through a state-dependent differential Riccati equation framework, ensuring that the leader achieves motion camouflage. In scenarios where actuator failures may occur in the followers, a robust cooperative encirclement guidance law is designed based on the leader's remaining interception time. The ATVMSMC law guarantees that all followers complete the encirclement at the moment of the leader's interception. The stability of the game-based guidance strategy is verified using Lyapunov theory. Numerical simulations under multiple scenarios demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and advantages of the proposed method for cooperative encirclement in pursuit-evasion engagements.",2025,Oct,ISA transactions,Yiao Zhan; Linwei Wang; Di Zhou,1335,True,2025-10-01
40549581,"Medications for Weight Loss and MASLD: A National Survey of Hepatology and Gastroenterology Provider Practices, Attitudes, and Knowledge Before Resmetirom.","Our aim was to perform a national survey of provider attitudes, practices, and knowledge regarding weight loss and MASLD medications in patients with MASLD. While weight loss is a cornerstone in the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), FDA-approved medications for weight loss remain underutilized. We conducted a survey before resmetirom approval of hepatology and gastroenterology providers practicing in 44 states. Surveys were sent to 747 providers with 304 complete responses (41%), of whom 260 (86%) work at a liver transplant center. While nearly all respondents (96%) believed that weight loss medications could benefit patients with MASLD, 77% have never/rarely prescribed them due to low comfort (81%). Among weight loss medication prescribers, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists were preferred (66%). In contrast, 63% had prescribed off-label medications for MASLD in the past 12 months, most commonly vitamin E (30%) and GLP-1 receptor agonists (25%). The top reported barriers to prescribing weight loss medications were lack of training/unfamiliarity, cost/insurance coverage, and side-effects, which may be explained by low formal obesity education and lack of knowledge (only 33% of FDA-approved medications for weight loss were correctly identified by >50% of providers). Overall, there was reasonable provider-reported adherence to the 2023 AASLD practice guidance for MASLD. This nationwide survey of hepatology and gastroenterology providers before resmetirom demonstrates that while off-label prescribing for MASLD was common, weight loss medication prescription rates remain very low due to low comfort possibly from insufficient education despite strong beliefs that they can benefit patients with MASLD.",2025,Jun,Journal of clinical gastroenterology,Gene Y Im; Amon Asgharpour; Elizabeth S Aby; Jonathan G Stine; Jessica L Mellinger; Jay Luther; Manhal Izzy; Lamia Haque; Brian T Lee; Thomas G Cotter; Courtney B Sherman; Loretta L Jophlin; Aparna Goel; John Rice; Shaun Chandna; Blanca Lizaola-Mayo; Po-Hung Chen; Ashwani K Singal; Meena B Bansal,1786,True,2025-06-01
41130867,Contemporary management of advanced chronic kidney disease: An evidence-based review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major contributor to global morbidity and mortality, traditionally managed through renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibition and supportive care. Recent therapeutic advances have transformed this landscape, offering targeted interventions that modify disease progression and improve cardiovascular and renal outcomes. This review summarizes emerging treatments across key domains of CKD management. Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists have demonstrated robust cardiorenal benefits, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). SGLT2 inhibitors are now widely used in CKD and heart failure, including among non-diabetic populations. GLP-1 receptor agonists are approved for T2DM and cardiovascular risk reduction, with recent expansion to CKD in T2DM. Nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs), particularly finerenone, provide additional cardiorenal protection with a lower risk of hyperkalemia than traditional steroidal agents. In autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), tolvaptan remains the only approved disease-modifying therapy, with clinical trials and real-world data supporting its efficacy across a range of disease stages. Emerging regenerative strategies, including mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) therapy and xenotransplantation using genetically modified pig kidneys, have shown early promise in preclinical models and limited human studies. While further research is needed to optimize patient selection and long-term outcomes, these approaches represent important future directions in nephrology. Together, these developments mark a shift toward mechanism-based, precision therapies in CKD care. Internal medicine clinicians are pivotal in identifying appropriate candidates for these treatments and integrating evolving evidence into practice to improve patient outcomes.",2025,Oct,European journal of internal medicine,Lyle W Baker; Cene Ovincy; Levon Souvalian; LaTonya J Hickson; Fouad T Chebib,1939,True,2025-10-01
41089284,Positive correlations between TyG and TyG-BMI indices and the risk of NAFLD and degree of liver fibrosis in patients undergoing PCI.,"We aim to investigate the association between TyG(Triglyceride-Glucose index) and TyG-BMI(Triglyceride-Glucose-Body Mass Index) indices and the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), an area where their predictive value is currently unclear, despite their established link to insulin resistance, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. In this cross-sectional study, 776 patients who underwent coronary angiography and PCI were categorized into NAFLD+PCI and PCI groups based on abdominal ultrasound. They were further classified by TyG and TyG-BMI indices. Continuous variables were compared using ANOVA, Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney, or t-tests, while categorical variables were analyzed with χ² or Fisher exact tests. Logistic regression identified independent factors for NAFLD in PCI patients. ROC curves evaluated the predictive efficacy of TyG and TyG-BMI for NAFLD. Linear correlation and multiple linear regression assessed relationships among NAFLD fibrosis score (NFS), TyG, and TyG-BMI. Among 776 patients, NAFLD was detected in 305. After adjusting for age, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, sex, and cardiovascular disease, multivariate logistic regression showed the TyG index was a significant risk factor for NAFLD in PCI patients (OR = 2.04; 95% CI, 1.62-2.55; P < 0.001). Similarly, the TyG-BMI index, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL cholesterol, fasting blood glucose, and BMI were associated with increased NAFLD risk. Each unit increase in the TyG index raised the NAFLD risk by 2.63-fold (OR = 2.63; 95% CI, 1.78-3.8; P<0.001), and each unit increase in the TyG-BMI index by 3.80-fold (OR = 3.80; 95% CI, 2.55-5.68; P < 0.001). Multivariate linear regression indicated that in the PCI-NAFLD group, each unit increase in the TyG index increased the NFS value by 0.247 (β = 0.247; 95% CI, 0.19-0.45; P < 0.001), and each unit increase in the TyG-BMI index increased the NFS value by 0.344 (β = 0.344; 95% CI, 0.28-0.59; P < 0.001). The TyG index and TyG-BMI were positively associated with the risk of NAFLD in patients treated with PCI, reflecting the severity of liver fibrosis.",2025,01,Frontiers in endocrinology,Yingxiang Chen; Che Wang; Xiaoyu Du; Xiaotong Sun; Wenjuan Song; Chengzhi Lu,2184,True,2025-01-01
39155764,Budget impact of resmetirom for the treatment of adults with non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (consistent with stages F2 to F3 fibrosis).,"This study assessed the budget impact of resmetirom as a treatment for adults with non-cirrhotic non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with moderate-to-advanced liver fibrosis and estimated total costs for a hypothetical private payer in the United States. A three-year budget impact analysis based on an open cohort state transition model was developed for a hypothetical one-million-member private health plan. The comparator was Standard of Care (SOC), defined as routine care for non-cirrhotic NASH patients with moderate-to-advanced liver fibrosis. Each year, the number of resmetirom treatment-eligible patients was estimated through prevalent, incident, and diagnostic rate estimates. Costs included resources incurred by the medical and pharmacy benefits of private payers, including resmetirom drug acquisition costs, diagnosis and monitoring, other medical and other prescription costs stratified by disease progression status (i.e. non-cirrhotic vs. cirrhotic/advanced liver diseases). Resmetirom adverse event management costs were included in sensitivity analysis. Drug costs were estimated based on the average wholesale acquisition cost as of March 2024. Other costs were based on published sources and inflated to 2023 US dollars. Budget impact outcomes were presented in aggregate, net, and on a per-member per-month (PMPM) basis. Compared with a scenario without resmetirom, the introduction of resmetirom yielded results ranging from 50 to 238 treated patients, net budget impact of $2.2 to $9.5 million, and PMPM from $0.19 to $0.80 over years one and three. Net costs excluding resmetirom declined over time. In sensitivity analyses, results were most sensitive to diagnostic and epidemiologic inputs. Market shares are based on internal forecasts, a short time horizon, average treatment effects, and other limitations common to BIMs. The adoption of resmetirom on the formulary for the treatment of non-cirrhotic NASH with moderate-to-advanced liver fibrosis resulted in a moderate increase in budget impact with declining costs related to NASH progression. Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a serious liver disease that can lead to significant liver damage, other health complications, and increased healthcare costs. As the disease progresses, patients typically experience worsening health outcomes. Until recently, there were no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved treatments for NASH in the United States. However, in March 2024, the FDA approved REZDIFFRA, a new drug specifically designed to treat NASH patients with moderate-to-advanced liver fibrosis (i.e. NASH with moderate-to-advanced scarring of the liver). Clinical trials have shown that REZDIFFRA can improve health outcomes in these patients.To identify patients who could benefit from REZDIFFRA and to estimate the associated costs, we developed a budget impact model. In this study, we detail the development of this model and present its findings. Our analysis revealed that, while REZDIFFRA is associated with higher overall costs, primarily due to the price of the drug itself, there are potential cost savings when considering the drug’s ability to slow disease progression.",2024,01,Journal of medical economics,Jesse Fishman; Yestle Kim; Hélène Parisé; Eric Bercaw; Zachary Smith,3184,True,2024-01-01
40331190,Targeting fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-21: a promising strategy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease treatment.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatitic liver disease (MASLD) is the predominant chronic liver disease, with its incidence increasing year by year. It has emerged as the most rapidly increasing contributor to liver-related mortality worldwide and is becoming a principal cause of end-stage liver disorders, primarily cancer of the liver and liver transplantation, hence putting a substantial economic burden on public health. The approval of Resmetirom signifies significant advancement in the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH); nonetheless, the heterogeneity of MASLD renders it challenging for a single medication to address the requirements of all patients. Consequently, it is essential to formulate varied therapeutic approaches for distinct pathogenic causes and phases of disease. Fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21), a member of the fibroblast growth factor family, plays a positive and protective role in MASLD. It attenuates hepatic steatosis and lipotoxicity, ameliorates insulin resistance (IR), reduces oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, and inflammation, as well as possesses anti-fibrotic effects. As a result, FGF21 has the potential to treat MASLD. In this review, we will address the possible mechanisms of FGF21 therapy for MASLD to facilitate the development of clinical therapies targeting FGF21 for MASLD.",2025,01,Frontiers in pharmacology,Xinyue Cui; Quanhao Sun; Haiqiang Wang,1384,True,2025-01-01

The current study explored the mechanistic association between high dietary cholesterol, MASLD, and PDAC. Importantly, we aimed to evaluate the effect of a multi-strain probiotic formulation on hypercholesterolemia-driven MASLD and PDAC. In this study, wild-type (C57BL/6) and KC (Pdx-1 Cre; Kras HCCD induced non-obese MASLD and PDAC progression, which was eased upon probiotics intervention. Importantly, it also increased the survival of the HCCD-fed KC mice. The probiotic intervention protected against HCCD-induced leaky gut, gut microbiota translocation, and inflammatory milieu in different tissues. Interestingly, HCCD significantly increased the population of pro-inflammatory/pro-tumorigenic peritoneal macrophages (PM), which got normalized upon probiotic administration. The probiotic formulation LR+F15 significantly suppressed HCCD-induced MASLD and PDAC progression partly through suppressing leaky gut and normalizing PMs' inflammatory properties. These findings encourage evaluation of the potential benefits of this probiotic consortium in combination with the existing therapies against PDAC in the future.",2025,Oct,Cellular and molecular gastroenterology and hepatology,Deepti Parida; Swayambara Mishra; Amlan Priyadarshee Mohapatra; Manisha Sethi; Kirti Ranjan Das; Salona Kar; Voddu Suresh; Shrikrishna Jayaram Bhagat; Amruta Mohapatra; Supriya Halder; Shantibhusan Senapati,1377,True,2025-10-01
41066072,Real-World Effectiveness of Tirzepatide versus Semaglutide on HbA1c and Weight in Patients with Type 2 Diabetes.,"To evaluate real-world hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and weight change in adults initiating treatment with tirzepatide (dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist [GLP-1 RA]) or injectable semaglutide (GLP-1 RA) indicated for type 2 diabetes (T2D) management. This retrospective analysis utilized the Healthcare Integrated Research Database® to identify adults with T2D starting tirzepatide or injectable semaglutide between May 13, 2022 and May 29, 2023. GLP-1 RA naïve and non-naïve cohorts were identified based on the history of GLP-1 RA use within ≤ 6 months of initiation. Propensity score matching balanced 6-month baseline characteristics between groups. HbA1c and weight changes were assessed from initiation to 12 months for matched patients with HbA1c and weight data at both time points. Both matched naïve cohorts were comprised of 10,702 patients (tirzepatide: 1399 with HbA1c data and 454 with weight data; semaglutide: 1173 with HbA1c data and 432 with weight data). Mean baseline HbA1c and weight were 7.8% and 112.4 kg, respectively, for the tirzepatide group and 7.8% and 110.7 kg for the semaglutide group. Both matched non-naïve cohorts were comprised of 5577 patients (tirzepatide: 792 with HbA1c data and 296 with weight data; semaglutide: 738 with HbA1c data and 224 with weight data). Mean baseline HbA1c and weight were 7.7% and 112.5 kg for tirzepatide, and 7.9% and 108.5 kg for semaglutide. Tirzepatide was associated with greater mean reductions in HbA1c (naïve: - 1.3% vs. - 0.9%; non-naïve: - 0.9% vs. - 0.6%; p < 0.001) and weight (naïve: - 10.2 kg vs. - 6.1 kg; non-naïve: - 7.9 kg vs. - 3.7 kg; p < 0.001) than semaglutide. Patients with T2D starting tirzepatide had greater HbA1c and weight reductions at 12 months post-initiation than those on injectable semaglutide, regardless of previous GLP-1 RA use, consistent with previous clinical trial results. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a serious health issue, often linked to other health conditions like obesity. There is little information on the real-world effects of tirzepatide (a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist [GLP-1]) compared to semaglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist only) in helping people with type 2 diabetes improve their blood sugar control (HbA1c) and lose weight. This study used real-world data from the Healthcare Integrated Research Database (HIRD®), including adults with T2D who initiated either tirzepatide (Mounjaro®) or semaglutide (Ozempic®). Patients with and without past use of GLP-1 receptor agonists were looked at separately. HbA1c and weight were measured at the start of treatment (baseline) and again after 12 months. After 12 months, people who initiated tirzepatide achieved lower HbA1c levels and lost more weight than those who initiated semaglutide. Among GLP-1 naïve patients, tirzepatide users reduced their HbA1c by 1.3% and lost 10.2 kg, while semaglutide users reduced their HbA1c by 0.9% and lost 6.1 kg, on average. Tirzepatide was also more effective at reducing HbA1c and weight than semaglutide among people with prior GLP-1 receptor agonist use. Clinical trials show how well and how safely medicines work in controlled settings. Once available for use in routine medical practice, real-world studies give additional information about how the medicines work in everyday medical care. This analysis compares two approved medicines used to treat T2D in real life and may help doctors and health leaders make decisions to improve care for people with this condition.",2025,Nov,"Diabetes therapy : research, treatment and education of diabetes and related disorders",Meredith M Hoog; Carlos Vallarino; Juan M Maldonado; Michael Grabner; Chia-Chen Teng; Kendra Terrell; Emma L Richard,3603,True,2025-11-01
41076573,Emerging concepts in the diagnosis and management of metabolically associated steatotic liver disease.,"Given the global rise of MASLD, which impacts approximately one-third of the population, there is a need for earlier diagnosis and effective treatment strategies to avoid long-term hepatic cardiovascular and renal complications. This review summarizes the recent advances in noninvasive diagnosis and new pharmacological agents approved for MASLD. The main step forward in diagnostics is a step away from invasive biopsy and emphasis on noninvasive methods including serum biomarkers (e.g. CK-18 and FGF21), imaging (e.g. MRI-PDFF and US-FLI), combination of the two and use of artificial intelligence and machine learning models, for early detection and risk stratification of MASLD and MASH. Multiomics approaches, such as metabolomics and lipidomics, reveal disease-specific signatures, and may help with phenotypic classification of MASLD. Personalized management for MASLD include gut microbiota modulation and point-of-care devices for rapid diagnosis. Novel therapies include THR β agonists, GLP-1/dual GLP-1/GIP agonists, FXR agonists and FGF analogues, which show promise in reducing hepatic fat and fibrosis. These findings enable earlier MASLD diagnosis and tailored interventions, improving clinical outcomes in primary care and resource-limited settings. Future research should focus on validating cost-effective tools, and developing combination therapies to address the multifaceted nature of MASLD.",2025,Dec,"Current opinion in endocrinology, diabetes, and obesity",Sambit Das; Khushboo Agarwal; Nitin Kapoor; Om J Lakhani; Arundhati Das Gupta,1415,True,2025-12-01
41088597,The impact of BMI on the causal relationship between NAFLD and OA: A 2-sample Mendelian randomization study exploring gene interactions and metabolic pathways.,"This study aims to investigate the role of body mass index (BMI) in modulating the causal relationship between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and osteoarthritis (OA), focusing on the impact of BMI on metabolic pathways. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analysis was conducted using genome-wide association study data to assess how BMI affects the relationship between NAFLD and OA. The study was divided into 3 BMI groups: BMI < 25, BMI 25 to 30, and BMI > 30. Additionally, gene expression differences between damaged and undamaged cartilage samples from individuals in these BMI categories were validated through qPCR. Mendelian randomization analysis revealed a negative association between NAFLD and OA in individuals with BMI < 25 (OR: 0.7215, 95% CI [0.5214-0.9984], P = .048), while a positive association was found in individuals with BMI > 30 (OR: 1.0956, 95% CI [1.0294-1.1661], P = .0029). Gene expression analysis showed significant downregulation of ULK3 in damaged cartilage in the BMI < 25 group, while ACER3, RAB14, ZNF600, and ADARB1 exhibited significant upregulation in the BMI > 30 group. Our findings highlight the critical role of BMI in the relationship between NAFLD and OA. In the low BMI group, enhanced autophagy and lower systemic inflammation may protect joint health, while obesity-related metabolic dysfunction and chronic low-grade inflammation contribute to OA progression in the high BMI group. The differential expression of ULK3, ACER3, RAB14, ZNF600, and ADARB1 genes across BMI categories provides potential clinical therapeutic targets for BMI-specific interventions in NAFLD and OA.",2025,Oct,Medicine,Shengyuan Yu; Yishu Liu; Bing Xue; Xi Zhang; Ming Gao; Daifeng Lu,1635,True,2025-10-01

One hundred and thirty-one adult patients with metabolic syndrome were included in the study. Grey scale ultrasound of liver and pancreas was performed to evaluate grades of hepatic steatosis (HS) and pancreatic steatosis (PS) respectively. Subsequently, 2D-SWE was performed to obtain liver and pancreatic stiffness in kPa and m/s. Grades of HS and PS were correlated with body mass index (BMI), biochemical parameters, hepatic and pancreatic stiffness values. Moderate correlation was found between HS grade and BMI, while the correlation of PS grade with BMI was poor. On SWE, hepatic and pancreatic stiffness showed strong and moderate correlation with BMI, respectively. Among biochemical parameters, triglycerides showed highest correlation with HS grade and hepatic stiffness, while fasting blood glucose showed highest correlation with PS grade and pancreatic stiffness. The stiffness values of both organs showed statistically significant difference in participant groups with and without steatosis (p < 0.001). Mean hepatic and pancreatic stiffness values showed strong positive correlation with grade of HS (Ʈ=0.84) and PS (Ʈ=0.82), respectively. Metabolic syndrome is associated with both hepatic and pancreatic steatosis with consequent increase in hepatic and pancreatic stiffness values respectively. These values show positive correlation with the grade of steatosis. 2D-SWE along with biochemical parameters, can be utilized in the screening of MS patients for early detection and surveillance of further disease progression to prevent potential complications.",2025,Oct,Abdominal radiology (New York),Chitty Suvarna Duggireddy; Rashmi Dixit; Sapna Singh; Sandeep Garg; Sanjeev Sachdeva,1838,True,2025-10-01

41129073,The Influence of GLP-1 Agonists on Human Mesenchymal Stem Cells: A Systematic Review.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists, originally developed for managing type 2 diabetes, have gained attention for their weight-reducing and broader biological effects. Among these, their influence on human mesenchymal stem cells remains underexplored, despite the critical role of mesenchymal stem cells in tissue regeneration and secretion of bioactive factors. This systematic review followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines to identify and evaluate in vitro studies investigating the effects of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and their analogues on human mesenchymal stem cell functions, including proliferation, differentiation, signaling, apoptosis, and tissue-specific applications. Risk of bias was assessed using an adapted Quality Assessment Tool for In Vitro Studies (QUIN) tool. Thirty-eight eligible studies were identified. Glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonist, like native glucagon-like peptide-1, Exendin-4, and Liraglutide, exert context-, dose-, and timing-dependent effects on human mesenchymal stem cells. They modulate proliferation and overall promote osteogenesis while inhibiting adipogenesis. Key pathways, including Wnt/β-catenin, bone morphogenetic protein 2/Smad, phosphoinositide 3-kinase/Akt and protein kinase A, play a role in this. Furthermore, these agents modulate inflammation, reduce apoptosis, and improve stem cell functions even under diabetic or inflammatory conditions. Exendin-4 facilitated tenogenic and insulin-producing cell differentiation, particularly in engineered scaffolds or genetically engineered human mesenchymal stem cells. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists modulate key pathways in human mesenchymal stem cells to influence survival, differentiation, and metabolic function, suggesting promising therapeutic potential beyond glycemic control.

PubMed, Embase, Cochrane CENTRAL, and ClinicalTrials.gov were searched through July 2025 for randomized controlled trials with ≥24 weeks of follow-up in patients with T2DM and CKD. Outcomes included composite renal outcome, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR). A network meta-analysis was conducted, and the certainty of evidence was assessed with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation used to evaluate evidence certainty (GRADE). Twenty RCTs enrolling 80,670 participants were included. Compared with placebo, several agents significantly reduced composite renal outcomes, with dapagliflozin 10 mg showing the greatest efficacy (OR 0.55, 95% CI 0.42-0.72; high-certainty evidence), followed by canagliflozin, empagliflozin, efpeglenatide, sotagliflozin 400 mg, semaglutide, and dulaglutide 1.5 mg. Canagliflozin 100-300 mg significantly reduced UACR, whereas dapagliflozin had no effect. None of the novel antidiabetic agents significantly altered eGFR. Certainty of evidence ranged from high for placebo-controlled comparisons to low or very low for indirect estimates. In patients with T2DM and CKD, SGLT2 inhibitors provide the most consistent renal protection, while GLP-1 receptor agonists offer additional but variable benefits. Dapagliflozin showed the greatest efficacy, and canagliflozin most strongly reduced albuminuria, highlighting meaningful heterogeneity across agents. DPP-4 inhibitors conferred no renal benefit. Overall, evidence from placebo-controlled trials was robust, whereas certainty was lower for indirect estimates, highlighting the need for drug-specific evaluation in clinical practice.",2025,Oct,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Rong Lin; Chia-Li Hsu; Ming-Chieh Shih; Kuo-Liong Chien; Hon-Yen Wu,1979,True,2025-10-01

Although the update of the MASLD practice guidelines and the approval of Resmetirom have brought new progress in the prevention and treatment of MASLD, this disease still has not received sufficient attention and remains a major public health issue. Age-standardized incidence (ASIR), prevalence (ASPR), mortality (ASMR), and disability-adjusted life years (ASDR) rates of MASLD from 1990 to 2021 were extracted from the Global Burden of Disease 2021. The estimated annual percentage change was calculated using linear regression. Six time-series models were used for training and comparison, and the optimal model was selected to predict the disease burden from 2022 to 2031. Globally, the ASIR, ASPR, ASMR, and ASDR all exhibited upward trends. Regionally, Western Europe showed the fastest growth in ASIR and ASPR. Eastern Europe showed the fastest growth in ASMR and ASDR, whereas the high-income Asia Pacific demonstrated the most pronounced decline. The hybrid model best predicted ASIR (615.70/100,000) and ASPR (15,275.60/100,000) for 2031, the Neural Network Autoregressive model optimized ASMR (1.64/100,000), and Prophet projected ASDR to decline to 42.08/100,000.

Traditional treatments, including lifestyle changes, insulin, and oral hypoglycemic agents, have limitations, particularly in terms of safety and potential fetal impacts. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, initially developed for type 2 diabetes, have shown promise in managing GDM by improving glycemic control, enhancing insulin sensitivity, and assisting in weight management. However, safety and efficacy data in pregnancy remain limited. A systematic review analyzed 8 clinical trials from ClinicalTrials.gov examining the use of GLP-1 liraglutide, semaglutide, and exenatide in GDM treatment. Studies varied in design, with the majority employing randomized, interventional protocols focusing on glycemic control and insulin sensitivity. Key outcome measures included hemoglobin A1c levels, glucose tolerance, insulin secretion, and progression to type 2 diabetes postpartum. GLP-1 receptor agonists effectively manage blood glucose and reduce pregnancy complications associated with GDM. However, side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort and mild hypoglycemia were common, and all GLP-1 are categorized as pregnancy Category C by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), with potential implications for fetal health due to transplacental passage.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have demonstrated impressive results in managing obesity and T2DM, prompting interest in their potential therapeutic role for MASH with fibrosis. The ESSENCE trial recently investigated the effectiveness of once-weekly semaglutide in patients with biopsy-proven MASH and moderate-to-advanced fibrosis. Interim analysis at 72 weeks demonstrated that semaglutide substantially improved liver histology, effectively resolving steatohepatitis and showing improvement in liver fibrosis, compared to placebo. Consistent with these findings, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has granted accelerated approval to semaglutide (Wegovy) for adults with noncirrhotic MASH and stage 2 or 3 fibrosis. Those hepatic benefits were accompanied with notable improvements in body weight, insulin sensitivity and inflammatory markers. While these preliminary results are encouraging, their clinical relevance will depend on whether they translate into reduced long-term liver complications and amelioration of overall cardio-renal risk.

Mechanistically, GLP-1 signaling modulates immune and inflammatory pathways, regulates autophagy and pyroptosis, alleviates endoplasmic reticulum stress, and interacts with the gut microbiome. These pleiotropic effects provide a rationale for exploring their role in multiple organ systems. Clinical trials have demonstrated cardiovascular and renal protection, leading to additional approvals in high-risk populations. Early data also suggest potential benefits in liver disease, obstructive sleep apnea, chronic respiratory disorders, neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions, reproductive dysfunction, obesity-associated cancers, and sepsis, although these remain investigational.

Data on trends based on sex and race are limited. A cohort of LT listings in adults (2011-2023) for common indications of ALD, MASH, and hepatitis C virus was stratified to hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and non-HCC indications. Change in proportion for each etiology in 2023 vs 2011 was derived. Of 21,087 HCC listings, MASH dominated in males and females, but ALD dominated in black males and in black and Hispanic females. Of 12,087 HCC LT, MASH dominated in both sexes and races, except ALD dominated in black males. Of 80,433 non-HCC listings, ALD dominated in both sexes and races, except MASH dominated in black and Hispanic males. Of 46,289 non-HCC LT, ALD dominated in both sexes and all races.

38852799,"Unravelling the complexities of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis: The role of metabolism, transporters, and herb-drug interactions.","Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a mainstream halting liver disease with high prevalence in North America, Europe, and other world regions. It is an advanced form of NAFLD caused by the amassing of fat in the liver and can progress to the more severe form known as non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Until recently, there was no authorized pharmacotherapy reported for NASH, and to improve the patient's metabolic syndrome, the focus is mainly on lifestyle modification, weight loss, ensuring a healthy diet, and increased physical activity; however, the recent approval of Rezdiffra (Resmetirom) by the US FDA may change this narrative. As per the reported studies, there is an increased articulation of uptake and efflux transporters of the liver, including OATP and MRP, in NASH, leading to changes in the drug's pharmacokinetic properties. This increase leads to alterations in the pharmacokinetic properties of drugs. Furthermore, modifications in Cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes can have a significant impact on these properties. Xenobiotics are metabolized primarily in the liver and constitute liver enzymes and transporters. This review aims to delve into the role of metabolism, transport, and potential herb-drug interactions in the context of NASH.",2024,Aug,Life sciences,Ravi Adinarayan Somabattini; Sahla Sherin; Bhukya Siva; Neelanjan Chowdhury; Satheesh Kumar Nanjappan,1273,True,2024-08-01
41116851,"Associations among serum levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, and METAVIR fibrosis score in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.","We evaluated their diagnostic potential compared to histopathology and standard biochemical tests of liver function. Liver fibrosis is considered a reversible condition, making early diagnosis essential. Serum levels of matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) -1 and MMP-2 are investigated as parameters for diagnosing fibrosis in chronic liver disease. Commercially available ELISA assays were used to study serum levels of MMP-1 and MMP-2 in 50 patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Fibrosis stages were evaluated using the METAVIR scoring system. Spearman's coefficient analysed correlations of serum levels of MMP-1, MMP-2, and liver biopsy score, and specificity and sensitivity were calculated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. MMP-1 levels in fibrosis stage F1 (14.20±3.10 ng/mL) were not significantly different from stage F2 (9.26±2.21 ng/mL) but were higher (p<0.001) than F3 (7.15±1.56 ng/mL) and F4 (4.53±0.62 ng/mL). MMP-2 levels in F1 (68.57±8.22 ng/mL) were similar to F2 (76.31±9.25 ng/mL) but lower (p<0.001) than F3 (103.34±17.59 ng/mL) and F4 (214.24±46.72 ng/mL). Significant differences were seen between mild fibrosis (F1-2) and severe fibrosis/cirrhosis (F3-4) for MMP-1 (p<0.01) and MMP-2 (p<0.001). Correlation analysis revealed a weak inverse correlation for MMP-1 (r=-0.383, p<0.01) and a weak direct correlation for MMP-2 (r=0.392, p<0.01) with fibrosis stages. MMP-2 levels >86.78 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 73.7% and specificity of 61.3% for fibrosis detection, while MMP-1 levels <4.96 ng/mL had a sensitivity of 52.6% and specificity of 32.3%. Using ROC analysis, MMP-2 had significant diagnostic ability in detecting liver fibrosis stages (area under the curve 0.722, p<0.01). Serum levels of MMP-2 are able to detect liver fibrosis. Despite the limited sample size, these findings support further investigation and potential integration of MMP-2 testing into routine clinical practice.",2025,01,Gastroenterology and hepatology from bed to bench,Erdenezaya Odkhuu; Khas Amgalan; Ulzmaa Galsan; Ulzii-Orshikh Namkhai; Badamsuren Dorjgotov; Altantsetseg Battulga; Bat-Erdene Tserendorj; Anarmaa Renchindorj; Bayarsaikhan Ochirchuulgan; Elberelt Unurbat; Suvdaa Bayanzul,1953,True,2025-01-01
40999647,Lithium Toxicity and Altered Clearance Following Initiation of Semaglutide in Patients With Bipolar Disorder: A Case Series and Literature Review.,"Lithium is a mainstay treatment for bipolar disorder, but its narrow therapeutic index and susceptibility to pharmacokinetic interactions make appropriate monitoring crucial. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), such as semaglutide, are increasingly prescribed for type 2 diabetes and weight management. Scarce evidence exists on the potential interaction between semaglutide and lithium. We present 3 cases involving patients on stable lithium regimens who were initiated on semaglutide, reviewing potential mechanisms underlying the interaction between them. In 2 cases, lithium levels increased significantly, leading to toxicity despite stable renal function and no changes in concurrent medications. In the third case, preemptive reductions in lithium dosage mitigated toxicity, although lithium levels remained higher than anticipated. Mechanistic hypotheses that might contribute to semaglutide-associated elevated lithium levels include altered kidney function, dehydration from reduced oral intake, vomiting, or diarrhea, and delayed gastric emptying. To our knowledge, this is one of the first documented case series describing a potential interaction between semaglutide and lithium in the medical literature. These cases underscore the importance of vigilant monitoring when combining lithium with semaglutide, and potentially other GLP-1 RAs. Baseline renal function, hydration status, and lithium levels should be assessed before initiating semaglutide, and lithium levels should be monitored more frequently during therapy. Clinicians prescribing semaglutide to patients on lithium should exercise caution, monitor for signs of toxicity, and provide appropriate patient education. Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms of this potential interaction and its clinical significance.",N/A,01,Journal of clinical psychopharmacology,Majd Al-Soleiti; Jonathan G Leung; Teeba Mubaydeen; Matej Markota; Osama Abulseoud; Balwinder Singh; Christopher L Sola,1830,True,

41073997,Association between atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) and all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD): a cohort study based on NHANES 1999-2018.,"Lipid metabolism plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD). However, the effect of the atherogenic index of plasma (AIP)-a novel biomarker for assessing lipid metabolic abnormalities and atherosclerosis risk-on MASLD-related mortality remains unclear. This study included 6,567 patients with MASLD from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2018), with mortality data linked to National Death Index records through 31 December 2019. Participants were categorised into quartiles based on AIP. The association between baseline AIP and all-cause mortality (ACM) or cardiovascular disease mortality (CVM) were investigated using multivariate Cox Models, with restricted cubic spline (RCS) curves evaluated to assess potential nonlinear associations. Subgroup and mediation analyses explored modifiers and mediator (HbA1c, neutrophils, hypertension), while sensitivity analyses tested the robustness . During a median follow-up period of 122 months, 1,323 all-cause and 447 CVD-related deaths occurred. After adjusting for confounders, higher AIP was significantly associated with an increased CVM risk (HR = 1.34, 95% CI = 1.01-1.79, P = 0.05). No significant association was observed between AIP and ACM (HR = 1.05, 95% CI = 0.89-1.24, P = 0.50). RCS analysis revealed a J-shaped relationship between AIP and ACM (threshold = 1.71), with a significant increase in ACM risk when AIP > 1.71 (HR = 1.48, 95% CI = 1.14-1.92, P = 0.003). Subgroup analyses showed a significant interaction between AIP and age (P In US patients with MASLD, baseline AIP exhibited a J-shaped relationship with ACM.

41066034,Oral semaglutide for weight loss and liver fibrosis in overweight and obesity: A randomized controlled trial.,"Obesity is a leading risk factor for fatty liver disease and weight loss has been shown to improve liver parameters. This study evaluates the efficacy of oral semaglutide for weight loss in individuals with overweight or obesity, excluding those with diabetes mellitus. A randomized, open-label, controlled trial was conducted at the Asian Institute of Gastroenterology, Hyderabad, from June 2022 to December 2023. Adults (≥ 18 years) with a body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 or ≥ 27 with comorbidities (pre-diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive sleep apnea or cardiovascular disease) were randomized into two groups. Both groups received counselling on a reduced-calorie diet and increased physical activity. Group 1 also received oral semaglutide, starting at 3 mg/day and titrated to 14 mg/day over two to four weeks. The objectives were to assess the effects of semaglutide on weight loss, non-invasive markers of liver fibrosis and cardiometabolic parameters. (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT05442450). Total 116 participants (58 per group) completed the study. At 28 weeks, the mean percentage weight reduction was -10.47% (SD 5.3) in the Semaglutide group vs. -2.4% (SD 4.5) in the control group (p < 0.001). Semaglutide treatment significantly improved alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamic-pyruvic transaminase [SGPT]) levels, along with reductions in the aspartate aminotransferase to platelet ratio index (APRI) score, liver fat content and liver stiffness. However, NFS (NAFLD fibrosis score) and FIB-4 (fibrosis-4 index) did not show significant reductions. Improvements in BMI, waist circumference, HbA1c, fasting insulin and C-reactive protein (CRP) were significantly greater with semaglutide (p < 0.001). Total fat mass decreased by 7.3 kg vs. 1.74 kg (p < 0.0001) in controls, while visceral fat ratings dropped by 3.67 vs. 0.6 (p < 0.0001).

41071055,Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Receptor Agonists (GLP1-RA) and the Clinical Outcomes of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD): A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"Prior studies showed worse outcomes in obese inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients, especially those related to hospitalizations, surgery and steroid-free remission. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1-RAs) have demonstrated significant metabolic benefits for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. Hence, GLP1-RAs may improve clinical outcomes in patients with IBD, especially those with obesity. The objective was to systematically evaluate the impact of GLP1-RAs on clinical outcomes in patients with IBD. A comprehensive literature search was performed using the databases PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library from inception to 15-03-2025. Studies reporting outcomes related to GLP1-RAs in patients with IBD were included. Primary outcomes included weight loss and various IBD-related co-endpoints such as hospitalizations, surgery, corticosteroid use, and advanced therapy initiation. In total, 11 studies with 16,242 patients with IBD treated with GLP1-RAs were included. Weight loss was achieved using semaglutide (-9.6 kg, CI-95% -12.0; -7.2), liraglutide (-9.4 kg, CI-95% -13.0; -5.8) and tirzepatide (-11.8 kg, CI-95% -18.3; -5.4) after 3 months of follow-up. In meta-analyses, GLP1-RAs were associated with lower risk of surgery for effect sizes (logHR: 0.61 [95%-CI 0.44-0.84], I2 = 0%) and event frequencies (OR: 0.46 [95%-CI 0.32-0.67], I2 = 42%). Sensitivity analysis for BMI showed lower risk of hospitalizations and surgery in patients with obesity (BMI≥30).

40538007,Mechanism of Semaglutide in MASLD Treatment: Where Is the Master Key?,"Semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA), is used for weight reduction and metabolic improvement. Semaglutide effectively improves MASH but not confers histological fibrosis resolution. The key question remains whether semaglutide exerts direct, independent effects in ameliorating MASH or if its benefits are merely secondary to improvements in weight, insulin resistance, and glycemic control. The exact mechanisms of action through which semaglutide or other GLP-1 RAs offer liver protection are not entirely clear. A comprehensive search in PubMed and EMBASE was conducted using the keywords ""Semaglutide and NAFLD/MASLD"", ""glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist and MASLD/NALFD"", and ""Semaglutide and type II diabetes/obesity and hypertension"". Relevant papers published before February, 2025, were included. Semaglutide modulates several lipid-associated molecular pathways through unknown mechanisms. Preclinical and clinical studies suggest that semaglutide acts by (i) reducing appetite and increasing satiety, thereby decreasing dietary intake and subsequent free fatty acid export to the liver; (ii) reducing insulin resistance and improving insulin sensitivity and adipose dysfunction; (iii) reducing de novo lipogenesis by downregulating ChREBP and SREBP-1c signaling, as well as the expression of lipid-synthesizing genes; (iv) reducing the weight of white and brown adipose tissue; and (v) reducing inflammation by decreasing pro-inflammatory markers in GLP-1-expressing macrophages and favorably altering the gut microbiota. While this review explores the potential mechanisms of semaglutide action, the lack of GLP-1 receptor expression in the livers of mice and humans suggests that these mechanisms are associated with indirect modulation. Consequently, further mechanistic studies are needed to elucidate these pathways. NOT APPLICABLE.",2025,Sep,Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology,Devaraj Ezhilarasan,1885,True,2025-09-01

Chitosan coated selenium nanoparticles (CS-SeNPs), a new kind of selenium supplement. In vitro study, CS-SeNPs remarkably decreased FFA-induced lipid accumulation. CS-SeNPs could reverse the inhibition effects of FFA on the autophagy process. Inhibition of autophagy increased lipid accumulation and TC and TG levels, and decreased the expression levels of fat metabolism-related genes. In vivo analysis, CS-SeNPs administration apparently improved the pathological changes in NAFLD, including body weight, liver function, serum lipids, and liver histopathological changes. Additionally, autophagy levels in the liver were also increased, oxidative stress and inflammation were reduced after CS-SeNPs treatment. In summary, CS-SeNPs showed protective effects on NAFLD both in vivo and in vitro, likely through a mechanism involving promotion of lipid degradation and reduction of fat accumulation in hepatocytes by inducing lipid autophagy.",2025,Oct,Biochimica et biophysica acta.

Autophagy and endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress are key pathways in NAFLD pathogenesis. This study investigates the therapeutic potential of Chlorella vulgaris (CV) microalgae and Lactobacillus casei (LBC) probiotics on liver function in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD mouse model. Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into five groups: control, NAFLD (HFD for 8 weeks), NAFLD + CV, NAFLD + LBC, and NAFLD + CV + LBC. Liver enzymes, lipid profiles, oxidative stress markers, inflammatory cytokines, and gene expression related to UPR, autophagy, and apoptosis were measured, along with stereological and histopathological analyses. CV and LBC treatments significantly improved serum ALT, AST, cholesterol, LDL, triglycerides, MDA, LPS, TNF-α, IL-6, and CRP while modulating UPR (GRP78, IRE1α, PERK, ATF6), autophagy (Beclin1, P62, LC3-IIB), and apoptosis (Caspase-3, BAX/Bcl-2 ratio) pathways. In treated groups, stereological analysis showed reduced liver weight, volume, and histopathological damage (p < 0.05).

Clinical trials required a histological diagnosis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with F2-F3 fibrosis, excluding cirrhosis, while real-world prescribing relies on non-invasive tests (NITs). This study evaluates their efficacy in identifying the target population within a biopsy-proven Turkish MASLD cohort. We analyzed 266 patients with biopsy-proven MASLD from the Turkish NAFLD Biobank. Inclusion required AST >17 U/L (females) or >20 U/L (males), and CAP ≥280 dB/m. Eligibility was defined by liver stiffness measurement (LSM) of 10-19.9 kPa (excluding cirrhosis or low platelet count) or a FAST score ≥0.67. Among the study population, 130 patients (48.9%) had histologically confirmed MASH with F2-F3 fibrosis. Based on LSM criteria applied to histologically eligible patients, 81 patients (62.3%) were underdiagnosed, compared to 95 patients (73.1%) when using the FAST score. Additionally, among patients who corresponded to NIT, 34 patients (41.0%) were overprescribed using LSM, while 23 patients (39.7%) were overprescribed using the FAST score. The kappa value as a measure of agreement showed poor compatibility for both LSM and FAST with liver biopsy (0.128 and 0.101, respectively). When treatment decisions were guided by either of the NITs, 44 patients (44.0%) received unnecessary prescriptions, and 74 patients (44.6%) had missed diagnoses. The NITs defined for identifying the target population for resmetirom demonstrated poor performance in accurately detecting or excluding eligible patients. Therefore, performing a liver biopsy before starting resmetirom treatment will prevent unnecessary increases in cost and significantly reduce the economic burden of the treatment.

41131568,"Evaluation of a new TyG indicator, TyHGB, in predicting non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: evidence from two independent populations.","As non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) becomes increasingly common and affects population health, simple and effective screening tools for NAFLD are essential. The triglyceride high-density cholesterol-glucose body index (TyHGB), a novel metabolic index, has shown promise for predicting metabolic disorders. The objective of this research was to assess TyHGB's predictive capability for NAFLD across two distinct cohorts. This retrospective study utilized data obtained from two independent cohorts: a Chinese hospital cohort (n = 181,241) and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) cohort (n = 3,286). TyHGB was computed according to the following equation: triglyceride level/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol level + 0.7 × fasting blood glucose level (mmol/L) + 0.1 × body mass index (kg/m²). NAFLD was diagnosed using ultrasonography. The TyHGB-NAFLD association was evaluated using multivariable logistic regression analysis, restricted cubic spline methodology, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. To establish the added predictive capacity of TyHGB over the triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) were determined. In both cohorts, participants with higher TyHGB values demonstrated a significantly higher prevalence of NAFLD. After full adjustment for potential confounders, the odds ratios for NAFLD on comparing the highest versus lowest quartiles of TyHGB were 12.22 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.73-13.93) in the Chinese cohort and 3.17 (95% CI: 2.25-4.46) in the NHANES cohort. Restricted cubic spline modeling demonstrated significant nonlinear associations between TyHGB values and NAFLD risk in both populations (P for nonlinearity < 0.001). TyHGB demonstrated superior discriminative ability for NAFLD in comparison with the TyG index, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.8410 versus 0.7995 in the Chinese cohort and 0.6492 versus 0.5952 in the NHANES cohort (both P < 0.001). Adding TyHGB to the baseline prediction models significantly improved risk discrimination, with greater improvements than those achieved by adding TyG (NRI: 0.0183, 95% CI: 0.015-0.0217; IDI: 0.0067, 95% CI: 0.0057-0.0076; both P < 0.001). TyHGB demonstrated robust and superior performance in predicting NAFLD in comparison with the established TyG index across two diverse populations. Since TyHGB only requires routinely measured clinical parameters, it represents a practical and equitable tool for early NAFLD risk stratification across diverse healthcare settings, potentially reducing health disparities in liver disease detection and enabling cost-effective prevention strategies at the population level.",2025,Oct,Lipids in health and disease,Enfa Zhao; Ruimeng Wang; Yiqing Chen; Hang Xie; Yuan Gao; Bingtian Dong; Chaoxue Zhang,2749,True,2025-10-01
41121520,Deep learning-enhanced 3D imaging unveils semaglutide impact on cardiac fibrosis.,"Myocardial fibrosis (MF), a hallmark of structural cardiac remodelling, drives disease progression across most forms of heart failure and plays a central role in heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). Despite its clinical relevance, effective treatments remain scarce. In preclinical models, current methods for quantifying MF fail to capture its regional heterogeneity, limiting reliable assessment of novel anti-fibrotic compounds. This study aimed to develop a whole-heart imaging and deep learning (DL)-based quantification pipeline for MF, and to validate its utility by evaluating the efficacy of a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist in a mouse model of HFpEF. By utilising fluorescent collagen-labelling dye, tissue clearing and three-dimensional light sheet fluorescence microscopy (3D LSFM), we developed a high-throughput imaging platform for MF. We established a DL framework to quantify interstitial, perivascular and replacement fibrosis, as well as hypertrophy, in 17 left ventricular (LV) segments. The antifibrotic efficacy of the GLP-1R agonist semaglutide was evaluated in the db/db UNx-ReninAAV mouse model, which exhibits diabetes, kidney failure, obesity and hypertension. Whole-heart 3D LSFM, combined with DL, enabled micrometre-resolution mapping of MF in rodents. Using this approach, we observed that interstitial collagen content increases proportionally with cardiac hypertrophy. Chronic treatment with semaglutide reduced LV hypertrophy and perivascular fibrosis but did not affect the extent of replacement fibrosis. The established 3D imaging and quantification approach provides a powerful tool for evaluating the therapeutic efficacy of antifibrotic compounds and studying the pathological mechanisms underlying cardiovascular diseases.",2025,Oct,British journal of pharmacology,Sheyla Barrado-Ballestero; Sarah Torp Yttergren; Max Hahn; Marie Biviano Rosenkilde; Ditte Marie Jensen; Michael Christensen; Louise Thisted; Heidi Lindgreen Holmberg; Geoffrey Teixeira; Tor Biering-Sørensen; Casper Gravesen Salinas; Urmas Roostalu,1802,True,2025-10-01
41022304,Furin may contribute to proglucagon processing and glucagon-like Peptide-1 production in human alpha cells.,"While glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) production has been previously documented in human alpha cells, the steps regulating its production and secretion are poorly characterized. We investigated the enzymes implicated in proglucagon processing, characterizing their expression and localization in primary human alpha cells and αTC1/9 cells. Human alpha cells and αTC1/9 cells were maintained in control conditions or exposed to proinflammatory and Akt-activating stimuli to enhance GLP-1 levels. Proglucagon and convertase enzyme gene expression, protein content, and subcellular localization were evaluated by qPCR, Western Blot, and immunofluorescent microscopy, respectively. Our data suggests that the canonical GLP-1-producing enzyme, Prohormone Convertase 1/3 (PC1/3), is poorly expressed and localized in alpha cells, while its homologue furin is optimally positioned for GLP-1 production. We also note that GLP-1 and glucagon processing occur in different subcellular compartments, creating two distinct pools of secretory granules which respond to similar secretory stimuli. Our study suggests that furin, rather than PC1/3, is positioned to process proglucagon into GLP-1, and despite coming from the same precursor molecule, GLP-1 and glucagon are separately packaged in primary human alpha cells.",2025,Sep,Molecular metabolism,Janyne Koepke; Wentong Long; Amy Barr; Peter E Light,1308,True,2025-09-01
41011291,Obeticholic Acid and Other Farnesoid-X-Receptor (FXR) Agonists in the Treatment of Liver Disorders.,"The Farnesoid-X-receptor (FXR) is a bile sensor involved in the regulation of bile acid homeostasis, fibrosis, inflammation, and metabolism. Obeticholic acid (OCA), a semisynthetic derivative of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), initially named 6-ethyl-CDCA or INT-747, is the first in a class of FXR ligands that have been approved for clinical use for the treatment of patients with primary biliary cholangitis (PBC) who are unresponsive or intolerant to ursodeoxycholic acid. In this narrative review, we will examine the current status and future perspective of clinical use of OCA. Based on results from phase 2 and 3 clinical trials, OCA received a conditional market approval for its use as a second-line treatment for the management of PBC in 2016. However, concerns over drug (OCA)-induced liver injury (DILI), including hepatic decompensation in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic PBC patients, have led to discontinuation of OCA commercialization in the EU, but not in North America and the UK, in 2024. Based on positive results from preclinical models, OCA has been investigated also for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Results from phase 2 and 3 trials, however, have shown that while OCA reduces liver fibrosis, the beneficial effects on steatosis are marginal, thus preventing its clinical approval under the current regulatory guidelines. Here, we review potential applications of OCA in PBC patients in the context of a highly competitive therapeutic landscape, generated by the approval for clinical use of safer and effective second-line therapies, including PPARs agonists such as elafibranor and seladelapar and increased off-label use of fibrates. The current status of development of second-generation FXR agonists such as cilofexor, tropifexor, and vonafexor and their potential in the treatment of liver fibrosis in MASH will be discussed and compared to recently approved therapies, resmetirom, and semaglutide, a GLP-1 agonist. Finally, since some of the novel candidates for treating MASH, have shown limited efficacy on liver fibrosis, we suggest that development of combinatorial therapies based on FXR ligands and agents acting on different molecular targets might offer the opportunity for the repositioning of drug candidates whose development has been abandoned for insufficient efficacy, minimizing/recovering costs linked to drug development.",2025,Sep,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",Stefano Fiorucci; Ginevra Urbani; Eleonora Distrutti; Michele Biagioli,2411,True,2025-09-01

41155354,Class-Specific Effects of ARBs Versus ACE Inhibitors on Survival and Cardiovascular Outcomes in MASLD.,"Renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors, including angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs), have been associated with improved outcomes in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We aimed to assess the differential impact of ACEIs versus ARBs on survival and cardiovascular outcomes in individuals with MASLD. Using data from the UK Biobank, we identified 52,143 participants with exclusive use of either an ACEI or ARB. Individuals with viral, autoimmune, cholestatic, or alcohol-related liver disease were excluded. MASLD was defined as fatty liver index ≥ 60 with ≥1 cardiometabolic risk factor. Inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) was used to adjust for confounders. Outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular events, hepatic decompensation, and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models.

41056563,Evolving trends and comparative outcomes of bridging transarterial locoregional therapy in liver transplant candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma.,"Bridging locoregional therapy (LRT) is widely used in liver transplant (LT) candidates with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to minimize waitlist dropout and evaluate tumor biology. While transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) has historically been the predominant approach, the role of transarterial radioembolization (TARE) is expanding. Comparative effectiveness data for these two modalities as bridging strategies remain limited. This study assessed the trends, factors influencing therapy selection, and outcomes of transarterial bridging locoregional therapy. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of adult LT candidates with HCC listed in the Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN) between 2016 and 2024 who received TACE or TARE as their sole bridging LRT. Inverse probability weighting (IPW) was applied to balance baseline covariates. Multivariable Fine-Gray competing risk regression and stratified Cox proportional hazards, Logistic regression models were used to assess waitlist dropout, complete pathological necrosis (CPN), recurrence, and overall survival. Among 8,367 patients, 5,472 (65%) received TACE and 2,895 (35%) received TARE. TARE use increased significantly from 22.5% to 51.7% over the study period. TARE was more likely to be used among patients with MASLD, older age, and high tumor burden, and less likely in those with lower socioeconomic status. TARE recipients had a significantly lower risk of waitlist dropout (sHR 0.83, p<0.001) and a higher likelihood of achieving CPN (aOR 2.24, p<0.001). The overall survival did not differ significantly between groups (aHR 0.94, p=0.19). The use of transarterial radioembolization as bridging therapy in HCC liver transplant candidates has surged, and is influenced by socioeconomic factors, comorbidities, and tumor burden. Transarterial radioembolization effectiveness has been demonstrated by its advantages in waitlist retention and tumor necrosis. Further studies are warranted to evaluate its impact on post-liver transplant recurrence and to validate the cost-effectiveness among transarterial therapies.",2025,Oct,Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society,Butros Fakhoury; Vinay Jahagirdar; Marwan Alsaqa; Leandro Sierra; Iyiad Alabdulrazzak; Ximena Parraga; Mian B Khalid; Alan Bonder; Rakesh Vinayek; Behnam Saberi,2104,True,2025-10-01

41090750,Circulating and Tissue Galectin-3 in Gastrointestinal Inflammation: Clinical Significance and Biomarker Potential.,"Galectins represent a family of widely expressed lectins that have the ability to bind β-galactoside in modulating ""cell-to-cell"" and ""cell-to-matrix"" interactions in all organisms. These proteins are expressed in many inflammatory cells, such as macrophages, and depending on the inflammatory environment, they promote pro-inflammatory or anti-inflammatory responses. Galectin-3 (Gal-3) is predominantly located in the cytoplasm, but, as noted, it has also been detected in the nucleus, on the cell surface and in the extracellular environment, which indicates the multifunctionality of this molecule. It has been shown in many studies that Gal-3 is involved in immune regulation, fibrosis, and tissue remodeling, making it an important player in disorders such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and liver fibrosis. In IBD, this protein is associated with activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, contributing to chronic intestinal inflammation. Also, in primary biliary cholangitis and autoimmune hepatitis, Gal-3 potentiate development of fibrosis through fibroblast-to-myofibroblast transition and extracellular matrix deposition, while in liver fibrosis, it is upregulated in hepatic stellate cells and macrophages, promoting fibrosis and inflammation. Studies show that Gal-3 inhibition reduces fibrosis and inflammation, making it a promising therapeutic target.",2025,Sep,Cells,Vesna Brzački; Andriana Jovanović; Andrija Rančić; Snežana Tešić-Rajković; Gordana Petrović; Ivan Nagorni; Marko Stojanović; Elena Stanković; Stefan Momčilović,1408,True,2025-09-01
41000700,"Metabolomic, Lipidomic, and Enterohormone Changes in the Progression from MASLD to MASH.","Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH) represent progressive stages of liver disease, with distinct metabolic and cellular alterations. This study investigates the progression from MASLD to MASH through metabolomics, lipidomics, and assessment of hormones. Male C57BL/6NTac mice were fed a high-fat diet for 16 weeks to induce MASLD and for 29 weeks to develop MASH. Aged-matched controls on a normal diet were used for comparison. Histology confirmed the progression of MASLD to MASH. We performed metabolomic and lipidomic profiling of liver, colon, and stool samples to identify metabolic and lipid alterations. Plasma enteroendocrine hormones and cytokines were quantified. Immunofluorescence was performed to assess enteroendocrine cells changes in the colon and the association of serotonin (5-HT) with fibronectin in the liver. Metabolomic and lipidomic analysis revealed significant alterations at different stages of the disease. Specifically, cholic acid was increased across the liver, colon, and stool in both MASLD and MASH mice compared to controls. Compared to the control group, MASLD mice exhibited an increase in enteroendocrine hormones, GLP-1, GIP, and PYY, whereas no changes were observed in MASH mice. Comparing MASLD to MASH livers, we found hepatic 5-HT levels were increased in MASH mice compared to MASLD mice. The MASH liver also exhibited a colocalization between fibronectin and 5-HT, suggesting a potential role of 5-HT in liver fibrosis. Our study provides novel insights into the progressive metabolic and hormonal changes from MASLD to MASH. The increase in cholic acid and differential enteroendocrine hormone responses highlight the complex interactions between the gut and liver in metabolic liver diseases. These findings suggest that enteroendocrine hormones may play a role in the progression of MASLD to MASH as well as liver fibrosis, offering potential therapeutic avenues for targeting the gut-liver axis in metabolic liver diseases.",2025,Sep,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,Jaclyn A Rivas; Alexandria C Murphy; Praveena Prasad; Siem S Goitom; Aaron S Romero; Crystal Madera Enriquez; Brianna B Maes; Prithvi R Akepati; Marcus A Garcia; Fredine T Lauer; Rama R Gullapalli; Kristen M Gonzales; Jessica M Gross; Jing Pu; Shuguang Leng; Julie G In; Melanie R McReynolds; Eliseo F Castillo,2064,True,2025-09-01

To validate the CDAA-HFD mouse, we evaluated disease progression and responsiveness to dietary and pharmacological interventions with semaglutide, lanifibranor, elafibranor, obeticholic acid (OCA), firsocostat, and resmetirom. Disease phenotyping was performed in C57BL/6J mice fed CDAA-HFD for 3-20 wk and ranked using the MASLD Human Proximity Score (MHPS). Semaglutide, lanifibranor, elafibranor, OCA, firsocostat, or resmetirom were profiled as treatment intervention for 8 wk, starting after 6 wk of CDAA-HFD feeding. Semaglutide and lanifibranor were further evaluated as early (preventive) therapy for 9 wk, starting 3 wk after CDAA-HFD diet feeding. In addition, benefits of dietary intervention (chow reversal) for 8 wk were characterized following 6 wk of CDAA-HFD feeding. CDAA-HFD mice demonstrated a nonobese phenotype with fast onset and progression of MASH and fibrosis, high similarity to human MASH-fibrosis, and tumor development after 20 wk of diet-induction. Semaglutide and lanifibranor partially reversed fibrosis when administered as prevention but not as treatment intervention. Elafibranor was the only interventional drug therapy to improve fibrosis. In comparison, chow-reversal resulted in complete regression of steatosis with improved liver inflammation and fibrosis in CDAA-HFD mice. CDAA-HFD mice recapitulate histological hallmarks of advanced MASH with progressive severe fibrosis, however, in the absence of a clinical translational obese dysmetabolic phenotype. CDAA-HFD mice are suitable for profiling drug candidates directly targeting hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis.

41103645,Sugar-sweetened beverage consumption predicts metabolic associated fatty liver disease in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.,"Metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, with heightened prevalence and progression risks in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Emerging evidence suggests dietary factors, particularly sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption, may exacerbate metabolic dysregulation, yet this relationship remains underexplored in MAFLD populations. We enrolled 3,305 T2DM patients from Taizhou University Hospital, classifying them into MAFLD and non-MAFLD groups via liver ultrasonography. SSB consumption was quantified as weekly intake. Clinical parameters and SSB consumption were analyzed using logistic regression. External validation leveraged NHANES data, focusing on total sugar intake and surrogate markers. MAFLD patients exhibited significantly higher BMI, waist/hip ratios, and SSB consumption than non-MAFLD counterparts (p<0.001). SSB consumption emerged as an independent MAFLD risk factor, with dose-dependent escalation in MAFLD odds. The MAFLD model based on glycometabolism (MMBG), integrating SSB consumption, C-peptide, and glucose, outperformed traditional indices, such as TyG, VAI, and AIP, achieving superior AUC (0.712 vs. 0.631-0.666), enhanced clinical utility and higher Brier scores (p<0.05, respectively). NHANES validation confirmed BMI, central obesity, hyperglycemia, and sugar intake as MAFLD predictors. SSB consumption independently predicts MAFLD risk in T2DM patients, with synergistic effects from dysregulated glycometabolism. The MMBG model, incorporating SSB consumption and glycometabolic parameters, offers a robust tool for early MAFLD risk identification and personalized interventions.",2025,01,Frontiers in endocrinology,Zhenjun Yu; Mengdie Chen; Shicheng Gu; Chaohui Wang; Ping Feng; Gang Lin,1699,True,2025-01-01

A systematic search of PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the gastrointestinal adverse events of GLP-1RAs in T2DM patients. Inclusion criteria included adult patients with confirmed T2DM receiving any GLP-1RA, with the outcomes focused on gastrointestinal adverse events such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, dyspepsia, and reduced appetite. Bayesian network meta-analysis was used to calculate the odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the comparison of gastrointestinal side effects among different GLP-1RAs. A total of 48 RCTs involving 27,729 participants were included in the analysis. The overall incidence of gastrointestinal adverse events was 11.66%, with nausea being the most frequent (21.49%) and reduced appetite the least frequent (5.49%). Tirzepatide had the highest risk of inducing nausea and diarrhea, while dulaglutide and lixisenatide had the lowest risks. Exenatide exhibited the highest incidence of vomiting, while dulaglutide showed a lower risk. Semaglutide demonstrated a significantly higher risk of diarrhea compared to other GLP-1RAs. This study highlights significant differences in the gastrointestinal adverse event profiles of various GLP-1RAs. Tirzepatide exhibited the highest risk of gastrointestinal side effects, whereas dulaglutide and exenatide showed relatively better tolerability. These findings provide valuable insights for clinicians to make informed treatment decisions, emphasizing the importance of individualized therapy based on patient tolerance.

41061777,Structural perspective on the design of selective DYRK1B inhibitors.,"Dual-specificity tyrosine-phosphorylation-regulated kinase 1B (DYRK1B) has recently emerged as a critical therapeutic target in oncology and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. As a kinase, DYRK1B plays key roles in regulating cellular survival pathways; however, the lack of structural information has impeded the development of selective inhibitors. In this study, we implemented multi-method framework: recombinant expression and stability profiling, cellular target engagement, enzyme inhibition, biophysical thermodynamics, cell-based pathway readout, X-ray crystallography, quantum-mechanical and molecular-dynamics analyses. We report the crystal structure of DYRK1B in complex with the small-molecule inhibitor AZ191. For comparative purposes, we also present the structure of the closely related kinase, DYRK1A, bound to the same ligand. While a structural overlay of the two kinase domains reveals overall negligible differences, detailed inspection highlights distinct features within the hinge-binding region of DYRK1B that are pivotal for achieving kinase selectivity. Moreover, detailed evaluation of the active site architecture reveals a notable difference in the accessibility of the catalytic lysine residue between DYRK1B and DYRK1A, suggesting potential strategies to distinguish selective binders. Overall, these findings provide important macromolecular insights into the DYRK1B structure and offer a structural framework to guide medicinal chemistry efforts towards improved inhibitor selectivity with minimized off-target activity.",2025,Oct,International journal of biological macromolecules,Przemyslaw Grygier; Katarzyna Pustelny; Filipe Menezes; Malgorzata Jemiola-Rzeminska; Piotr Suder; Grzegorz Dubin; Anna Czarna,1555,True,2025-10-01

This review explores emerging therapies for NASH that go beyond traditional lifestyle modifications. The complex pathophysiology of NASH, involving insulin resistance, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation, offers multiple targets for therapeutic intervention. While lifestyle changes remain fundamental, their limitations in achieving sustained improvements highlight the need for effective pharmacological and interventional therapies. This review discusses novel pharmacological approaches, including farnesoid X receptor (FXR) agonists, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) agonists, and agents addressing metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis. Promising candidates such as obeticholic acid, lanifibranor, and semaglutide are highlighted, along with combination therapies targeting multiple pathways simultaneously. Non-pharmacological interventions, including bariatric surgery, endoscopic bariatric and metabolic therapies, and innovative exercise regimens, are also examined for their potential in NASH management. Despite significant advancements, NASH drug development faces challenges due to the disease's complexity, patient heterogeneity, and stringent regulatory requirements. This review also addresses these limitations and explores future directions, including personalized medicine approaches, non-invasive diagnostic tools, and the potential of microbiome modulation and regenerative therapies. The evolving landscape of NASH research emphasizes the need for multidisciplinary approaches integrating advances in diagnostics, therapeutics, and digital health technologies. As the field progresses, the focus remains on developing more effective, personalized, and accessible strategies for preventing, diagnosing, and treating NASH, with the ultimate goal of improving outcomes for patients affected by this increasingly prevalent liver disease.",2024,Sep,Cureus,Shradha P Kakde; Maham Mushtaq; Maryyam Liaqat; Husnain Ali; Muhammad Muaz Mushtaq; Muhammad Asad Sarwer; Sami Ullah; Muhammad Wali Hassan; Asma Khalid; Syed Faqeer Hussain Bokhari,2059,True,2024-09-01
40990658,The different colorectal tumor risk related to GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors use: a network meta-analysis of 68 randomized controlled trials.,"Recent evidence has raised concerns about potential pro-oncogenic effects associated with glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, particularly regarding gastrointestinal malignancies. Colorectal tumors, the third most diagnosed cancer globally, already show increased incidence in patients with metabolic disorders who typically require these medications. For example, obese subjects had significantly higher risk of colorectal tumor than healthy subjects. However, existing evidence on this association remains inconsistent. This network meta-analysis (NMA) evaluated the comparative incidence of colorectal tumors associated with specific GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors. We conducted a confirmatory NMA focused specifically on colorectal tumor incidence as an adverse effect, following Cochrane methodological recommendations. We performed a frequentist-based NMA of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating GLP-1 receptor agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors. Our primary outcome was colorectal tumor incidence, with safety profiles assessed by dropout rates as a secondary outcome. This NMA encompassing 68 RCTs with 207,200 participants found that only semaglutide was associated with increased incidence of colorectal tumors compared to controls. A dose-stratified analysis revealed that high-dose injectable semaglutide (2.4 mg/week) was the only regimen associated with increased incidence. Further, when focusing on RCTs of obese subjects, this increased colorectal tumor rate related to semaglutide still existed. Neither other GLP-1 receptor agonists nor any SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated significant associations with colorectal tumor development. Our study provides the first comprehensive NMA addressing incidence of colorectal tumor related to individual GLP-1 receptor agonists and SGLT2 inhibitors, suggesting a dose-dependent relationship to semaglutide, particularly in its high-dose injectable form (2.4 mg/week). These findings represent a potential risk signal that requires further validation given the already elevated baseline colorectal tumor risk in the target population, especially in subjects with obesity. Future research should focus on long-term follow-up studies to better characterize the mechanisms and clinical implications of this semaglutide-specific risk signal.",2025,Sep,"International journal of surgery (London, England)",Chao-Ming Hung; Bing-Yan Zeng; Chih-Wei Hsu; Po-Huang Chen; Cheuk-Kwan Sun; Andre F Carvalho; Brendon Stubbs; Yen-Wen Chen; Tien-Yu Chen; Wei-Te Lei; Jiann-Jy Chen; Yow-Ling Shiue; Kuan-Pin Su; Chih-Sung Liang; Ping-Tao Tseng,2381,True,2025-09-01

The conceptual rainfall–runoff model (CRR) is widely applied to flood forecasting. The major difficulty associated with the use of CRR models in hydrology is their calibration since most of these models involve a large number of parameters. In order to calibrate the parameters of the CRR model, an improved quadratic interpolation optimization algorithm (IQIO) was proposed. The tent chaos mapping was used to initialize the population, adaptive optimizer probability based on individual adaptation value was used to balance algorithm’s global exploration and local exploitation ability. Thirteen mathematical benchmark functions were used to test the IQIO algorithm. The results showed that the IQIO algorithm exhibited strong exploration capability and fast convergence speed. The CRR model parameters optimized by the IQIO algorithm exhibited high performance, with Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE) values reaching 0.951 during the calibration period and 0.913 during the validation period.

However, the optimal tirzepatide dose following a switch from 1.0 mg of semaglutide remains unclear. This retrospective study included 15 T2DM patients who switched to tirzepatide due to inadequate weight loss. All patients started tirzepatide at 2.5 mg, with escalation to either 7.5 mg (n=10) or 10 mg (n=5). Changes in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and body weight were assessed over a 3-month period. The 10 mg group experienced a significant reduction in HbA1c (-0.7%±0.3%, P<0.01) and a non-significant trend toward weight loss (-6.6±5.4 kg, P=0.07).

41053816,From needles to pills: oral GLP-1 therapy enters the obesity arena.,"Obesity remains a major global health challenge, driving type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and other complications. Despite effective lifestyle and surgical interventions, pharmacotherapy uptake has historically been limited. Injectable GLP-1 receptor agonists, including semaglutide and tirzepatide, have redefined expectations for medical obesity therapy, achieving 15–20% weight reductions in clinical trials. However, barriers such as injections, cost, and adherence limit their real-world use. In September 2025, two pivotal phase-3 trials of oral GLP-1 therapies were published. ATTAIN-1 evaluated orforglipron in 3,127 adults with obesity over 72 weeks, demonstrating a mean weight loss of 11.2%, ≥ 10% weight loss in 54.6%, and improvements in cardiometabolic parameters. OASIS-4 studied oral semaglutide 25 mg in 307 adults over 64 weeks, showing a mean weight loss of 13.6%, ≥ 10% weight loss in 63%, and favorable metabolic changes. Both agents exhibited gastrointestinal adverse events consistent with the GLP-1 class; additionally, orforglipron had five mild pancreatitis cases, while oral semaglutide reported mild dysesthesia. These results confirm that oral GLP-1 receptor agonists can produce clinically meaningful weight loss and metabolic benefits, expanding options beyond injectables. Real-world adoption will hinge on adherence, tolerability, long-term safety, patient preference, and payer coverage. Oral GLP-1 therapies represent a transformative step in obesity management, offering a convenient alternative that may broaden access and optimize individualized care.",2025,Oct,Cardiovascular diabetology.

41090945,The cost-effectiveness of subcutaneous semaglutide 2.4 mg in the management of people living with obesity and prediabetes in England.,"Prediabetes and type 2 diabetes (T2D) are more prevalent amongst people living with obesity (PwO). T2D and obesity increase the risk of cardiovascular disease. In the STEP clinical development program, once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide (2.4 mg) reduced body weight by 10-15% and reversed prediabetes in about 80% of patients. The aim of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of semaglutide plus diet and exercise (D&E) compared with D&E alone in PwO and prediabetes in England based on the STEP-10 trial. The published Core Obesity Model was populated with baseline characteristics and treatment efficacy from STEP-10. This study assessed the reversal of prediabetes at 52 weeks. Baseline age and body mass index (BMI) were 53 (SD = 11) years and 40.1 (6.9) kg/m The treatment duration in the base case analysis was 20 years. The use of semaglutide resulted in 1.105 QALY gained at an additional cost of 19,391 GBP. The resulting ICER was 17,547 GBP/QALY gained. Treatment with semaglutide extended life expectancy by 1.68 years. Ranging treatment duration between 1 year as per STEP 10 trial and lifelong resulted in an ICER of 7,152 to 17,695 GBP/QALY. Results did not differ significantly by subgroup. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis indicated a 90% chance of semaglutide being cost-effective at a willingness-to-pay threshold of 20,000 GBP/QALY. Semaglutide is a cost-effective treatment option for PwO and prediabetes in England based on the results of the STEP-10 trial.",2025,Dec,Journal of medical economics,Mafalda Ramos; Sara Larsen; Francesco Fusco; Mark Lamotte; Matthew Capehorn,1497,True,2025-12-01
41101795,How to measure the core functions of primary care in low-income and middle-income country settings.,"The core functions of primary care are first contact access, comprehensiveness, continuity, coordination and person-centredness. These five core functions are highlighted as essential aspects of quality by the new WHO's measurement framework. In low-income and middle-income countries, the core functions are rarely measured and routinely collected data does not support their measurement. Existing international tools to measure the quality of primary care may evaluate some aspects of these core functions, but none of the reviewed tools focused on all of them. In sub-Saharan Africa, the Primary Care Assessment Tool has been developed over the last decade and a regional version of the tool has been validated to only measure the core functions as defined by the WHO. The tool uses exit interviews with users as recommended by the WHO. The tool has been piloted in South Africa, Uganda and Benin and will now be implemented in 11 African countries. The tool can enable low-income and middle-income countries to measure the core functions and plan interventions to improve the quality of primary care.",2025,Oct,BMJ global health,Robert Mash; Innocent Besigye; Kéfilath Bello; Anna Galle,1105,True,2025-10-01

Plasma levels of 14 apolipoproteins (apoA-I, A-II, A-IV, B100, C-I, C-II, C-III, D, E, F, H, J, L1, M) were quantified using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in a cross-sectional study of 148 individuals with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. Based on liver histology, participants were categorized as non-MASH (n = 94; no liver alterations or simple steatosis, ≥ 5% intrahepatic fat) or MASH (n = 54; steatosis with ballooning and lobular inflammation, with or without fibrosis). Correlations with clinical and biochemical parameters were assessed via Spearman's rank correlation, and associations with MASH were evaluated using logistic regression. Incremental predictive value beyond established risk factors was assessed through likelihood ratio tests (LRT), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). ApoC-III and apoL1 were significantly higher in MASH compared with non-MASH participants, while other apolipoproteins showed no group differences. Higher apoE, apoL1 and apoJ levels were associated with increased odds of MASH, independently of age and sex. Associations for apoL1 and apoJ remained significant after adjustment for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, or for established MASH risk factors including insulin resistance, triglycerides, waist circumference, and the AST/ALT ratio. LRT analyses showed that apoJ (ΔDeviance = 4.085, p = 0.043) and apoL1 (ΔDeviance = 3.954, p = 0.047) each improved model fit, with their combination providing additional improvement (ΔDeviance = 7.534, p = 0.023). NRI analysis indicated that the combination of apoJ and apoL1 provided the largest improvement (NRI total = 0.39, p = 0.026), mainly by correctly reclassifying non-MASH individuals (NRI non-event = 0.31, p = 0.0023). IDI was also greatest for the combination (IDI = 0.04, p = 0.034), indicating enhanced discrimination between MASH and non-MASH individuals. In an external cohort, the elevation of plasma apoJ in MASH was consistently replicated, whereas apoL1, apoC-III, and apoE showed no such pattern. Plasma apoJ and apoL1 may serve as potential biomarkers for diagnosing MASH in individuals with obesity, independent of traditional risk factors.

41114371,A randomized trial of a multimodal lifestyle intervention in cancer survivors.,"Cancer survivors are often insufficiently physically active, have overweight or obesity, and suboptimal cardiorespiratory fitness. The Small Steps study evaluated a multimodal intervention to address these modifiable risk factors. The study randomized 33 cancer survivors to a 10-week multimodal lifestyle intervention (MLI) of exercise training and nutritional counseling or waitlist control (WLC). The co-primary endpoints included body weight and cardiorespiratory fitness capacity; secondary and exploratory endpoints included cardiometabolic and patient-reported measures. Endpoints were analyzed using analysis of covariance. Participants had a mean (SD) age of 60.3 (14.0) years, 26 (79%) were White, and 18 (55%) were survivors of breast cancer. At baseline, the mean body weight was 94.9 (18.3) kg, and the submaximal cardiopulmonary fitness was 16.4 (5.0) mL/kg/min. As compared with WLC, MLI reduced body weight [-2.3 kg (95% CI: -3.6, -0.9); P = 0.0013; -2.8% (95% CI: -4.3, -1.3)] and increased cardiopulmonary fitness [2.0 mL/kg/min (95% CI: 0.3, 3.8); P = 0.022].

41057045,Testing Theory-Enhanced Messaging to Promote COVID-19 Vaccination Among Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial.,"Uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine has been low in the United States despite ongoing public health recommendations. This has been linked to many factors, including pandemic fatigue; reduced risk perception; dis- and misinformation; and, more recently, symptoms of depression and anxiety. Novel communication and messaging strategies are one potential approach to promote vaccine uptake. This randomized controlled trial aimed to fill research gaps by testing the effect of 2 communication-based approaches<strong>-</strong>the use of a short attitudinal inoculation message and cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) kernel messaging<strong>-</strong>compared to standard public health messaging on vaccine uptake in a cohort of adult US residents. We completed a 3-arm, parallel-group, assessor-blinded stratified randomized trial between April 15, 2024, and May 2, 2024. Individuals were eligible if they were aged ≥18 years and (1) had received at least one dose of the COVID-19 vaccine but (2) had not received COVID-19 vaccine doses since September 11, 2023, and (3) had not been infected with SARS-CoV-2 in the previous 3 months. We purposively sampled eligible individuals with and without symptoms of anxiety and depression. Participants were randomly allocated to the (1) attitudinal inoculation intervention, (2) CBT kernel intervention, or (3) standard public health messaging intervention. By the 4-week follow-up, COVID-19 vaccination uptake was low overall (17/1403, 1.2%, 95% CI 0.6%-1.8%) and did not significantly differ by study arm<strong>-</strong>1.5% (7/469) in the CBT kernel arm (95% CI 0.4%-2.8%), 0.9% (4/466) in the inoculation arm (95% CI 0%-1.8%), and 1.3% (6/468) in the standard arm (95% CI 0.3%-2.4%). Compared to the standard arm, the CBT kernel intervention yielded a risk difference (RD) of 0.3% (95% CI -1.3% to 1.8%) and a risk ratio (RR) of 1.21 (95% CI 0.41-3.59); the inoculation intervention yielded an RD of -0.4% (95% CI -1.8% to 1%) and an RR of 0.69 (95% CI 0.19-2.44). Reported SARS-CoV-2 infections and vaccine uptake did not differ by anxiety or depression symptoms. At baseline, approximately one-third of participants (466/1403, 33.21%) reported high willingness to receive another COVID-19 vaccine dose, with no significant differences across arms. At the 4-week follow-up, willingness remained similar across groups (CBT kernel vs standard arm: RD=-0.3%, 95% CI -6.3% to 5.8%, and RR=0.99, 95% CI 0.79-1.25; inoculation vs standard arm: RD=7%, 95% CI 0.8%-13.3%, and RR=1.23, 95% CI 0.98-1.53). Willingness did not differ by mental health status. Successful efforts to increase uptake of the COVID-19 vaccine via theory-enhanced messaging remain elusive. Findings underscore the challenges of shifting behavior through messaging alone in a context of declining public trust and a diminished sense of urgency years after the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing research is needed to better understand and address informational and behavioral barriers to vaccination.

41073762,Development of the machine learning and deep learning models with SHAP strategy for predicting groundwater levels in South Korea.,"In this research, the groundwater levels (GWLs) were predicted by employing machine learning (i.e., stochastic gradient boosting (SGB), random forest (RF), generalized regression neural networks (GRNN), and group of method data handling (GMDH)) and deep learning (i.e., deep echo state network (Deep ESN) and long short-term memory (LSTM)) based on three predictive scenarios, Jeju Island, South Korea. In scenario 01, GWLs in Bongseong well was calculated utilizing rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and various GWLs in different wells. Based on scenario 02, GWLs in Bongseong well was calculated using rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and groundwater data (i.e., temperature, electric conductivity, and pressure). Finally, considering scenario 03, GWLs in Bongseong well were calculated by employing rainfall, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed, and GWLs from 1-day to 15-day lead time. Five evaluation measures, including root mean squared error (RMSE), correlation coefficient (CC), Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE), relative error (RE), and root relative squared error (RRSE), were reflected for the predictive accuracy of developed models. Results showed that RF3 (RMSE = 0.053 m, CC = 1.000, NSE = 1.000, RE = 1.114, and RRSE = 0.013) based on scenario 03 performed the best predictive accuracy in GWLs of Bongseong well. Furthermore, the additional contributions of this research were achieved by the enhanced comparative evaluation through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) strategy and one-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) test. The sensitivity analysis utilizing the SHAP strategy determined the significant feature indicator (i.e., GWL in 1-day lead-time) explaining its contribution to the predictive ability of developed models.

Acyl coenzyme A binding protein (ACBP, encoded by the gene diazepam binding inhibitor, Dbi) stimulates food intake and lipo-anabolic reactions. Here we found that plasma ACBP/DBI concentrations were elevated in patients and mice with Cushing's syndrome. We used several methods for ACBP/DBI inhibition in mice, namely, (1) induction of ACBP/DBI autoantibodies, (2) injection of a neutralizing monoclonal antibody, (3) body-wide or hepatocyte-specific knockout of the Dbi gene, (4) mutation of the ACBP/DBI receptor Gabrg2 and (5) injections of triiodothyronine or (6) the thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist resmetirom to block Dbi transcription. These six approaches abolished manifestations of Cushing's syndrome such as increased food intake, weight gain, excessive adiposity, liver damage, hypertriglyceridaemia and type 2 diabetes.

Since glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have been licensed for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus and obesity, they were one of the first drug classes to be examined in individuals with MASLD/MASH. Successful phase 2 randomised clinical trials with these agents have resulted in progression to phase 3 clinical trials (principally testing the long-term efficacy of subcutaneous semaglutide). Over the last few years, in addition to GLP-1RAs, newer agents with glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide and/or glucagon receptor agonist functions have been tested, with increasing evidence from phase 2 randomised clinical trials of histological improvements in MASLD/MASH, as well as benefits on MASLD-related extrahepatic complications. Based on this background of evidence, single, dual or triple incretin receptor agonists are becoming an attractive and promising treatment option for MASLD or MASH, particularly in individuals with coexisting obesity or type 2 diabetes mellitus. In this narrative review, we examine the rapidly expanding body of clinical evidence supporting a role of incretin-based pharmacotherapies in delaying or reversing MASH progression.

Adult male Wistar rats were utilized in this study and were divided (8/groups) into control, POIA-PE, HFD, HFD + POIA-PE (100, 200, and 300 mg/kg), and HFD + POIA-PE (300 mg/kg) + brusatol (2 mg/kg). Treatments with POIA-PE were given by gavage, orally, and for 12 weeks (thrice/week). POIA-PE, at all tested doses, not only reduced body and fat weights but also lowered fasting plasma glucose and insulin, serum and hepatic levels of triglycerides and cholesterol, and serum levels of LDL-c in HFD-fed rats. They also prevented the increase in levels of malondialdehyde, tumor necrosis factor-α, interleukin-6, caspase-3, Bax, and mRNA, as well as the nuclear levels of NF-κB, but stimulated the levels of Bcl-2, total glutathione, heme oxygenase-1, and superoxide dismutase (SOD) in the livers of HFD-fed rats. The increasing doses of POIA-PE also reduced the hepatic transcription of SREBP1, fatty acid synthase, and acetyl-CoA carboxylase and stimulated those of PPARα in HFD-fed rats. Mechanistically, POIA-PE reduced the mRNA and expression of Keap1 but increased the mRNA, cytoplasmic, and nuclear levels of Nrf2.

41134388,C6ORF120 regulates hepatic lipid metabolism through PPAR signaling pathway in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Background Emerging evidence indicates that C6ORF120 is highly expressed in the liver and may modulate immune responses in various hepatic disorders. However, its role in hepatic lipid metabolism and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is unexplored. This study aimed to elucidate the effects and potential mechanisms of C6ORF120 on hepatic lipogenesis. Methods C6ORF120 expression in MASLD was assessed using patient serum and the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. A high-fat diet-induced MASLD model was established in C6orf120-KO rats. Fatty acid-induced lipid accumulation models were generated in primary hepatocytes, HepG2 and Huh7 cells. These models were employed to investigate the effects of C6ORF120 on hepatic lipogenesis and MASLD progression. Results C6ORF120 expression was significantly upregulated in MASLD patients and obese rat models. Genetic deletion of C6ORF120 markedly alleviated high-fat diet-induced steatosis in the liver of rats. In vitro, C6orf120 gene deficiency attenuated lipid accumulation and suppressed key lipogenic genes (such as fatty acid synthase (Fasn), phospho-acetyl coenzyme carboxylase (p-ACC), sterol regulatory element binding protein-1c (Srebp1c)) in primary hepatocytes and HepG2 cells. Conversely, C6ORF120 overexpression increased lipid accumulation in HepG2 cells. RNA sequencing analysis showed that lipid metabolism pathway and peroxisome proliferators activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway were significantly altered in the liver of C6orf120-KO rats. We demonstrated that C6ORF120 may regulate lipid metabolism through the hepatic PPARα, which is involved in fatty acid production and lipid oxidation. Further, we found that serum C6ORF120 expression was correlated with clinical indicators in patients with MASLD. Conclusion This study preliminarily revealed a novel function for C6ORF120 in hepatic lipid metabolism via affecting the PPAR pathway. The result identifies C6ORF120 as a novel regulator of hepatic lipid metabolism through PPARα-dependent mechanisms, offering potential therapeutic targets for MASLD.",2025,Oct,Functional & integrative genomics,Peng Wang; Jian Zhang; Xin Wang; Hui Liu; Yunyun Yi; Yali Liu; Jing Zhang; Xin Li,2112,True,2025-10-01

First of all, to realize robust vGNE computation under EL system with general bounded disturbances, a novel disturbance observer is introduced into the vGSNA to enhance the capacity of disturbance rejection. Second, detailed stability analysis is conducted via the Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals to show the convergence of the players' actions to the vGNE under general bounded time-varying delays. Finally, to testify the efficiency of the vGSNA, an electricity market game based on generator-turbine system is presented.",2025,Oct,Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society,Jianing Chen; Shuangyu Liu; Yuhan Xue; Sitian Qin,851,True,2025-10-01
41063983,MyD88 orchestrates fatty acid metabolism in tumor-associated macrophages and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease-related hepatocarcinogenesis.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing cause of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Toll-like receptors (TLRs) and their adapter protein, myeloid differentiation factor 88 (MyD88), are activated in NAFLD and contribute to its development. However, the specific role of MyD88 in myeloid cells that regulate NAFLD-associated hepatocarcinogenesis remains unknown. We used a diethylnitrosamine/high-fat diet-induced HCC mouse model with selective deletion of MyD88 from myeloid cells to investigate NAFLD-HCC, and we evaluated the development of NAFLD-HCC histologically and genetically. Myeloid cell MyD88-deficient (Lyz MyD88 in macrophages has a promotional role in NAFLD-associated HCC. MyD88 promotes macrophage M2 polarization, which enhances the progression of NAFLD to HCC by activating the SREBP1/STAT6 pathway.

41016550,"Gradually, then Suddenly: Nutrition in an Era of Medically Induced Weight Loss.","For decades, nutrition science and the food industry have confronted the seemingly intractable problem of chronic energy imbalance, leading to overweight and obesity, with behavioral- and product-based interventions yielding modest and inconsistent effects on body weight. The emergence of next-generation emerging obesity medications-exemplified by glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists-represents a rare paradigm shift in helping individuals achieve and maintain body weight control. We propose a conceptual transformation for nutrition that parallels that of physical activity. Research strongly supports physical activity for its profound health benefits independent of its modest role in weight loss. The same is true for nutrition. With the overwhelming noise of energy imbalance attenuated, the signals from specific nutritional properties-such as fatty acid profiles, fiber content, and protein quality-can emerge as clearer drivers of health outcomes, guiding both targeted research and product reformulation efforts. This new era elevates the value proposition of nutrition, freeing the field to focus resources on questions that nutrition science is better equipped to answer and that the food industry is better able to enact.",2025,Sep,The Journal of nutrition,Robert E Bergia; Eric M Davis; Wayne W Campbell,1243,True,2025-09-01
41103501,Metabolic syndrome: risk factors and molecular drug targets.,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS), is a non-communicable disorder caused by impaired management and storage of energy, primarily associated with unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyles and stress. It is diagnosed when any three of the following conditions are observed, obesity (primary factor), hyperglycemia, low HDL, hypertriglyceridemia, and hypertension (ATP III guidelines). MetS affects approximately 14-34 % of the global population, highlighting significant public health concern. If left untreated, it leads to the development of other serious metabolic diseases like atherosclerosis, diabetes, PCOS, NAFLD, NASH, thyroid, cancer, sleep disturbance, osteoarthritis, anxiety, and depression. Despite ongoing research, no first-line drug currently exists for the comprehensive management of MetS. Its multifactorial nature often requires lifelong polytherapy with lifestyle intervention, raising concern over chronic drug use, drug-drug interactions, increasing morbidity and mortality. Therefore, there is a need highlighting the requirement of a single and targeted pharmacotherapy which offers a safer and more specific therapeutic approach. This review aims to identify and analyse ten key molecular targets in managing the pathogenesis of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). These targets can further pave the way for a targeted and safer approach in the treatment of MetS.

This meta-analysis aimed to summarize the efficiency and safety of resmetirom in treating NASH. Electronic databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of resmetirom vs placebo in patients with NASH. The primary outcomes were the changes from baseline in hepatic fat content, liver histology, including NASH resolution, and noninvasive markers of hepatic fibrosis. Three randomized controlled trials (n = 2231) met the inclusion criteria. Compared to placebo, resmetirom achieved greater reductions from baseline in hepatic fat content assessed by magnetic resonance imaging proton density fat fraction (for resmetirom 80 mg: MD -27.76% [95%CI: -32.84, -22.69]; for resmetirom 100 mg: MD -36.01% [95%CI: -41.54, -30.48]; P < .00001 for both) and FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (for resmetirom 80 mg: MD -21.45 dBm [95%CI: -29.37, -13.52]; for resmetirom 100 mg: MD -25.51 dBm [95%CI: -33.53, -17.49]; P < .00001 for both). Resmetirom 80 mg outperformed placebo in NASH resolution and ≥2-point nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score reduction. Moreover, resmetirom 80 mg and 100 mg were superior to placebo in cytokeratin-18 (M30) reduction. Greater reductions in liver enzymes, lipids, and reverse triiodothyronine were observed in the resmetirom arms with no impact on triiodothyronine.

41117588,The assessment of non-inferiority of oral vs. subcutaneous semaglutide: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to comprehensively compare oral and subcutaneous semaglutide for type 2 diabetes.  The aim of the study was to determine whether oral semaglutide is non-inferior to the subcutaneous, assess potential superiority, and provide evidence-based guidance for clinical decisions.  We searched clinical trial registries and bibliographic databases through April 30, 2025. Twelve randomized controlled trials involving 6253 adults with type 2 diabetes were analyzed. Following PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines (PROSPERO CRD420251017953), data were extracted on efficacy, safety, and clinical outcomes. Non-inferiority was assessed using predefined margins; post hoc superiority analyses examined secondary endpoints. Evidence certainty was evaluated using GRADE.  Both formulations of semaglutide significantly reduced HbA1c: oral by -1.16 percentage points (95% CI, -1.22--1.09) and subcutaneous by -1.40 percentage points (95% CI, -1.47--1.33). Oral semaglutide met the non-inferiority margin at 50% of the subcutaneous effect. Subcutaneous semaglutide was superior for weight loss (-2.19 kg; 95% CI, -3.57--0.81; P <0.01), BMI reduction (-0.88 kg/m2; 95% CI, -1.55--0.21; P <0.05), and triglyceride lowering (-0.09 mmol/L; 95% CI, -0.14--0.04; P <0.001).  Both forms of semaglutide effectively improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes. Oral semaglutide is non-inferior in lowering HbA1c, while subcutaneous semaglutide is superior in weight, BMI, and triglyceride reductions.

39152636,Beneficial effects of MGL-3196 and BAM15 combination in a mouse model of fatty liver disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a metabolic disorder with limited treatment options. The thyroid hormone receptor (THR)-β agonist resmetirom/MGL-3196 (MGL) increases liver fat oxidation and has been approved for treating adult MASH. However, over 60% of patients receiving MGL treatment do not achieve MASH resolution. Therefore, we investigated the potential for combination therapy of MGL with the mitochondrial uncoupler BAM15 to improve fatty liver disease outcomes in the GAN mouse model of MASH. C57BL/6J male mice were fed GAN diet for 38 weeks before stratification and randomization to treatments including MGL, BAM15, MGL + BAM15, or no drug control for 8 weeks. Treatments were admixed in diet and mice were pair-fed to control for drug intake. Treatment effectiveness was assessed by body weight, body composition, energy expenditure, glucose tolerance, tissue lipid content, and histological analyses. MGL + BAM15 treatment resulted in better efficacy versus GAN control mice than either monotherapy in the context of energy expenditure, liver fat loss, glucose control, and fatty liver disease activity score. Improvements in ALT, liver mass, and plasma cholesterol were primarily driven by MGL, while improvements in body fat were primarily driven by BAM15. No treatments altered liver fibrosis. MGL + BAM15 treatment had overall better efficacy to improve metabolic outcomes in mice fed GAN diet than either monotherapy alone. These data warrant further investigation into combination therapies of THR-β agonists and mitochondrial uncouplers for the potential treatment of disorders related to fatty liver, obesity, and insulin resistance.",2024,Oct,"Acta physiologica (Oxford, England)",Mingyan Zhou; Catherine Li; Frances L Byrne; Calum S Vancuylenburg; Ellen M Olzomer; Adam Hargreaves; Lindsay E Wu; Nicholas A Shackel; Webster L Santos; Kyle L Hoehn,1683,True,2024-10-01
41075932,NSD2 exacerbates metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease progression by suppressing TFEB-mediated autophagy-lysosomal pathway.,"Impaired autophagy is increasingly recognized as a key contributor to the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). However, its underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely undefined. Emerging evidence implicates epigenetic regulators in modulating autophagic pathways in metabolic diseases. Therefore, this study aimed to elucidate the role of a histone methyltransferase, nuclear receptor binding SET domain protein 2 (NSD2), in regulating autophagy and its contribution to MASLD progression. NSD2 expression levels were evaluated in liver tissues from patients with MASLD and mouse models. Functional studies were conducted using hepatocyte-specific Nsd2 knockout and overexpression mouse models, along with cleavage under targets and tagmentation analysis in hepatocyte cell lines. Additionally, the effects of pharmacological NSD2 inhibition using NSC663284 were evaluated in human liver organoids. Autophagy, hepatic steatosis, and related epigenetic changes were assessed through molecular and histological techniques. NSD2 expression was markedly elevated in both patient livers and murine models, correlating positively with disease severity. Hepatic NSD2 deficiency alleviated diet-induced autophagy impairment and steatosis, while NSD2 overexpression exacerbated these pathologies. Mechanistically, NSD2 epigenetically suppressed TFEB transcription by promoting trimethylation of histone H4 at lysine 20, impairing autophagy. Pharmacological inhibition of NSD2 with NSC663284 similarly alleviated hepatic steatosis in human liver organoids. NSD2 acts as a key epigenetic suppressor of TFEB-mediated autophagy in the liver, promoting lipid accumulation and MASLD progression. Targeting NSD2 represents a promising therapeutic strategy for MASLD.",2025,Oct,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,Yuan Qiao; Yijia Zhang; Cuiting Sun; Qi Jin; Peng Qu; Zecheng Li; Yang Qiu; Hua Meng; Dantao Peng; Liang Peng,1799,True,2025-10-01

The study sample consisted of twenty-five (N = 25) community-dwelling adults residing in rural Missouri counties. Researchers conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews and applied thematic analysis techniques to interpret the data. Results indicated that participants often viewed pain as a limitation and associated its experience and treatment with weakness. Their attitudes toward pharmacological pain management were influenced by a prevalent social stigma surrounding pain medications (particularly opioid analgesics), fear of losing control, and a general aversion to medications. In contrast, their attitudes toward non-pharmacological pain management were decidedly positive. Participants expressed a strong preference for natural interventions and emphasized preventive measures to manage pain. Study findings support previously published research suggesting that rural individuals may minimize medical interventions and prioritize self-sufficiency. To address these cultural norms effectively, a strong clinician-patient relationship and multimodal pain management approaches that incorporate non-opioid strategies are recommended.",2025,Oct,Health & place,Karla T Washington; Klaudia Kukulka; Archana Bharadwaj; Olivia J Landon; Masako Mayahara; Jacquelyn J Benson,1309,True,2025-10-01

40577015,Value-Based Pricing of Resmetirom for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"Resmetirom can slow fibrosis progression and improve resolution of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). As the first Food and Drug Administration-approved pharmacologic treatment for MASH and fibrosis stages F2 and F3, resmetirom is very expensive, potentially creating a financial barrier to patient access. To estimate the cost-effectiveness of resmetirom vs standard of care (SoC) over a lifetime and to determine a price threshold at which resmetirom would be cost-effective. This economic evaluation used an agent-based state-transition microsimulation model with a yearly cycle and 14 distinct histologically defined health states: metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MALSD) or F0, MASH, fibrosis stages F1 to F3 with or without MASH, cirrhosis, decompensated cirrhosis, liver cancer, liver transplant, and liver-related and other-cause death. The simulated cohort included US adults who entered the model with MASH and fibrosis stage F2 or F3. The study was conducted from March to December 2024. Resmetirom vs SoC. Costs (in 2023 US dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) (calculated as incremental costs divided by incremental QALYs). A cohort of 200 000 patients (mean [SD] age, 57.1 [10.5] years; 89 000 [44.5%] male; 132 600 [66.2%] with MASH-F3) was simulated. Compared with SoC, resmetirom was associated with a gain of 0.26 QALYs/patient. Lifetime drug cost was $54 754, and treatment saved $18 499 in MASLD-related medical costs for a total incremental cost of $36 255 per patient. The ICER was $140 134/QALY. At willingness-to-pay (WTP) thresholds of $50 000/QALY, $100 000/QALY, and $150 000/QALY, the maximal annual prices of resmetirom were $10 914, $15 406, and $19 879, respectively. The lower the discontinuation rate, the greater the cost-effectiveness and medical cost savings, but the higher the total treatment costs. Without discontinuation, the ICER would be $318 740/QALY, supporting a price between $5645 and $10 619 per year at WTP thresholds of $50 000/QALY and $150 000/QALY, respectively. In this economic evaluation, resmetirom was not cost-effective at a $100 000/QALY WTP threshold. The conclusion was sensitive to model assumptions, especially the discontinuation rate.

41135791,Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction and Chronic Kidney Disease - from pathophysiology to treatment.,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is an increasingly prevalent subtype of heart failure. It is characterized by a heterogeneous clinical phenotype, a less understood pathophysiology, and multifactorial etiologies. A frequent comorbidity of HFpEF is chronic kidney disease (CKD). The cardiorenal phenotype in HFpEF is growing in prevalence and represents a high-risk clinical population. HFpEF and CKD are interconnected through complex, bidirectional processes involving systemic inflammation, neurohormonal activation, hemodynamic changes, and iron deficiency. These overlapping processes, along with common risk factors, exacerbate disease presentation and progression, contributing to significantly worse outcomes, including higher rates of hospitalization, mortality, and progression to end-stage kidney disease. Historically, treatment options for HFpEF have been limited, but recent studies have identified agents with both cardiovascular and renal benefits. Emerging therapies, such as SGLT2 inhibitors, non-steroidal MRAs, and GLP-1 receptor agonists, offer a new hope for improving outcomes in the HFpEF cardiorenal population.

41153354,Characteristic Gene Alterations During Fatty Acid Metabolism in the Goose Liver.,"The development of hepatic steatosis in geese is a complex, multistage process involving genes related to lipid synthesis, transport, storage, and metabolism. Key genes activated during this process include ME1 (malic enzyme 1), SCD1 (stearoyl-CoA desaturase), ACSL1 (acyl-CoA synthetase long-chain family member 1), and ELOVL6 (elongation of very-long-chain fatty acids protein 6). The expression of these genes varies depending on the tissue, breed, and metabolic context. Geese possess a unique ability to develop hepatic steatosis (fatty liver) without accompanying inflammation or liver damage. This condition typically arises from overfeeding, either through carbohydrates or fats, leading to significant triglyceride accumulation in hepatocytes. Importantly, this state remains reversible and is considered non-pathological. The physiological and molecular changes observed in overfed geese, particularly regarding liver lipid accumulation and serum enzyme activity, closely resemble those found in human non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). This similarity makes geese an excellent biomedical model for studying NAFLD. Overfeeding initiates a cascade of enzymatic reactions that regulate lipid metabolism at the genetic level. These reactions decrease circulating free fatty acids and glucose while promoting triglyceride storage in the liver. The aim of this study is to synthesize current knowledge on the genetic regulation of fatty acid metabolism in geese, highlighting how these genes coordinate the processes of activation, desaturation, synthesis, and elongation during induced steatosis.

37995806,Advances in obesity pharmacotherapy; learning from metabolic surgery and beyond.,"Currently, metabolic surgery (MS) constitutes the most effective means for durable weight loss of clinically meaningful magnitude, type 2 diabetes remission and resolution of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as other obesity-related comorbidities. Accumulating evidence on the mechanisms through which MS exerts its actions has highlighted the altered secretion of hormonally active peptides of intestinal origin with biological actions crucial to energy metabolism as key drivers of MS clinical effects. The initial success of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists regarding weight loss and metabolic amelioration have been followed by the development of unimolecular dual and triple polyagonists, additionally exploiting the effects of glucagon and/or glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) which achieves a magnitude of weight loss approximating that of common MS operations. Through the implementation of such therapies, the feasibility of a ""medical bypass"", namely the replication of the clinical effects of MS through non-surgical interventions may be foreseeable in the near future. Apart from weight loss, this approach ought to be put to the test also regarding other clinical outcomes, such as liver steatosis and steatohepatitis, cardiovascular disease, and overall prognosis, on which MS has a robustly demonstrated impact. Besides, a medical bypass as an alternative, salvage, or combination strategy to MS may promote precision medicine in obesity therapeutics.",2024,Feb,Metabolism: clinical and experimental,Dimitrios Tsilingiris; Alexander Kokkinos,1507,True,2024-02-01
40992788,"If the evidence is there, why are GLP-1 receptor agonists not on-label for hip and knee osteoarthritis in overweight patients?","Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have rapidly emerged as highly effective pharmacological tools for weight management, with additional cardiometabolic benefits extending beyond obesity and diabetes. Despite compelling evidence, their potential role in osteoarthritis (OA) remains unrecognized in current regulatory frameworks. Hip and knee OA, leading causes of disability and healthcare burden worldwide, are strongly influenced by both biomechanical overload and systemic metabolic-inflammatory pathways. Increasing data support the dual capacity of GLP-1 RAs to achieve clinically meaningful weight reduction and to exert direct anti-inflammatory and chondroprotective effects within the joint. The STEP 9 trial and complementary real-world evidence demonstrate substantial improvements in OA symptoms, paralleled by reductions in surgical risk, while ongoing trials such as STOP-KNEE OA will further clarify their structural impact. Importantly, patients with a body mass index (BMI) of 27-29.9 kg/m²-currently excluded from GLP-1 RA eligibility unless additional comorbidities are present-may particularly benefit, as weight loss beyond 7-10% appears necessary to meaningfully alter OA trajectories. Recognizing symptomatic hip and knee OA as weight-related comorbidities would align regulatory labels with emerging science, expand therapeutic access, and foster integrated management of musculoskeletal and metabolic diseases. This Viewpoint argues that failure to acknowledge OA as an on-label indication for GLP-1 RAs represents a missed opportunity for patients, clinicians, and health systems.",2025,Sep,RMD open,Francesco Ursini; Jacopo Ciaffi; Roberto Caporali,1625,True,2025-09-01
41022269,GLP-1 receptor agonists and sarcopenia: Weight loss at a cost? A brief narrative review.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) and dual agonists targeting both GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptors (GLP-1/GIP RAs) are established therapies for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and obesity. However, there is evidence that treatment with these agents may lead to significant loss of muscle mass, potentially resulting in sarcopenia or sarcopenic obesity. This brief narrative review explores the complex relationship between GLP-1 based therapies and muscle health. Some studies have linked GLP-1 RAs and dual GLP-1/GIP RAs with significant reductions in lean mass, and sarcopenia. However, preclinical evidence suggests that these agents can attenuate skeletal muscle atrophy, improve muscle function, and enhance mitochondrial health. Moreover, limited clinical data indicate a potential role in preserving muscle mass under certain conditions. Management includes optimised diet, targeted exercise, and novel pharmacological interventions, such as blockade of growth differentiation factor-8 (GDF8) and activin A (ActA). These measures hold potential to preserve muscle mass and to improve patient outcomes. Further research is warranted to clarify these mechanisms and to evaluate combination therapies aimed at preventing sarcopenia in patients receiving GLP-1 RAs.",2025,Nov,Diabetes research and clinical practice,Dimitrios Pantazopoulos; Evanthia Gouveri; Dimitrios Papazoglou; Nikolaos Papanas,1323,True,2025-11-01
41067318,Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides alleviate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by modulating gut microbiota against TLR4/NF-κB/MAPK pathway and activating AMPK pathway.,"Ganoderma lucidum (Leyss. ex Fr.) Karst has been a revered traditional Chinese medicinal herb, widely used in folk medicine to treat various metabolic diseases due to its remarkable bioactivities. Among its active components, G. lucidum polysaccharides are particularly recognized as one of the main contributors to its therapeutic effects. However, the therapeutic efficacy of G. lucidum polysaccharides against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and its underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated. This study aimed to assess the therapeutic efficacy of a novel polysaccharide (EPGLa) derived from G. lucidum in the treatment of NAFLD and to elucidate its underlying mechanisms. The chemical characterization of the isolated and purified EPGLa was conducted using monosaccharide composition analysis, Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy, molecular weight determination, methylation analysis, and 1D/2D nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Following the establishment of a NAFLD mouse model, the therapeutic effect of EPGLa on NAFLD was assessed, and its underlying mechanism was clarified. The backbone of EPGLa consists of the following glycosidic linkages: →6)-β-D-Glcp-(1→, →3)-β-D-Glcp-(1→, →4,6)-α-D-Glcp-(1→, →3,6)-β-D-Manp-(1→, →2)-α-D-Manp-(1→, and →4)-β-D-Galp-(1 → . Its branches are composed of β-D-Glcp-(1→, β-D-Glcp-(1 → 3)-β-D-Glcp-(1→, and α-L-Fucp-(1 → . In vivo results demonstrated that EPGLa effectively alleviated NAFLD by promoting the growth of beneficial gut bacteria to repair the intestinal barrier against Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)/toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)/nuclear factor kappa B (NF-κB)/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, and simultaneously enhancing short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) production to activate the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) pathway. To further validate these findings, we employed fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT), which confirmed the role of EPGLa in modulating gut microbiota against NAFLD. Our study provides compelling evidence that EPGLa holds promise as a potential therapeutic agent for the intervention of NAFLD, and our findings also offer novel insights into the therapeutic targets of other bioactive polysaccharides.",2025,Oct,Journal of ethnopharmacology,Huajie Zhao; Yun Li; Ningning Liu; Ping Chen; Xiaojie Yu; Guofang Li; Baoguo Deng; Duan Li; Fan Yang; Ge Wang,2233,True,2025-10-01

Dietary fatty acids including oleic (OA) and palmitic acids (PA) contribute to the hepatic intracellular triglyceride accumulation, and are therefore thought to play key roles in disease development and progression. Taking advantage of the cutting-edge organ-on-chip technology that mimics the 3D organ dynamic environment, we aimed at investigating the role of OA, PA and a 2:1 OA/PA mixture on the growth and function of the HepG2/C3A, a liver cell line model, over 2 and 7 days. OA supported sustained cell growth, leading to dense 3D tissues, whereas PA and OA exposure did not affect cell proliferation. PA treatment downregulated the GLUT2, INSRA, SREBP1, FASN, mRNA levels indicating a lipid metabolism perturbation in our model. The cell dysfunction caused by OA, PA, and OA/PA was associated with an increase in reactive oxygen species (ROS) production over time.

We emulated a target trial using claims data of adults with T2D at moderate cardiovascular risk who initiated dulaglutide, exenatide, liraglutide, or semaglutide between 01/01/2014-12/31/2021. Random treatment assignment was emulated by propensity scores and incorporated into inverse probability of treatment weighted (IPTW) Cox models. Outcomes were time to composite major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE: myocardial infarction, stroke, and all-cause mortality), expanded MACE (MACE, hospitalization for heart failure, and revascularization) and its components, and severe hypoglycemia.

41103643,"Multi-omics analysis of hepatic outcomes in T2DM-MAFLD patients treated with semaglutide: a single-centre, longitudinal, data-driven study.","Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease and is closely linked to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The pathogenesis of MAFLD involves complex metabolic imbalances, including impaired fatty acid β-oxidation and chronic inflammation. GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have shown promise in improving metabolic outcomes, but their specific effects on MAFLD remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the hepatic benefits of semaglutide, a GLP-1 RA, in T2DM patients with MAFLD using serum proteomics and metabolomics. We conducted a single-centre, longitudinal, data-driven study involving 75 T2DM patients with MAFLD (pre-treatment, PT) and 100 healthy controls (health control, HC). Patients received semaglutide treatment (0.25 mg/week initially, escalated to 0.5 mg/week) for 12 weeks. Serum proteomic and metabolomic profiles were analyzed using 4D-DIA proteomics and LC-MS before and after treatment. Biomarker discovery involved the identification of differential metabolites and proteins, pathway analysis, and integration of proteomic and metabolomic data. Clinical and biochemical parameters were also assessed. Semaglutide significantly improved metabolic and liver parameters, including HbA1c, BMI, HOMA-IR, liver function, IL-6, and liver stiffness (p < 0.01). Multivariate analysis revealed distinct proteomic and metabolomic profiles between baseline and post-treatment groups. A total of 203 differential metabolites and 61 proteins were identified, with key changes including reductions in long-chain fatty acids and inflammatory mediators, alongside increases in carnitine derivatives and anti-inflammatory proteins. Pathway analysis highlighted effects on fatty acid metabolism, PPAR signaling, and NAFLD-related pathways. Our study provides a comprehensive multi-omics analysis revealing that semaglutide modulates serum proteomic and metabolomic profiles in T2DM-MAFLD patients, potentially through enhancing mitochondrial β-oxidation, reducing lipid toxicity, and suppressing inflammation. These findings offer mechanistic insights into the hepatic benefits of semaglutide and support its potential as a therapeutic agent for MAFLD. This innovative approach advances our understanding of GLP-1 RAs' multi-organ protective effects and provides a foundation for developing precision medicine strategies for MAFLD.",2025,01,Frontiers in endocrinology,Shu Niu; Shuchun Chen; Di Wu; Chenxi Wang; Jianchao Xu; Jiantong Yin; Yubin Zhao,2425,True,2025-01-01
41107482,Human genetics of steatotic liver disease: insights into insulin resistance and lipid metabolism.,"Metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD, previously known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease or NAFLD) is a prevalent and heterogeneous condition affecting nearly 30% of the global population. MASLD is defined as excessive hepatic lipid accumulation with at least one feature of insulin resistance, with potential progression to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. The disease often coexists with insulin resistance and cardiovascular and chronic kidney diseases. Human genetics has shed light on MASLD predisposition and its causal association with type 2 diabetes and insulin resistance, enabling the field to progress towards precision-medicine therapeutics. Convergent selection of somatic mutations in genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism in cirrhotic livers suggests adaptive responses to gluco-lipotoxicity that influence end-stage liver disease.

Historically, treatment options for patients with more advanced stages of hepatic dysfunction (steatohepatitis, fibrosis, cirrhosis) have been limited, with only resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist, recently being approved for use as a metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH)-specific treatment option. Incretin-based receptor agonists are emerging as promising treatments for MASLD, and multiple liver-biopsy powered trials are underway. This group of drugs has gained attention as possible treatment options for MASLD/MASH, due to their significant weight-loss and body fat reduction effects, and there is also a growing body of evidence that incretin-based agents lead to a significant reduction in liver fat content. However, the evidence concerning improvement of steatohepatitis and/or fibrosis is limited. Most authorities consider incretin mimetics to be only one contributing factor to the treatment paradigm of the MASLD/MASH/ fibrosis/cirrhosis continuum. Specifically, according to the data to date, incretin-based treatments may improve metabolic abnormalities in MASLD/MASH patients, especially in patients with obesity and/or T2DM, and may mitigate its progression at the early stages. However, no incretin-based treatment is officially approved in this indication yet.

41010881,Rethinking the Diabetes-Cardiovascular Disease Continuum: Toward Integrated Care.,"Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are not merely coexisting epidemics but co-evolving manifestations of a shared cardiometabolic continuum. Despite advances in glycemic, lipid, and blood pressure control, residual cardiovascular risk remains high, underscoring the limitations of siloed approaches. In this perspective, we argue for reframing T2D and CVD as interconnected conditions driven by inflammation, adipose tissue dysfunction, and organ crosstalk. Beyond metformin, which remains foundational, several glucose-lowering drug classes are now evaluated not only for glycemic control but also for their cardiovascular and renal impact. Landmark trials and recent meta-analyses confirm that sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists improve cardiorenal outcomes. More recently, tirzepatide, a dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptor agonist, has shown unprecedented efficacy in weight and glucose management, with potential to further transform cardiometabolic risk reduction. Yet enthusiasm for these therapies must be tempered by heterogeneity of response, treatment costs, and inequitable access. Integrated care models, supported by multidisciplinary teams, digital health tools, and value-based reimbursement, are essential to close the gap between trial efficacy and real-world outcomes. Attention to sex, age, ethnicity, and comorbidity profiles is critical to ensure equity, as is the adaptation of strategies to low- and middle-income countries where the burden of cardiometabolic disease is rapidly rising. Ultimately, advancing cardiometabolic medicine requires not only novel therapies but also a unifying framework that integrates biology, behavior, economics, and health systems to deliver the right treatment to the right patient at the right time.",2025,Sep,Journal of clinical medicine,Alfredo Caturano; Cassandra Morciano; Katarzyna Zielińska; Vincenzo Russo; Marco Alfonso Perrone; Cesare Celeste Berra; Caterina Conte,1884,True,2025-09-01

This study investigates the effects of preoperative probiotic supplementation on inflammation, endotoxemia, adipokines, and gastrointestinal peptides after bariatric surgery. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial included patients undergoing laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy (LSG) or one anastomosis gastric bypass (OAGB). Participants were randomized to receive a 12-week supplementation of either a probiotic mixture, Sanprobi Barrier, which contained nine strains of bacteria (Bifidobacterium bifidum W23, Bifidobacterium lactis W51 and W52, Lactobacillus acidophilus W37, Levilactobacillus brevis W63, Lacticaseibacillus casei W56, Ligilactobacillus salivarius W24, Lactococcus lactis W19, and Lactococcus lactis W58), or a placebo before surgery. The key outcomes measured at baseline and 6 months postoperatively included serum lipopolysaccharide (LPS), cytokines (interleukin-6 - IL-6, interleukin-2 receptor-IL-2R, and C-reactive-CRP protein), adipokines (leptin, adiponectin, resistin), and gastrointestinal peptides (glucagon-like peptide-1 - GLP-1, ghrelin, and trefoil factor 2). Relative mRNA expression of ghrelin and trefoil family factor 2 in gastric tissues was also analyzed at baseline and on the day of the surgery. Out of the initial 110 participants, serum samples of 18 individuals in the probiotic group and 24 in the placebo group were analyzed. Both groups showed significant reductions in serum LPS levels six months after surgery; however, no significant differences were observed between the two groups. Adiponectin levels increased significantly in the placebo group (4.2 ± 2.3 vs. 2.2 ± 1.1 pg/mL; p < 0.001), while leptin levels decreased significantly in both groups without intergroup differences. IL-6 levels were significantly lower in the probiotic group compared to the placebo group at 6 months (2.2 ± 1.1 vs 4.2 ± 2.3 pg/mL; p = 0.004). No significant differences were observed in the remaining cytokine levels between the groups. Gastrointestinal peptides showed no significant differences between the groups, although GLP-1 levels improved within both groups. No changes were observed in ghrelin and trefoil factor 2 expression at the mRNA level. Preoperative probiotic therapy was associated with significantly lower IL-6 levels compared to placebo six months after surgery, suggesting a potential anti-inflammatory effect. However, since the between-group difference in IL-6 changes from baseline was not statistically significant, the observed effect should be interpreted with caution. Other measured markers were not significantly affected, though low statistical power may have limited detection of subtle effects. These findings suggest that while probiotics may reduce certain inflammatory responses, their efficacy can be overshadowed by bariatric surgery impact.

41088738,Gastric Emptying Delay with Pre-Meal Administration of Metformin and Anagliptin in Type 2 Diabetes: Effects on Postprandial Glucose and Triglyceride Levels in a Two-Case Report.,"BACKGROUND Metformin is a treatment for type 2 diabetes and has been reported to reduce plasma triglyceride levels in addition to plasma glucose levels. We recently reported that the administration of metformin before fat loading reduces the postprandial triglyceride concentration and slows gastric emptying in an animal model. We confirmed that pre-meal administration of metformin reduces the postprandial triglyceride concentration in the pilot clinical study. Metformin is known to increase glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion, and we hypothesized that its combination with a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, which prevents the inactivation of GLP-1 in the blood, would enhance the delayed effect of gastric peristaltic emptying. To prove this hypothesis, we initiated a clinical trial to examine the effects of pre- and post-meal administration of a combination tablet of metformin and anagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, on glucose and lipid metabolism and gastric emptying measured using 13C-acetate (jRCTs051200098). However, because the trial had to be terminated due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we report the details of the 2 patients for whom data were obtained. CASE REPORT Both cases showed that pre-meal administration of metformin and anagliptin reduced the postprandial triglyceride concentrations and increased active GLP-1 levels, compared with post-meal administration. In addition, gastric emptying was delayed with pre-meal administration of metformin and anagliptin. CONCLUSIONS Pre-meal administration of metformin and anagliptin reduced postprandial glucose and triglyceride concentrations, potentially through a delay in gastric emptying. Thus, changing the timing of medication may improve their therapeutic effects.",2025,Oct,The American journal of case reports,Koichiro Murata; Daisuke Sato; Katsutaro Morino; Shogo Ida; Natsuko Ohashi; Daisuke Takenaka; Natsuko Kitagawa; Mayu Shigemi; Itsuko Miyazawa; Tsuyoshi Yanagimachi; Yukihiro Fujita; Hiroshi Maegawa; Shinji Kume,1752,True,2025-10-01

The outcome was the estimated 6-year risk of MASLD determined by the Framingham Fatty Liver Disease Risk Function. Multivariable linear and multinomial regression models were used and adjusted for baseline covariates at the time of the OGTT, including study field center, age, parity, gestational age, and duration from enrollment to follow-up. Of 4,697 assessed pregnant individuals, the median age was 30.5 years (interquartile range 26.0, 34.1 years) and the median body mass index was 26.6 (interquartile range 24.1, 29.9); 14.3% (n=672) were diagnosed with GDM. At 10-14 years after delivery (median 11.6 years, interquartile range 10.8, 12.4 years), the median estimated 6-year risk of MASLD was 6.0% (interquartile 3.0%, 13.0%). Individuals with a higher third trimester glucose summary z-score were at higher estimated risk of postpartum MASLD (adjusted beta coefficient 3.2 per 1 SD; 95% CI, 2.7-3.6), as were those who were diagnosed with GDM (adjusted beta coefficient 4.2%; 95% CI, 3.1-5.2). When MASLD risk was assessed in tertiles, an increase of 1 SD in the summary z-score was associated with greater adjusted odds of being in the highest-risk MASLD tertile (adjusted odds ratio 1.1; 95% CI, 1.0-1.3); however, a diagnosis of GDM was not associated with greater adjusted odds of being in the highest-risk MASLD tertile. Increasing pregnancy dysglycemia in the third trimester was associated with a higher estimated risk of postpartum MASLD using cardiometabolic risk factors measured 10-14 years after delivery. Whether postpartum interventions to improve cardiometabolic health for individuals with prior pregnancy dysglycemia decreases the risk of MASLD requires further investigation.",2025,Oct,O&G open,Christine Field; Lanla F Conteh; Jiqiang Wu; Vidya Mullangi; Patrick Catalano; Mark B Landon; Denise M Scholtens; William L Lowe; William A Grobman; Kartik K Venkatesh,2335,True,2025-10-01
36910628,Potential use of TG68 - A novel thyromimetic - for the treatment of non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFLD)-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.,"Several lines of evidence suggest that the thyroid hormone signaling pathway is altered in patients with NAFLD and that pharmacological strategies to target the thyroid hormone/thyroid hormone nuclear receptor axis (TH/THR) in the liver may exert beneficial effects. In this study, we investigated the effect of TG68, a novel THRβ agonist, on rat hepatic fat accumulation and NAFLD-associated hepatocarcinogenesis. Male rats given a single dose of diethylnitrosamine (DEN) and fed a high fat diet (HFD) were co-treated with different doses of TG68. Systemic and hepatic metabolic parameters, immunohistochemistry and hepatic gene expression were determined to assess the effect of TG68 on THRβ activation. Irrespectively of the dose, treatment with TG68 led to a significant reduction in liver weight, hepatic steatosis, circulating triglycerides, cholesterol and blood glucose. Importantly, a short exposure to TG68 caused regression of DEN-induced preneoplastic lesions associated with a differentiation program, as evidenced by a loss of neoplastic markers and reacquisition of markers of differentiated hepatocytes. Finally, while an equimolar dose of the THRβ agonist Resmetirom reduced hepatic fat accumulation, it did not exert any antitumorigenic effect. The use of this novel thyromimetic represents a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of NAFLD-associated hepatocarcinogenesis.",2023,01,Frontiers in oncology,Andrea Caddeo; Marina Serra; Francesca Sedda; Andrea Bacci; Clementina Manera; Simona Rapposelli; Amedeo Columbano; Andrea Perra; Marta Anna Kowalik,1402,True,2023-01-01

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), a more advanced stage, carries a high risk of progression to liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, liver failure, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Until recently, lifestyle intervention remained the mainstay of MASH management, with no pharmacological treatments specifically approved. However, advances in understanding its pathophysiological mechanisms have fueled numerous clinical trials, culminating in the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of resmetirom as the first treatment for MASH in 2024. Additionally, many investigational drugs are nearing FDA approval or progressing through late-stage clinical trials.

Alpha-to-beta cell communication is not merely modulatory but a decisive mechanism sustaining islet function under metabolic stress. Alpha cell distribution, structural specializations at the alpha-beta interface, and adaptations in signaling pathways collectively shape glycemic set points and beta cell resilience.

Resmetirom, a liver-targeting agonist of the thyroid hormone receptor (THR), has recently been licenced by the FDA. We assess the effectiveness and safety of resmetirom in patients with NASH. PubMed, SCOPUS and Cochrane Central were searched till March 2024 to find potential articles. Outcomes assessed included MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF), Fat Reduction, and NASH Resolution Without Fibrosis, changes in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and triglyceride (TG) levels, along with diarrhoea, nausea, urinary tract infection (UTI), and headache. Subgroup analysis was performed between outcomes before and after 6 months. Outcomes were analyzed with a random-effects model and results presented as mean difference (MD) for continuous outcomes and odds ratios (OR) for safety analysis, along with their 95% confidence intervals.

41095961,The Timeline of the Association Between Diabetes and Cardiovascular Diseases: A Narrative Review.,"Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are two strongly associated conditions that mutually influence each other. This review aims to follow the historical timeline of their association by highlighting the changing paradigm in CV risk management and treatment strategies in type 2 diabetes (T2D). While the discovery of insulin was a breakthrough in reducing life-threatening complications like diabetic ketoacidosis, patients with diabetes still faced a poor prognosis in terms of macrovascular outcomes, especially CVDs. Initial efforts in improving outcomes by tightly controlling glycemia proved insufficient, highlighting the complex relationship between the two diseases. After decades of focusing solely on glucose-lowering strategies, rosiglitazone, a promising new drug was developed, ultimately raising the flag about the potential higher risk of CV complications like myocardial infarction associated with its use. This turning point shifted the focus towards CV safety of novel glucose-lowering drugs, mandating for the development of cardiovascular outcome trials. Several drug classes, like sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), exceeded expectations by not only providing safety but also benefits in patients with T2D and CVDs and becoming the new standard of care in T2D management. The historical evidence linking T2D and CVDs has shaped regulatory requirements for cardiovascular outcome trials, guideline recommendations, and current therapeutic strategies. These insights highlight the importance of early interventions and a multidisciplinary approach to optimize patient outcomes.",2025,Sep,Journal of clinical medicine,Silvia Ana Luca; Raluca Malina Bungau; Sandra Lazar; Andreea Herascu; Laura Gaita; Vlad-Florian Avram; Bogdan Timar,1681,True,2025-09-01

This 52-week prospective, observational study aimed to identify predictors of weight reduction (≥5% from baseline) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) undergoing GLP-1RA therapy (semaglutide or dulaglutide, including oral formulations). A total of 194 adults with T2D initiating GLP-1RA therapy were evaluated at baseline, and after 6, and 12 months of therapy. To identify predictors of weight loss, variables differing between Responders (weight loss ≥5% than baseline) and Non-Responders were evaluated by ROC analysis and tested in univariate and multivariate logistic regression models adjusted for age, gender, GLP-1RA type and dosage. At 6 and 12 months, 58% and 49% of patients, respectively, achieved the primary outcome. Responders at 12 months exhibited elevated BMI, waist circumference, hepatic steatosis indices, fat mass, and insulin levels at baseline, along with reduced muscle-to-fat and muscle-to-visceral adipose tissue ratios. Moreover, female gender, younger age, shorter disease duration, and non-use of metformin prior to enrollment were significantly associated with response. Notably, early response at 6 months strongly predicted 12-month success. Our results highlight a valuable interplay between body composition, liver involvement, and the incretin response, also suggesting a maximal synergistic effect between metformin and GLP-1RAs when treatments are initiated concurrently rather than sequentially.

41048045,ETV1 is a key regulator of enteroendocrine PYY production.,"Background The intestine constitutes the largest endocrine organ and is a rich source of hormones that regulate metabolism. Enteroendocrine cells (EECs) can be subtyped based on their secretion of specific hormones with L-cells being characterised by expression of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and peptide YY (PYY). Collectively, these hormones play important roles in appetite regulation, however, it is not known, how they are regulated transcriptionally. The ETS Variant Transcription Factor 1 (ETV1) is expressed by L-cells, but its function remains unknown. Methods We examined Etv1 expression in single-cell-RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) datasets from the mouse small intestine and from organoid cultures. To assess the functional role of ETV1 in EECs, ETV1 loss-of-function and overexpression experiments were performed in murine small intestinal organoids. Gene expression was subsequently assessed with qPCR and scRNA-seq. Results We confirmed that Etv1 is enriched in the L-cell lineage both in vivo and in organoid cultures. Furthermore, we find that mutations of ETV1 in organoids led to a decrease in Pyy expression levels with no effect on Gcg levels or on overall cell composition and organoid morphology. Moreover, overexpression of ETV1 led to a modest but specific increase in Pyy levels. Conclusions We identify ETV1 as a regulator of Pyy expression illustrating for the first time how specific hormone levels in the L-cell lineage are transcriptionally regulated.",2025,Oct,Disease models & mechanisms,Astrid M Baattrup; Marianne Terndrup Pedersen; Stine L Hansen; Martti Maimets; Fiona Gribble; Frank Reimann; Kim B Jensen,1484,True,2025-10-01

These include kidney diseases, cardiovascular diseases, stroke, and hypertension. The objective of the present research was to investigate the relationship of CMI with the risk of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) in a sample of the Iranian population. This cross-sectional study included 3,120 participants from the second phase of the Amol cohort study. Ultrasound scanning was utilized to diagnose the NAFLD. The hepatic steatosis index (HSI), fatty liver index (FLI), and CMI values were calculated using standard equations. Multivariate and univariate logistic regression models were employed to investigate the relationship between CMI and NAFLD, FLI, and HSI. In the adjusted model, we found that the likelihood of NAFLD increased in the second and last tertiles of CMI compared to the first tertile (T). For NAFLD the odds ratio (OR) were 1.883 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.487-3.653) in T The current study showed a significant association between CMI and NAFLD, as measured by ultrasound, FLI, and HSI.

A multicenter, retrospective cohort study. Twelve adult ICUs across Queensland, including tertiary referral and regional centers, from January 1, 2015, to December 31, 2021. Adults (≥18 years) with ACHD. No interventions. ACHD cases were stratified by lesion complexity and admission type (medical vs surgical). Outcomes included ICU and hospital length of stay and 30-day and 1-year mortality. Of 89,184 ICU admissions, 1,870 (2.1%) involved ACHD. The most common diagnoses were valvular (57.9%) and septal (31.0%) malformations. Lesion complexity was classified as simple (1,543/1,870; 82.5%), moderate (220/1,870; 11.8%), and complex (60/1,870; 3.2%). Medical patients (253/1,870; 13.5%) had greater illness severity, more frequent use of renal replacement therapy and ECMO, and longer ICU (3 [2-6] v 2 [2-6] days; p < 0.001) and hospital length of stay: 18 [10-33] v 8 [6-13] days; p < 0.001) when compared to surgical patients. Mortality was significantly higher in medical admissions (30 day: 34/253: 13.4%; 1 year: 50/253: 19.8%) than in surgical (30 day: 20/1,617: 1.2%; 1 year: 42/1617: 2.6%; p < 0.001). One-year mortality was also higher in patients with complex lesions (11/60; 18.3%) versus simple (67/1,543; 4.3%). ACHD patients are an uncommon but important ICU population.

Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are widely used for glycemic control and weight management, with emerging evidence suggesting potential anti-inflammatory effects. To examine the association between GLP-1RA use and systemic inflammation, measured by high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis using National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2010 data. Survey-weighted linear regression models were used to assess the relationship between GLP-1 use and log-transformed CRP, adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic, and clinical factors. GLP-1 users had significantly higher CRP levels in unadjusted models (β=1.081, p<0.01). However, after adjusting for age, gender, race/ethnicity, income, body mass index (BMI), diabetes, glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and smoking, the association was no longer statistically significant (β=0.323, p=0.38). Clinical factors accounted for most of the variance. In this cross-sectional, population-based analysis, GLP-1RA use was not independently associated with lower systemic inflammation after accounting for demographic and clinical confounders. The higher hs-CRP observed among GLP-1 users in unadjusted models is most consistent with confounding by indication and greater cardiometabolic disease burden among treated individuals rather than a direct pro-inflammatory effect of the medications. Longitudinal studies with larger contemporary samples (including newer GLP-1 agents) and repeated inflammatory measures are needed to clarify whether GLP-1 therapies exert direct anti-inflammatory effects beyond their metabolic benefits.",2025,Aug,Cureus,Sharokeen Youkhana; Seun S Odusanmi; Bruno K Ihuchukwu; Mathew Ezekiel; Edidiong Enyeneokpon; Christina Cumaaran; Emmanuel O Akpamgbo; Okelue E Okobi,1867,True,2025-08-01

Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MASLD), affecting 38% of adults worldwide, represents a multisystem disorder with substantial morbidity and mortality. This first European prospective cohort study systematically examines the association between MASLD and incident gout risk. Utilizing UK Biobank data (n = 402,083 after exclusions), we conducted a prospective cohort analysis excluding participants with baseline gout, arthritis, hepatitis B/C, alcohol-related liver disease, or events within the initial 2-year follow-up. Cox proportional hazards models evaluated MASLD-gout associations, with Kaplan-Meier curves illustrating cumulative incidence. MASLD patients exhibited a 71% elevated gout risk versus non-MASLD counterparts (HR = 1.71, 95% CI 1.59-1.83, P < 0.0001). Subgroup analyses revealed consistent associations across demographics, with attenuated risk in older adults (≥ 65 years: HR = 1.55 vs. < 65 years: HR = 1.86). Paradoxically, individuals without diabetes, hypertension, or central obesity demonstrated a higher gout risk than those with these comorbidities. MASLD patients showed significantly greater cumulative gout incidence over time (P < 0.001).

Forty-two male Wistar rats (6 weeks old) were divided into 7 groups (n = 6 per group): 1- Control (CON), 2- Dexamethasone (DEX), 3- DEX + moderate-intensity training (DEX-MIT), 4- DEX + high intensity training (DEX-HIT), 5- DEX + silymarin (DEX-S), 6- DEX + moderate intensity training + silymarin (DEX-MIT-S), 7- DEX-high intensity training + silymarin (DEX-HIT-S). NAFLD was induced by subcutaneous administration of dexamethasone for 7 days. Exercise groups underwent 8 weeks of treadmill running (5 sessions/week) at matched distances for MIT and HIT protocols. Silymarin was administered via oral gavage at a dose of 300 mg/kg body weight/day. Gene expression levels of mTORC1, AMPKα2, Bcl-2, Parkin, and LC3 were measured using real-time PCR. Protein levels of PINK1, Beclin-1, and P62 were assessed by western blotting. Moderate and high intensity training significantly reduced Bcl-2 and LC3 gene expression and increased P62 protein levels compared to the DEX group (P < 0.05). Silymarin supplementation significantly decreased expression of Parkin, Bcl-2, LC3, and PINK1 compared to the DEX (P < 0.05).

Using paired single-nucleus RNA-seq and ATAC-seq on caudate samples from 143 human postmortem brains, including 74 with AUD, we identified 17 distinct cell types. A significant portion of the alcohol-related differences in gene expression were accompanied by a corresponding difference in chromatin accessibility within the gene. We observed transcriptional differences in medium spiny neurons that impact RNA metabolism and immune response pathways. A small cluster of D1/D2 hybrid neurons showed AUD-induced differences distinct from the D1 and D2 types, suggesting a unique role in AUD. Those with AUD had a higher proportion of microglia in an inflammatory state; astrocytes entered a reactive state partially regulated by JUND. Oligodendrocyte dysregulation was driven in part by OLIG2 activity and increased TGF-β1 signaling from microglia and astrocytes. We also observed increased microglia-astrocyte communication via the IL-1β pathway. These findings provide valuable insights into the genetic and cellular mechanisms in the caudate related to AUD.

41103708,Longitudinal assessment of liver stiffness and risk factors for advanced fibrosis in adolescents with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: a retrospective observational study.,"The global incidence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in adolescents is steadily increasing. This research aims to characterize adolescents diagnosed with MASLD clinically and evaluate their long-term outcomes in community and tertiary medical centers located in Shanghai. Furthermore, the investigation assesses the diagnostic efficacy of vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) among adolescents with MASLD. We retrospectively analyzed data from adolescent patients (10-18 years) diagnosed with MASLD referred to Shanghai hospitals during the period 2019-2023. Diagnostic criteria included sustained alanine transaminase elevations exceeding twice the upper normal threshold or radiological confirmation of hepatic steatosis, following exclusion of alternative etiologies. VCTE-derived liver stiffness measurements (LSMs) were classified as normal (≤7.0 kPa, F0-F1), significant fibrosis (7.1-9.0 kPa, F2), and advanced fibrosis (≥9.1 kPa, F3-F4), to distinguish fibrosis severity. A total of 140 adolescents were enrolled (67.9% male), with an average age of 13.8 years. Dyslipidemia was common (48.6%;  There is a rapid increase in adolescent MASLD incidence in Shanghai. According to LSM assessments, adolescents diagnosed with MASLD may have heightened risks of advanced hepatic fibrosis as they approach late adolescence.",2025,01,Frontiers in medicine,Wenshu Cao; Congcong Feng; Jizhong Ye; Jianfeng Zhou; Lin Wang; Yanling Lian,1375,True,2025-01-01
41123287,Metabolic Health Phenotypes Among Middle- to Older-Aged Adults Living With and Without Obesity: Relationships With Hepatic Health Indicators.,"The recent reclassification of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease reflects the central role of metabolic dysfunction in its pathogenesis. Obesity underlies metabolic perturbations; however, liver health risks are not exclusive to individuals with a higher BMI and some individuals with obesity have favorable metabolic health (MH). Thus far, there has been limited examination of liver health indicators among metabolically healthy and unhealthy phenotypes, which is the aim of this study. A cross-sectional sample of 2040 middle- to older-aged adults were classified as metabolically healthy obese (MHO), metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO), metabolically healthy nonobese (MHNO), and metabolically unhealthy nonobese (MUNO), according to three MH definitions (MeigsA, MeigsB, and Wildman). Liver biomarkers alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) were measured, and the fatty liver index (FLI) was calculated. Crude and adjusted logistic regression models examined associations between liver function indicators and MH phenotypes. In fully adjusted models, higher FLI scores were consistently associated with lower likelihood of MHO and MHNO (odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals for MHO: 0.947 (0.934, 0.961) [MeigsA], 0.952 (0.938, 0.966) [MeigsB] and 0.945 (0.931, 0.959) [Wildman] and for MHNO: 0.957 (0.950, 0.964) [MeigsA], 0.950 (0.942, 0.958) [MeigsB] and 0.961 (0.955, 0.968) [Wildman] (all p < 0.001)). Higher ALT and GGT concentrations were inversely associated with MHO, and AST additionally with MHNO, in all models across the three definitions. Liver function indicators are linked with MH status in middle- to older-aged adults.",2025,Oct,Hepatology research : the official journal of the Japan Society of Hepatology,Grainne Dolan; Seán R Millar; Ivan J Perry; Catherine M Phillips,1799,True,2025-10-01
41100163,"The genetical evolution of social preferences: where the categorical imperatives of Hamilton, Kant and Nash meet.","This paper models the genetical evolution of individual behavioral rules that guide the choice of strategies in pairwise assortative interactions under incomplete information. Building on results at the crossroads of evolutionary theory and game theory, it is first shown that in an uninvadable population state of behavioral rule evolution, individuals are compelled to use strategies that are Nash equilibria of a lineage fitness game. Thus, choice behavior evolves to be representable as the maximization of a utility function, as if each individual holds a personal preference that orders both their own and their interaction partner's strategies. Second, the paper contrasts two representations of personal utility that are found to be uninvadable. The first is semi-Kantian in form. This preference averages a fitness self-interest with a relatedness weighted Kantian interest. The latter interest evaluates the consequence of own behavior for own fitness, assuming the interaction partner adopts the same behavior as self. The second preference is a personal inclusive fitness. This preference combines a self-regarding interest with a relatedness weighted other-regarding interest. Each such interest takes the form of an average effect, which evaluates the consequence of expressing own behavior, instead of average population behavior, on a statistical average fitness to self and the interaction partner.",2025,Oct,Journal of evolutionary biology,Laurent Lehmann,1416,True,2025-10-01

41138239,Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on gastrointestinal function and symptoms.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are approved for diabetes, obesity, and metabolic liver disease, but are also used off-label for other conditions. Adverse events associated with GLP-1RAs have become evident with their increased use. This review characterizes GLP-1 physiology and GLP-1RA effects on gastrointestinal (GI) function and symptoms. A comprehensive literature search was conducted accessing PubMed and EMBASE databases from July 1987 through August 2025. Effects of GLP-1RAs on parameters of dysfunctional GI transit and motility and symptoms potentially associated with these impairments are highlighted. The additional impact of GLP-1RA induced gastric food retention on the risk for pulmonary aspiration during anesthesia is a focus of concern. Extraintestinal complications including biliary tract disease and pancreatitis are discussed. Management of GLP-1RA adverse events is reviewed including adjustment of dosing protocols, dietary modifications, and pharmacotherapy to target GI symptoms, however these recommendations lack evidence-based support. New GLP-1RAs are in testing, many with action on other incretin pathways, but these may have adverse consequences similar to existing agents. Prospective investigations of multicenter databases are advocated to transform management approaches of these GLP-1RA induced GI functional consequences and adverse symptoms from empiric treatments to more evidence-based protocols.",2025,Oct,Expert review of gastroenterology & hepatology,Rosita D Frazier; William L Hasler,1464,True,2025-10-01
39589833,Efficacy and safety of resmetirom for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis: a GRADE assessed systematic review and meta-analysis.,"There are no Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved treatment options for nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) which is a prevailing disease that leads to fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Hence, this systematic review and meta-analysis aims to determine the efficacy and safety of resmetirom, the first FDA-approved drug, for the treatment of NASH. A Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation assessed systematic search of Cochrane Library , MEDLINE , Scopus , and Google Scholar database was conducted from inception till 31 March 2024. Meta-analyses were carried out in accordance with the PRISMA statement. Heterogeneity was determined to be significant if found above 50%. This meta-analysis encompasses three randomized clinical trials, including a total of 2231 patients. The findings show resmetirom's significant efficacy in several key outcomes, including improvement in fibrosis risk ratios, 1.67 [95% confidence intervals (CI), 1.26-2.20], reductions in liver fat content (95% CI, -39.58 to -23.5), and enhanced liver fibrosis score (95% CI, -0.37 to -0.13) along with improved levels of liver enzymes. Resmetirom was found to be associated with nausea and diarrhea. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the safety and efficacy of resmetirom which showed significant positive results in fibrosis improvement, liver fat content, lipid profiles, and liver enzymes in comparison to placebo. Moreover, moderate side effects, such as diarrhea and nausea, were seen in few patients indicating a satisfactory safety profile.",2025,Mar,European journal of gastroenterology & hepatology,Muhammad Talha; Mohammad Haris Ali; Zain Ali Nadeem; Umar Akram; Praveen Bharath Saravanan; Muhammad Hamza Awais Khalid,1606,True,2025-03-01
38714040,Intrahepatic hypothyroidism in MASLD: Role of liver-specific thyromimetics including resmetirom.,"Thyroid hormones are important regulators of hepatic lipid homeostasis and whole-body energy expenditure. Recent evidence suggests that euthyroid individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) develop intrahepatic hypothyroidism that promotes progression of MASH. A literature search was performed with Medline (PubMed), Scopus and Google Scholar electronic databases from inception till March 2024, using the following keywords: hypothyroidism and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease; MASLD and thyroid function; intrahepatic hypothyroidism; TRβ agonists; and resmetirom. Relevant studies were extracted that described pathogenesis of MASH in the context of thyroid functions. In euthyroid individuals with MASH, there is decreased conversion of prohormone thyroxine (T4) to bioactive tri-iodothyronine (T3) and increased conversion of T4 to inactive metabolite reverse T3 (rT3). Consequently, reduced levels of T3 results in impaired intrahepatic TRβ signaling, a state of intrahepatic hypothyroidism, which promotes progression of MASH. Hepatic TRβ activation leads to metabolically beneficial effects in the liver including mitochondrial fatty acid uptake and β-oxidation, mitochondrial biogenesis, increasing surface low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor density and lowering of circulatory LDL-cholesterol. In recent years, selective thyroid hormone mimetics that exhibit TRβ-selective binding and liver-selective uptake have been designed. Resmetirom, a liver-specific thyromimetic, improves intrahepatic TRβ signaling and in clinical trials significantly improved liver inflammation, fibrosis and lipid profile in patients with MASH. In euthyroid individuals with MASH, development of intrahepatic hypothyroidism results in further progression of the disease. In clinical trials, resmetirom treatment results in a significant improvement in steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis and is the first drug approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of noncirrhotic MASH with moderate to advanced fibrosis.",2024,May,Diabetes & metabolic syndrome,Mohammad Shafi Kuchay; Scott Isaacs; Anoop Misra,2061,True,2024-05-01

41156559,Visceral Obesity and Metabolic Dysfunction in IgA Nephropathy: Nutritional and Metabolic Perspectives on Disease Progression.,"IgA nephropathy (IgAN) is the most common primary glomerulonephritis in the world. In addition to genetic and immunological factors, visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome (MetS) are the main determinants of disease progression. This review aims to critically assess the role of visceral obesity and metabolic syndrome in driving the progression of IgA nephropathy (IgAN), with an emphasis on their underlying pathophysiological mechanisms and clinical implications. A systematic review was carried out in accordance with PRISMA guidelines. PubMed was searched (2015-2025) using terms related to IgA nephropathy, obesity, metabolic syndrome, and immunometabolic pathways. Only English-language observational and clinical studies in adults, excluding pediatric and animal studies, were included in the review. Additional sources were consulted to give context to the mechanistic aspects of obesity-related IgAN progression. Visceral obesity and MetS accelerate IgAN progression through endocrine, inflammatory, and immune pathways, including cytokines derived from visceral adipose tissue, adipokines, intestinal dysbiosis, and BAFF/APRIL-mediated immune activation. MetS patients had higher proteinuria, a faster decrease in eGFR, and a higher risk of end-stage renal failure (23/65 vs. 15/60 endpoints,  Obesity should be considered a chronic disease and a modifiable risk factor for IgAN. Nutrition-focused interventions targeting visceral obesity and metabolic dysfunction can slow the progression of the disease and should be included in renal guidelines. This review expands current knowledge by demonstrating that when sequential steps of IgAN pathophysiology are mapped with respect to endocrine and immunological effects of visceral adipose tissue, they converge on the same proinflammatory and immune pathways. This convergence suggests a bidirectional amplification loop in which obesity accelerates IgAN progression and increases the burden of complications.",2025,Oct,Nutrients,Agnieszka Skibicka; Sylwia Małgorzewicz,1971,True,2025-10-01

41011082,Impact of Incretin-Based Therapy on Skeletal Muscle Health.,"Skeletal muscle is the largest insulin-sensitive tissue in the human body, playing a crucial role in glucose homeostasis, body mobility and overall metabolic health. In obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D), skeletal muscle undergoes structural, functional, and metabolic alterations, including reduced muscle mass, impaired contractile function, increased myosteatosis, mitochondrial dysfunction, and chronic low-grade inflammation. Incretin-based therapies such as glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) or dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) RAs are highly effective treatments for T2D and obesity, producing substantial weight loss. While clinical trials suggest proportional loss of fat and lean mass when using incretin-based therapies, emerging preclinical and translational data indicate potential muscle-specific beneficial effects such as attenuation of atrophy, improved myogenesis, enhanced mitochondrial function and reduced myosteatosis. This review comprehensively summarizes the current preclinical and clinical evidence on the impact of incretin-based therapies on skeletal muscle mass, composition, metabolism, and performance, focusing on mechanistic insights from animal models and translational findings from human studies.",2025,Sep,"Medicina (Kaunas, Lithuania)",Andrijana Koceva; Andrej Janež; Mojca Jensterle,1282,True,2025-09-01
40149860,Linking Cardiovascular Disease and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD): The Role of Cardiometabolic Drugs in MASLD Treatment.,"The link between cardiovascular disease (CVD) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is well-established at both the epidemiological and pathophysiological levels. Among the common pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the development and progression of both diseases, oxidative stress and inflammation, insulin resistance, lipid metabolism deterioration, hepatokines, and gut dysbiosis along with genetic factors have been recognized to play a pivotal role. Pharmacologic interventions with drugs targeting common modifiable cardiometabolic risk factors, such as T2DM, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, are a reasonable strategy to prevent CVD development and progression of MASLD. Recently, a novel drug for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), resmetirom, has shown positive effects regarding CVD risk, opening new opportunities for the therapeutic approach of MASLD and CVD. This review provides current knowledge on the epidemiologic association of MASLD to CVD morbidity and mortality and enlightens the possible underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms linking MASLD with CVD. The role of cardiometabolic drugs such as anti-hypertensive drugs, hypolipidemic agents, glucose-lowering medications, acetylsalicylic acid, and the thyroid hormone receptor-beta agonist in the progression of MASLD is also discussed. Metformin failed to prove beneficial effects in MASLD progression. Studies on the administration of thiazolinediones in MASLD suggest effectiveness in improving steatosis, steatohepatitis, and fibrosis, while newer categories of glucose-lowering agents such as GLP-1Ra and SGLT-2i are currently being tested for their efficacy across the whole spectrum of MASLD. Statins alone or in combination with ezetimibe have yielded promising results. The conduction of long-duration, large, high-quality, randomized-controlled trials aiming to assess by biopsy the efficacy of cardiometabolic drugs to reverse MASLD progression is of great importance.",2025,Feb,Biomolecules,Marios Zisis; Maria Eleni Chondrogianni; Theodoros Androutsakos; Ilias Rantos; Evangelos Oikonomou; Antonios Chatzigeorgiou; Eva Kassi,2011,True,2025-02-01
40222485,Global Consensus Recommendations for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease and Steatohepatitis.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and steatohepatitis (MASH) are associated with adverse clinical outcomes, impaired health-related quality of life, and significant economic burden. The growing burden of MASLD and MASH has led to the publication of a large number of MASLD/MASH guidelines by national and international societies. However, important differences among the recommendations have created confusion, contributing to a low implementation rate and suboptimal management of MASLD and MASH. Creating a consensus recommendation has become more important since the approval of a selective agonist of thyroid hormone β receptor (resmetirom) for MASH treatment in the United States. We built a consensus among the most recently published recommendations for MASLD/MASH. A comprehensive search for MASLD and MASH guidelines, guidance documents, or similar publications from January 2018 to January 2025 using PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and society websites was conducted. Each selected document was assessed across 8 specific domains with 145 variables. Variables with <50% concordance were used for the Delphi statement development. A supermajority threshold of 67% was set for statement acceptance. There were 61 documents published from 2018 through January 2025. Four rounds of Delphi were conducted: 46 statements were generated for Round 1, 32 statements for Round 2, 16 statements for Round 3, and 8 statements for Round 4, whereby 100% of statements achieved a greater than 90% agreement. All final consensus recommendations were summarized in tables and algorithms. Our study provides an extensive set of recommendations generated based on a comprehensive review of the most recent MASLD/MASH guidelines and a consensus-building process.",2025,Oct,Gastroenterology,Zobair M Younossi; Shira Zelber-Sagi; Jeffrey V Lazarus; Vincent Wai-Sun Wong; Yusuf Yilmaz; Ajay Duseja; Yuichiro Eguchi; Laurent Castera; Mário Guimarães Pessoa; Claudia Pinto Oliveira; Mohamed El-Kassas; Emmanuel Tsochatzis; Jian-Gao Fan; C Wendy Spearman; Frank Tacke; Marlen Ivon Castellanos Fernandez; Naim Alkhouri; Jörn M Schattenberg; Manuel Romero-Gómez; Mazen Noureddin; Alina M Allen; Janus P Ong; Stuart K Roberts; Jay H Shubrook; Patrizia Burra; Rohit Kohli; Achim Kautz; Adriaan G Holleboom; Brian Lam; Scott Isaacs; Paula Macedo; Amalia Gastaldelli; Linda Henry; Dana Ivancovsky-Wajcman; Fatema Nader; Leyla de Avila; Jillian K Price; Henry E Mark; Marcela Villota-Rivas; Aurora Barberá; Markos Kalligeros; Lynn H Gerber; Saleh A Alqahtani,1785,True,2025-10-01
41145379,Digital engagement enhances dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist and GLP-1 receptor agonist efficacy: A retrospective cohort analysis of a digital weight loss service on outcomes and safety.,"We evaluated the weight loss efficacy and safety of a national digital weight loss service (DWLS) and explored associations between digital engagement and outcomes in adults prescribed dual GIP/GLP-1RA and GLP-1RA. We conducted a retrospective longitudinal cohort analysis of adults prescribed dual GIP/GLP-1RA and GLP-1RA between August 2024 and July 2025 within the Voy DWLS in the United Kingdom (UK). Digitally engaged patients met all three criteria: (i) ≥1 coaching session; (ii) weekly weight logging (≥4/month); and (iii) ≥1 additional in-app interaction.

41098241,Non-invasive tests for MetALD and alcohol-related liver disease.,"Metabolic- and alcohol-related liver disease (MetALD) and alcohol-related liver disease (ALD) are major drivers of the global burden of cirrhosis. While metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects nearly one-third of the global population, ALD and MetALD, though far less common, account for a disproportionately high rate of liver-related complications and deaths. Despite this, research and clinical focus on ALD and MetALD remain limited. A critical barrier is the late stage at which these conditions are typically diagnosed, often after the onset of decompensation. In this review, we explore the potential of non-invasive tests (NITs) to change the diagnostic landscape of ALD and MetALD. NITs offer a practical and scalable means to detect liver disease at earlier, compensated stages, before symptoms emerge, thereby opening a window for timely intervention. Beyond diagnosis, these tools also serve important roles in risk assessment, disease monitoring, and evaluating treatment response. As interest in therapeutic developments for ALD and MetALD grows, NITs are expected to become central to trial design, helping to identify suitable participants, assess ongoing alcohol use, and monitor efficacy without reliance on invasive biopsies. We also discuss broader strategies necessary to support early detection, including policy changes, stigma reduction, and improved access to care. Finally, we consider emerging biomarkers and their promise in advancing precision medicine approaches tailored to this high-risk patient population.",2025,Nov,JHEP reports : innovation in hepatology,Stine Johansen; Maja Thiele; Aleksander Krag,1573,True,2025-11-01
40136677,Pathogenic Mechanisms of Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD)-Associated Hepatocellular Carcinoma.,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the sixth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide. The etiology of HCC has now dramatically changed from viral hepatitis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). The main pathogenesis of MASLD-related HCC is the hepatic lipid accumulation of hepatocytes, which causes chronic inflammation and the subsequent progression of hepatic fibrosis. Chronic hepatic inflammation generates oxidative stress and DNA damage in hepatocytes, which contribute to genomic instability, resulting in the development of HCC. Several metabolic and molecular pathways are also linked to chronic inflammation and HCC in MASLD. In particular, the MAPK and PI3K-Akt-mTOR pathways are upregulated in MASLD, promoting the survival and proliferation of HCC cells. In addition, MASLD has been reported to enhance the development of HCC in patients with chronic viral hepatitis infection. Although there is no approved medication for MASLD besides resmetirom in the USA, there are some preventive strategies for the onset and progression of HCC. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitor, a class of medications, has been reported to exert anti-tumor effects on HCC by regulating metabolic reprogramming. Moreover, CD34-positive cell transplantation improves hepatic fibrosis by promoting intrahepatic angiogenesis and supplying various growth factors. Furthermore, exercise improves MASLD through an increase in energy consumption as well as changes in chemokines and myokines. In this review, we summarize the recent progress made in the pathogenic mechanisms of MASLD-associated HCC. Furthermore, we introduced new therapeutic strategies for preventing the development of HCC based on the pathogenesis of MASLD.",2025,Mar,Cells,Toru Nakamura; Atsutaka Masuda; Dan Nakano; Keisuke Amano; Tomoya Sano; Masahito Nakano; Takumi Kawaguchi,1789,True,2025-03-01
41163813,Semaglutide Exacerbates Stunting in Growth-Impaired Juvenile Male Mice via Reduced Energy Metabolism.,"Animals rely on linear growth to attain their full adult size. The regulators of this multifactorial process, including environmental and endocrine cues, are still incompletely understood. Notably, GLP-1, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) has emerged as a potential player in this process. Here, we employ semaglutide, a pharmaceutical GLP-1R agonist as a tool to mechanistically dissect the interplay between GLP-1 receptor activation, energy metabolism, and linear growth during the juvenile period, independent of its clinical applications. Using a juvenile mouse model, we show that chronic semaglutide treatment lowers blood glucose without affecting food intake or weight gain in juveniles with a normal growth pattern. However, in growth-stunted juveniles, semaglutide treatment exacerbates linear growth impairment through at least 2 concomitant mechanisms: a moderate reduction in food intake, and a decreased catabolic activity incompatible with tissue growth. These data suggest a complex interplay between GLP-1 signaling, energy metabolism, and growth during juvenile development. Overall, these findings highlight the value of semaglutide as a mechanistic tool for understanding how GLP-1 receptor activation modulates growth and metabolism in juveniles, emphasizing the importance of developmental context for interpreting its effects.",2025,Nov,Journal of the Endocrine Society,Amélie Joly; Lucas Rebiffé; Yves Dusabyinema; Julien Dellinger; Estelle Caillon; Karine Gauthier; François Leulier; Filipe De Vadder,1349,True,2025-11-01
41133065,Comparative Effectiveness of Lifestyle Versus Pharmacologic Therapy in Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD): A 12-Month Multicenter Observational Study.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing global health concern linked to metabolic syndrome (MetS) and insulin resistance.  The objective of the study is to compare the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions versus pharmacological therapy in the management of NAFLD across multiple healthcare centers using a real-world observational cohort design.  This multicentric observational cohort study was conducted from January 2023 to December 2024 at the Lady Reading Hospital (LRH), Peshawar, and Hayatabad Medical Complex (HMC), Peshawar. The 12-month follow-up was completed by 367 (90.84%) of the 404 patients who were recruited. Participants were split into two groups: one for pharmaceutical treatment (n = 179) and another for lifestyle intervention (n = 188). At baseline and after a year, clinical, biochemical, and radiological data were evaluated. Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) version 26 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, US) was used for data analysis. The lifestyle group showed significantly greater reductions in weight (-4.52 ± 2.10 kg vs. -1.65 ± 1.44 kg; p < 0.001), body mass index (BMI) (-1.43 ± 0.65 vs. -0.52 ± 0.48 kg/m²; p < 0.001), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (-18.77 ± 10.84 vs. -15.23 ± 9.45 U/L; p = 0.004), and FibroScan (transient elastography) scores (-1.98 ± 0.84 vs. -1.47 ± 0.78 kPa; p < 0.001) compared to the pharmacological group. ALT reduction > 30% was observed in 112 (59.57%) lifestyle patients versus 89 (49.72%) pharmacological patients (p = 0.048), and BMI reduction ≥ 5% in 106 (56.38%) vs. 41 (22.91%), respectively (p < 0.001).  Lifestyle intervention is more effective than pharmacological therapy in improving metabolic and liver-related outcomes in NAFLD patients.",2025,Sep,Cureus,Zubair Ahmad; Muhammad Hamza Ghufran; Suleman Khan; Zeeshan Muzaffar; Qazi Muhammad Safwan; Muhammad Nouman Shuja; Hamza Usman; Usman Khan; Saeed Ullah; Syed Ali Abdullah Jan; Naqeeb Ullah,1743,True,2025-09-01
41122157,Role of essential oils in preventing hepatotoxicity: A comprehensive review.,"Hepatotoxicity represents one of the significant and challenging health concerns at the worldwide level. To overcome this condition, essential oil can act as a natural therapeutic in alleviating hepatic disorders caused by toxins, drugs, alcohol, or infections. Various aromatic plants such as Citrus species, Allium species, spices, and rosemary species contain bioactive compounds-mainly terpenes, phenolics, flavonoids, and sulfur-containing compounds. These bioactive compounds possess excellent antioxidant potential to neutralize free radicals and promote the endogenous antioxidant defense system, such as SOD, catalase, Gpx, and others as well. In addition to this, they exhibit anti-inflammatory potential to regulate inflammatory cascades and cytokine levels, while their detoxification mechanism stimulates the liver's capacity to eradicate harmful substances. Although previous research has documented that essential oil exhibits the ability to protect the liver from chronic diseases-mainly fibrosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), and drug-induced hepatotoxicity-by modulating lipid metabolism, hepatocyte integrity, the antioxidant defense system, and pathological factors, future research is still required to evaluate its efficacy, bioavailability, safe doses, and explore synergistic formulations. Keeping these perspectives in mind, the current review is planned to highlight the hepatoprotective properties of essential oils, their underlying mechanisms, and their prospective contribution to the development of natural therapeutics for liver health.",2025,01,Hepatology forum,Kusum Sharma; Komal Sharma; Veena Sharma; Nikita Paliya; Vikas Malik,1583,True,2025-01-01
39047721,Effect of Dual Glucagon-Like Peptide 1/Glucose-Dependent Insulinotropic Polypeptide Receptor Agonist (Tirzepatide) versus Bariatric Surgery on Weight Loss and Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease.,"Bariatric surgery is a well-established treatment for obesity and type 2 diabetes. Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist, has emerged as a promising therapy for type 2 diabetes. This study aimed to compare the effects of bariatric surgery, semaglutide (a GLP-1 receptor agonist), and tirzepatide in Sprague-Dawley rats fed a high-fat diet. Rats were divided into surgery, semaglutide, and tirzepatide treatment groups, along with a control group (sham). Weight, oral glucose tolerance, and levels of metabolic markers were assessed, along with adipose and liver tissue analysis. Surgery led to a 15.5% weight reduction, while rats treated with semaglutide exhibited a 10.7% reduction. Tirzepatide treatment at various concentrations (10, 50, and 100 nmol/kg) resulted in weight reductions of 5.0%, 14.9%, and 17.7%, respectively, compared to the sham group. Metabolic analyte levels decreased in intervention groups compared to the sham group, indicating improved metabolic health and glucose tolerance. Adipose tissue weight and hepatic liver fat droplets decreased in the intervention groups. Bariatric surgery and tirzepatide treatment significantly improved metabolic parameters in obese rats. Tirzepatide, particularly at higher concentrations, showed pronounced improvements compared to surgery and semaglutide. These findings suggest that high doses of tirzepatide could be explored as an alternative to bariatric surgery for the treatment of obesity.",2024,01,"Medical principles and practice : international journal of the Kuwait University, Health Science Centre",Salman Al-Sabah; Irina Al-Khairi; Mohammad Jamal; Mohammad Qaddoumi; Fahad Alajmi; Jijin Kumar; Nermeen Abukhalaf; Preethi Cherian; Dhanya Madhu; Hossein Arefanian; Carol Dsouza; Nada Alam-Eldin; Abdullah AlSabagh; Ashraf Al Madhoun; Suleiman Al-Sabah; Fahd Al-Mulla; Mohamed Abu-Farha; Jehad Abubaker,1468,True,2024-01-01
41085201,"White matter microstructure is differentially impacted by cerebral amyloid angiopathy, neurofibrillary tangles, and neuritic plaque co-pathology.","White matter (WM) is affected by and serves as a pathway to neurofibrillary tangle (NFT) propagation in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) associates with neuritic plaques (NPs) to exacerbate NFT accumulation. We aim to study how these co-pathologies affect WM integrity. We performed a cross-sectional study of ante mortem diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) data according to participants' post mortem NFT, NP, and CAA neuropathology, from the National Alzheimer's Coordinating Center dataset. We found asymmetric DTI changes in several WM regions between Braak NFT stages II and IV and V/VI, and across CAA pathological burden, with increased mean, radial, and axial diffusivities. CAA-NFT co-pathology effects were observed mainly in the splenium of the corpus callosum. DTI metrics were associated with cognitive function and hippocampal volumes. Our results suggest that WM integrity is differentially impacted by AD neuropathology, with CAA and NFTs influencing each other's effects on WM microstructure. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) changes were observed in several white matter (WM) regions between advanced Braak stages and across cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA). CAA demonstrated a greater WM impact on the right hemisphere, while neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) had greater impact on the left.

40970009,Translating Trial to Treatment: A Scoping Review of Resmetirom First Year in Real-World Use for Moderate to Advanced Fibrosis in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formally known as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), a progressive subtype of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), remains a major global contributor to liver-related morbidity and mortality. In early 2024, a new therapeutic option, Resmetirom, a liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR-β) agonist, became available in the United States for individuals with MASH having moderate to advanced liver fibrosis (F2-F3), offering a targeted approach to treatment. This review aims to explore and consolidate real-world experience, clinical insights, regulatory developments, and implementation practices related to the use of Resmetirom within its first year of availability. This scoping review was conducted using a structured methodology aligned with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for scoping reviews (PRISMA-ScR) guidelines. Relevant literature was identified through systematic searches in PubMed, Google Scholar, and clinical trial registries, using Boolean operators (AND). Search specificity was tested during strategy development, and studies published between April 2024 and May 2025 were included based on PICOS (Population, Intervention, Comparison, Outcomes, and Study Designs) criteria, focusing on adults with noncirrhotic MASH and F2-F3 fibrosis treated with Resmetirom. Study designs included clinical trials, observational studies, post-market reports, and real-world evidence. Supplementary data were extracted from Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA) announcements and proceedings from major liver congresses - American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD) and European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL). The findings from the 20 studies included in this review were described using a narrative approach and grouped according to key themes. Key clinical trials and real-world data from the United States show that Resmetirom is effective in treating MASH, lowering liver fat and improving liver scarring in patients with moderate to advanced fibrosis (F2-F3). It also appears to be safe and well-tolerated, with good early adherence. Noninvasive tests to diagnose and monitor the disease are being used more often, but relying mainly on FIB-4 might miss some advanced cases. However, access to Resmetirom remains a challenge due to its high cost, insurance barriers, and limited evidence from global or high-risk populations. These issues highlight the need for fairer access and more post-approval studies to ensure broader use and understanding of the drug. In its first year of post-approval use, Resmetirom has shown consistent efficacy, safety, and quality-of-life benefits for patients with MASH and fibrosis. However, real-world adoption remains limited by high costs, complex access pathways, underrepresentation of high-risk populations, and a lack of global data. This review highlights existing evidence gaps and stresses the importance of global validation, improved diagnostic tools, and fair access to ensure Resmetirom can achieve its full clinical potential.",2025,Aug,Cureus,Kanika Vats; Mohammad Mazhar Alam,3176,True,2025-08-01
41060939,Effects of a polypill on circulating levels of resistin and visfatin in men with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease: A five-year clinical trial.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most prevalent liver disease globally, characterized by insulin resistance, hypertension, and obesity. Adipokines such as resistin and visfatin play significant roles in glucose homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Polypills are utilized to improve cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. The present observational study was nested within the PolyIran-Liver randomized controlled trial, which primarily assessed clinical outcomes in NAFLD patients. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of prolonged polypill consumption (five years) on circulating levels of resistin and visfatin as secondary outcomes in men with NAFLD. Participants from the PolyIran-Liver trial were included, comprising 41 patients in the control group and 40 patients in the polypill group, all of whom were men. The polypill regimen included aspirin, hydrochlorothiazide, atorvastatin, and valsartan. Treatment with the polypill resulted in a significant reduction in visfatin levels (2.27 ± 0.83 ng/ml vs. 2.10 ± 0.71 ng/ml, AdjP = 0.041), but no significant changes in resistin levels were observed within the polypill group (19.54 ± 4.11 ng/ml vs. 19.11 ± 3.08 ng/ml, AdjP = 0.396). The reduction in visfatin levels from baseline was significantly associated with changes in resistin levels and fasting blood glucose (FBG) (P < 0.05). Additionally, polypill intervention improved alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, lipid profiles, and systolic blood pressure in patients with NAFLD (P < 0.05). Our findings suggest that daily intake of the polypill can lead to significant reductions in visfatin levels and improvements in metabolic parameters in men with NAFLD. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term implications of polypill consumption in managing NAFLD through targeting adipokines.",2025,01,PloS one,Mahdieh Nazari-Robati; Tania Dehesh; Beydolah Shahouzehi; Gholamreza Roshandel; Hossein Poustchi; Solaleh Emamgholipour,1833,True,2025-01-01
41133734,Persimmon carotenoid extract rich in β-cryptoxanthin improves glucose homeostasis and reduces liver damage in high-fat-diet-induced type 2 diabetic and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease mice.,"Persimmon (Diospyros kaki Thunb.) byproducts are a remarkable source of bioactive compounds, particularly carotenoids. Several studies suggest that carotenoids have beneficial effects in prevention of a large number of diseases. This study aims to highlight the effects of a persimmon carotenoid extract (PSCE) rich in β-cryptoxanthin (β-CRX, 51%) in ameliorating type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in male C57BL6J mice. Animals were fed with a low-fat diet (LFD, n = 10), a LFD plus PSCE (0.8 mg kg Changes in body weight, glucose homeostasis, serum lipid profile, pro-inflammatory cytokine levels, total liver lipid content and extracellular collagen accumulation were determined. PSCE supplementation reduced body weight in 40% (P < 0.05), improved insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis (P < 0.01) and serum lipid profile (P < 0.05), decreased plasma pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in 30% (P < 0.05) and reduced liver steatosis and fibrosis (P < 0.05). In vitro, PSCE also reduced oxidative stress and triglyceride accumulation in 40% and 20%, respectively, in 3T3-L1 adipocytes (P < 0.001), supporting its in vivo effects. PSCE ameliorated HFD-induced metabolic dysfunction, inflammation and liver injury, suggesting persimmon byproducts represent a promising source of bioactive compounds for managing T2DM and MASLD.

41083173,Simultaneous portosystemic shunt and proximal splenic artery embolization for patients with therapy-refractory hepatic encephalopathy at risk of portal hypertensive complications.,"Hepatic encephalopathy (HE) is a well-known complication of cirrhosis. When HE recurs despite optimal treatment or without a clear precipitant, a portosystemic shunt may be the culprit. We present a case of therapy-refractory HE caused by a spontaneous portosystemic shunt (SPSS). A 69-year-old male with MASLD-related cirrhosis, with a medical history of biliopancreatic diversion and variceal bleeding, presented with his fifth episode of HE despite maximal pharmacological treatment. Initial lab tests and infectious screen were negative. Abdominal CT scan showed a paraesophageal shunt, supplied by the coronary vein. To address HE, SPSS closure was planned. Since SPSS closure could aggravate PHT and subsequently increase paracentesis frequency or induce variceal bleeding, this was combined with a proximal splenic artery embolization (pSAE). pSAE after SPSS closure resulted in a reduction of hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) from 21mmHg to 15 mmHg. HE symptoms resolved, pharmacological treatment was stopped, and paracentesis became less frequent. Weeks later, the patient was readmitted with abdominal pain, and CT confirmed splenic infarction. Recurrent spontaneous bacterial peritonitis necessitated splenectomy, which was complicated by hemorrhage, septic shock, and death. This case highlights the potential of combining SPSS closure and pSAE, two procedures that have not been combined before to our knowledge, to effectively reduce HE and HVPG, enabling cessation of anti-encephalopathic therapy and lowering paracentesis frequency. However, altered vascular anatomy can lead to complications such as splenic infarction. Although splenic infarction occurred as a complication, we believe this novel combined procedure warrants further investigation.",2025,01,Acta gastro-enterologica Belgica,A Lemaitre; S Nullens; M Van Herck; T Jardinet,1774,True,2025-01-01

Despite multiple therapeutic approaches under investigation, no globally approved standard pharmacotherapy currently exists. This systematic review aims to inform and enhance critical care and hepatology practice by synthesizing the most recent evidence on the pathogenesis and treatment of MASH and associated fibrosis. The review was conducted in accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A comprehensive literature search was performed using both text words and controlled vocabulary, incorporating Boolean operators (""AND,"" ""OR"") across PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library. The inclusion criteria encompassed open-access, full-text English-language randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between 2014 and 2024. Study quality was assessed using the RoB 2.0 tool, and the strength of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework. Fourteen RCTs were included. Of these, two were rated as high risk of bias (RoB) and consequently downgraded to ""low-quality"" evidence. Two RCTs with low RoB were classified as ""high-quality"" evidence, while the remaining 10 trials had unclear RoB, leading to a ""moderate-quality"" rating due to imprecision. This review discusses clinical trials evaluating therapies such as GLP-1 receptor agonists, THR-β agonists, pan-PPAR agonists, FGF21 analogues, and bariatric surgery. GLP-1 agonists and resmetirom (a THR-β agonist) demonstrated substantial reductions in liver fat content, while lanifibranor (a pan-PPAR agonist) also significantly improved fibrosis. Bariatric surgery showed MASH resolution in 56-70% of cases, though challenges remain regarding incomplete fibrosis reversal and the lack of long-term outcome data.

41084252,Therapeutic Trends in Diabetes Management: A Review on Oral Hypoglycemic Agents (OHAs) Utilization in Tertiary Care.,"Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder marked by insulin resistance and impaired insulin secretion. Effective glycemic management is critical for preventing problems, which can be achieved through Oral Hypoglycemic Agents (OHAs). Metformin is the first-line drug due to its insulin-sensitizing effects, while other classes, such as sulfonylureas, meglitinides, DPP-4 inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors, thiazolidinediones, and α-glucosidase inhibitors, serve complementary roles. Evolving treatment strategies increasingly favour combination therapies to increase outcomes. The review involved an extensive search of scientific databases and relevant literature, including studies published to date in PubMed, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM), oral hypoglycaemic agents, pharmacoeconomics, insulin sensitivity, SGLT2 inhibitors, and Thiazolidinediones were among the search phrases used. The selected papers were carefully evaluated for methodological soundness and the significance of their results. There is an increased prescribing of fixed-dose combinations, such as metforminvildagliptin, which has led to better adherence and control. Regional differences in costs have an impact on the accessibility of drugs. SGLT2 and GLP-1 drugs provide cardiovascular and renal effects, whereas DPP-4 drugs produce limited results. The difference in pharmacokinetics and a certain decline of β-cells may require the prescription of an individualized treatment, combination therapy, or the introduction of insulin over time. The current inclination to fixed-dose combinations improves compliance and glycemic control. Regional inequity is affected by the differences in costs. Better results in the use of SGLT2 and GLP-1 drugs favor their application in vulnerable patients, whereas the DDP-4 blocking agent is more appropriate in milder patient populations. Individualized treatment programs are a necessity, even with impaired β-cell functioning, which necessitates intensification of the therapy or insulin. Optimizing T2DM management requires a personalized approach that integrates clinical efficacy, safety, and cost into account. Regular prescription audits and targeted pharmacoeconomic strategies are vital for equitable access and long-term disease control worldwide.",2025,Oct,Cardiovascular & hematological disorders drug targets,Moidul Islam Judder; Mohidul Islam; Harmanjot Kaur; Rakibur Rahman; Kamal Deka; Manas Jyoti Kapil; Bhaskar Jyoti Pathak; Tanmay Sarma; Md Moidul Islam,2326,True,2025-10-01
38868948,Dissecting Acute Drug-Induced Hepatotoxicity and Therapeutic Responses of Steatotic Liver Disease Using Primary Mouse Liver and Blood Cells in a Liver-On-A-Chip Model.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is hallmarked by hepatic steatosis, cell injury, inflammation, and fibrosis. This study elaborates on a multicellular biochip-based liver sinusoid model to mimic MASLD pathomechanisms and investigate the therapeutic effects of drug candidates lanifibranor and resmetirom. Mouse liver primary hepatocytes, hepatic stellate cells, Kupffer cells, and endothelial cells are seeded in a dual-chamber biocompatible liver-on-a-chip (LoC). The LoC is then perfused with circulating immune cells (CICs). Acetaminophen (APAP) and free fatty acids (FFAs) treatment recapitulate acute drug-induced liver injury and MASLD, respectively. As a benchmark for the LoC, multiplex immunofluorescence on livers from APAP-injected and dietary MASLD-induced mice reveals characteristic changes on parenchymal and immune cell populations. APAP exposure induces cell death in the LoC, and increased inflammatory cytokine levels in the circulating perfusate. Under FFA stimulation, lipid accumulation, cellular damage, inflammatory secretome, and fibrogenesis are increased in the LoC, reflecting MASLD. Both injury conditions potentiate CIC migration from the perfusate to the LoC cellular layers. Lanifibranor prevents the onset of inflammation, while resmetirom decreases lipid accumulation in hepatocytes and increases the generation of FFA metabolites in the LoC.

Utilizing GBD 2021 data, we assessed NAFLD incidence, prevalence, mortality, disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), and estimated annual percentage changes (EAPCs) globally, regionally, nationally, and by sex, incorporating sociodemographic index (SDI) stratification; frontier analysis and health inequality assessments were also conducted. Findings reveal a substantial increase in global NAFLD burden: incidence rose 24.2% to 530.28 per 100,000 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 406.24-669.20), prevalence increased 17.7% to 2567.44 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1962.91-3275.69), and DALYs grew 7.7% to 1.67 per 100,000 (95% CI: 1.07-2.55). Significant sex disparities existed, with higher 2021 male incidence (620.50 per 100,000 [95% CI: 476.85-780.21]) and EAPC (0.93 [95% CI: 0.84-1.01]) versus females (434.68 per 100,000 [95% CI: 331.41-548.06]; EAPC 0.79 [95% CI: 0.75-0.85]). SDI stratification showed high-middle SDI regions bore the highest incidence (594.96 per 100,000 [95% CI: 458.84-748.69]) and prevalence (2769.36 per 100,000 [95% CI: 2115.84-3581.69]), while low SDI regions had the highest DALYs (2.31 per 100,000 [95% CI: 1.35-3.59]) and mortality (0.03 per 100,000 [95% CI: 0.02-0.05]). Prevalence increased universally across all 21 GBD regions, peaking in North Africa/Middle East (1109.96 per 100,000 [95% CI: 860.27-1395.52]). Equatorial Guinea exhibited the highest prevalence EAPC increase (2.04 [95% CI: 1.93-2.15]), contrasting with Japan's decrease. Health inequities worsened significantly, evidenced by a decline in the DALY concentration index from -0.28 (95% CI: -0.38 to -0.16) to -0.38 (95% CI: -0.47 to -0.28). Frontier analysis indicated most high-SDI nations managed lower burdens, though several mid-high SDI countries underperformed.

37061196,An integrated view of anti-inflammatory and antifibrotic targets for the treatment of NASH.,"Successful development of treatments for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its progressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), has been challenging. Because NASH and fibrosis lead to progression towards cirrhosis and clinical outcomes, approaches have either sought to attenuate metabolic dysregulation and cell injury, or directly target the inflammation and fibrosis that ensue. Targets for reducing the activation of inflammatory cascades include nuclear receptor agonists (e.g. resmetirom, lanifibranor, obeticholic acid), modulators of lipotoxicity (e.g. aramchol, acetyl-CoA carboxylase inhibitors) or modification of genetic variants (e.g. PNPLA3 gene silencing). Extrahepatic inflammatory signals from the circulation, adipose tissue or gut are targets of hormonal agonists (semaglutide, tirzepatide, FGF19/FGF21 analogues), microbiota or lifestyle interventions. Stress signals and hepatocyte death activate immune responses, engaging innate (macrophages, innate lymphocyte populations) and adaptive (auto-aggressive T cells) mechanisms. Therapies have also been developed to blunt immune cell activation, recruitment (chemokine receptor inhibitors), and responses (e.g. galectin-3 inhibitors, anti-platelet drugs). The disease-driving pathways of NASH converge to elicit fibrosis, which is reversible. The activation of hepatic stellate cells into matrix-producing myofibroblasts can be inhibited by antagonising soluble factors (e.g. integrins, cytokines), cellular crosstalk (e.g. with macrophages), and agonising nuclear receptor signalling. In advanced fibrosis, cell therapy with restorative macrophages or reprogrammed (CAR) T cells may accelerate repair through hepatic stellate cell deactivation or killing, or by enhancing matrix degradation. Heterogeneity of disease - either due to genetics or divergent disease drivers - is an obstacle to defining effective drugs for all patients with NASH that will be overcome incrementally.",2023,Aug,Journal of hepatology,Frank Tacke; Tobias Puengel; Rohit Loomba; Scott L Friedman,1962,True,2023-08-01

NAFLD datasets and the LMGs were downloaded from the GEO database and a previous publication. Key LMGs were identified through differential expression analysis, Venn diagrams, WGCNA, and three machine learning algorithms; and then nomogram models were constructed. To evaluate the model's performance, we employed calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), clinical impact curve (CIC), and receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis. Additionally, we constructed immune infiltration analysis and scRNA-seq analysis to explore the immune infiltration patterns and underlying mechanisms. Finally, qRT-PCR and Western blotting were performed to validate the expression of the key genes. The critical genes (PRKAA2 and ME1) were identified as significantly correlated with lipid metabolism in NAFLD. The nomogram model, based on the two key genes, demonstrated strong diagnostic performance for NAFLD, achieving an AUC of 0.945. The immune infiltration analysis revealed that PRKAA2 and ME1 were significantly associated with immune cells, particularly NK cells and T cells. scRNA-seq analysis classified cells into six subtypes: NK cells, monocytes and macrophages, T cells, B cells, proliferating cells, and plasmacytoid dendritic cells. Among these, T cells and NK cells were the most functionally relevant, with ME1 showing predominant expression and a strong correlation with NK cells. Experimental validation via qRT-PCR and Western blotting confirmed that only ME1 was significantly up-regulated in NAFLD. A lipid metabolism-related signature was successfully constructed, offering clinical potential for predicting NAFLD status.",2025,Oct,European journal of medical research,Yanqing Sun; Minjie Hu; Jin Yang; Dong Jia; Chun Gao; Wei Wang,1942,True,2025-10-01
41153720,Endoscopic Bariatric Therapies for Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease: Mechanistic Insights and Metabolic Implications.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is rapidly emerging as the leading cause of chronic liver disease, closely tied to rising global obesity rates. Endoscopic bariatric therapies (EBTs), including endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG), intragastric balloons (IGB), duodenal-jejunal bypass liners (DJBL), and duodenal mucosal resurfacing (DMR), offer minimally invasive interventions that target metabolic dysfunction and weight loss. This review synthesizes current evidence on the mechanisms and hepatic outcomes of EBTs in MASLD, highlighting improvements in hepatic steatosis, liver stiffness, and fibrosis biomarkers across multiple modalities. ESG is consistently associated with reductions in hepatic steatosis and fibrosis scores across multiple studies. IGB therapy improves liver stiffness and reduces hepatic fat as assessed by imaging modalities such as MRI- Proton Density Fat Fraction and ultrasound. DJBL lowers liver enzymes and improves non-invasive markers of steatohepatitis like the Fibroscan-AST score, although its effect on fibrosis appears limited. DMR demonstrates reductions in liver fat, particularly in patients with type 2 diabetes, but evidence for histological improvement in MASLD remains inconsistent. Despite their promise, most EBT studies remain limited by small sample sizes and short follow-up. Further randomized trials are needed to validate long-term efficacy and position EBTs alongside or as alternatives to surgical interventions for MASLD.",2025,Oct,Biomedicines,Wissam Ghusn; Mira Sridharan; Rachel Fromer; Muhammet Ozdemir; Madeleine G Haff; Eric J Vargas,1512,True,2025-10-01

41126373,Managing post-bariatric hypoglycemia: a systematic review of pharmacological therapies.,"Post-bariatric hypoglycemia (PBH) is a challenging and increasingly recognized complication following bariatric surgery, particularly Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB). Multiple pharmacologic interventions have been explored for managing PBH, but evidence is scattered. This study aimed to systematically synthesize the evidence from comparative studies, single-intervention trials, case reports, and registered clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of drug therapies for PBH. This systematic review and mixed treatment comparison meta-analysis was conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines and registered on Open Science Framework. Databases searched included MEDLINE, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Google Scholar, with no language or year restrictions. Eligible studies included randomized clinical trials (RCTs), observational studies, single-drug evaluations, and case reports addressing pharmacologic treatments for PBH. Risk of bias was assessed using Cochrane and Joanna Briggs Institute tools. Mixed treatment comparisons were conducted with relative risk (RR) as effect estimates, and evidence quality was assessed with the GRADE approach. Out of 2134 records screened, 13 comparative studies, five single-intervention studies, and 15 case reports were included. Among comparative studies, 12 were RCTs and one was a retrospective study. Meta-analysis revealed that anakinra and empagliflozin significantly reduced the risk of hypoglycemia compared to placebo (RR: 0.29; 95% CI: 0.09-0.91 for both). Dasiglucagon showed efficacy as a rescue agent. In single-intervention studies, pasireotide and acarbose prevented hypoglycemia in all patients. Case reports suggested variable success with agents such as liraglutide, verapamil, and semaglutide. However, the certainty of evidence was rated very low, with small sample sizes, heterogeneous definitions of PBH, and imprecise effect estimates limiting the robustness of conclusions. Pharmacologic management of PBH shows promise with agents such as anakinra, empagliflozin, pasireotide, and acarbose. However, given the considerable heterogeneity, small sample sizes, and wide confidence intervals, very low quality of effect estimates, and varied definitions of PBH, these pooled estimates should be considered hypothesis-generating only, and not confirmatory. There is an urgent need for standardized PBH definitions, patient-centered outcome measures, longer follow-up, and adequately powered RCTs to establish evidence-based therapeutic guidelines.",2025,Oct,Diabetology & metabolic syndrome,Kannan Sridharan; Gowri Sivaramakrishnan,2508,True,2025-10-01

Bemp-Ac reduced total cholesterol by about 25 %. Kidney function did not vary. The relevant anti-inflammatory effect of Bemp-Ac was confirmed by the significant improvement of liver condition (reduced CAP and LS, p = 0.042 and p = 0.008 respectively), persisting after adjustment for confounders; a reduction in white blood cells and cytokines levels was also observed. A detailed evaluation of glucose metabolism unveiled a significant reduction of GLP-1 and insulin, while glucagon and GIP were not influenced by the treatment with Bemp-Ac.

41122341,Exploring the neuroprotective role of GLP-1 agonists against Alzheimer's disease: Real-world evidence from a propensity-matched cohort.,"Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a leading cause of dementia with societal and economic burdens. While recent therapies offer disease-modifying potential, concerns remain about efficacy and safety. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), used in type 2 diabetes, show neuroprotective effects via reduced neuroinflammation and amyloid burden. To evaluate whether GLP-1RA use is associated with a reduced risk of incident dementia in adults aged ≥50 years using real-world data. We conducted a retrospective cohort study using the TriNetX platform, analyzing records from 142 healthcare organizations. Adults aged ≥50 were included, comparing GLP-1RA users (liraglutide, semaglutide, dulaglutide, exenatide, albiglutide) to non-users. Propensity-score matching balanced demographics and comorbidities. Incident dementia, defined by ICD-10 codes, was analyzed with Cox proportional-hazards models. Matched cohorts (n = 147,505 each) had similar baseline characteristics. Dementia incidence was lower in GLP-1RA users (0.20% versus 0.44%), with a hazard ratio of 0.30 (95% CI 0.28-0.33; p < 0.001).

This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. We reviewed literature from PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov up to 31 December 2024. The search strategy combined ""GLP-1″ and ""KOA"". We included studies on GLP-1 RAs and KOA in humans and animals, excluding conference abstracts, reviews, letters, case reports, and other similar types of publications. Fifteen studies were included, covering six clinical investigations and nine fundamental research studies. Clinical evidence showed GLP-1 RAs significantly improved pain scores and function while reducing KOA incidence. Mechanistic studies reveal multi-target effects, including: 1) Metabolic regulation, 2) Anti-inflammatory action, and 3) Cartilage preservation through autophagy activation and apoptosis inhibition. Safety analysis notes gastrointestinal and tumor events. At the same time, we are concerned about a declining trend in long-term compliance with GLP-1 RAs. These findings positioned GLP-1 RAs as promising disease-modifying agents for metabolic-associated KOA, particularly in obese or diabetic subpopulations. While current evidence supports therapeutic potential, confirmatory phase III trials and long-term safety monitoring are needed to establish clinical guidelines. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO2/view/CRD420250656321, Identifier, CRD420250656321.",2025,01,Frontiers in pharmacology,Yapeng Li; Lanbo Yang; Feng Li; Jia Fu; Wangyu Zhao; Xiaolong Wu; Jiayi Guo; Chen Yue,1708,True,2025-01-01

Arctigenin (ATG), a monomer of  Male C57BL/6 mice were divided into four groups: control, MASH, low-dose ATG (30 mg/kg/day), and high-dose ATG (120 mg/kg/day). MASH was induced through a choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet for eight weeks, with concurrent preventive ATG administration. Liver injury, lipid metabolism, inflammation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis were assessed. Network pharmacology was employed to identify the potential protective mechanisms of ATG. Key factors were evaluated  ATG administration prevented the progression of MASH in a dose-dependent manner. High-dose ATG significantly reduced hepatic macrophage and neutrophil infiltration, serum enzyme levels, and lipid peroxidation, while enhancing antioxidant enzyme activity. Mechanistic network pharmacology identified modulation of the NLR family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome as the central pathway underlying ATG's bioactivity. Functional analyses in lipopolysaccharide-stimulated RAW264.7 cells confirmed that ATG inhibited NLRP3 expression, pyroptosis-related protein cleavage (hereinafter referred to as GSDMD-N), and pro-inflammatory chemokine production in a concentration-dependent manner. Notably, ATG disrupted NLRP3/GSDMD-N axis activity in macrophages without causing cellular toxicity. ATG may inhibit the inflammatory cascade primarily by targeting macrophage NLRP3 inflammasomes, thereby preventing the progression of MASH.",2025,Oct,Journal of clinical and translational hepatology,Rui Xue; Lu Jiang; Qian-Ren Zhang; Qing-Jing Wang; Rui-Xu Yang; Tian-Yi Ren; Qin Pan; Jian-Gao Fan,1695,True,2025-10-01

40287313,The impact of semaglutide on liver fat assessed by serial cardiac CT scans in patients with type 2 diabetes: Results from STOP trial.,"The prevalence of hepatic steatosis continues to increase worldwide. Hepatic steatosis is increasingly recognized as an independent risk factor for cardiovascular mortality. However, there are limited options for the treatment of fatty liver. In this study, we evaluated the effect of semaglutide on liver fat as measured by non-contrast cardiac CT scans. STOP is a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the semaglutide treatment effect on coronary atherosclerosis progression (STOP) in type 2 diabetes. We utilized unenhanced cardiac CT scans to quantify liver fat based on the CT Hounsfield attenuation method. Of the 140 subjects who were originally randomized, a total of 114 individuals qualified for this study. 59 participants were in the semaglutide group and 55 were in the placebo group, and these subjects were followed for 12 months. The secondary outcome (liver fat attenuation) was quantified using non-contrast cardiac computed tomography (CT) images at both the baseline and 12-month follow-up time points. Multivariate regression models were then used to evaluate the change in liver fat content overtime. One hundred and fourteen subjects were included in the study: 61 % male, mean age of 57.8 ± 8.1 years, and mean BMI of 32.0 ± 6.7. The average of three liver measures over 12 months showed an improvement in the semaglutide group of 1.4 ± 9.0 mean HU, versus a worsening in the placebo group of 1.9 ± 9.5 mean HU. The multivariable linear regression models (after adjusting for age, gender, BMI, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, past smoking and baseline liver attenuation) showed that average liver attenuation measures improved by 4.4 HU in the semaglutide group when compared to the placebo group (p = 0.002). This result demonstrated improvement in the liver fat content within the treatment group.

In this ongoing phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, we assigned 1197 patients with biopsy-defined MASH and fibrosis stage 2 or 3 in a 2:1 ratio to receive once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg or placebo for 240 weeks. The results of a planned interim analysis conducted at week 72 involving the first 800 patients are reported here (part 1). The primary end points for part 1 were the resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of liver fibrosis and reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis. Resolution of steatohepatitis without worsening of fibrosis occurred in 62.9% of the 534 patients in the semaglutide group and in 34.3% of the 266 patients in the placebo group (estimated difference, 28.7 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 21.1 to 36.2; P<0.001). A reduction in liver fibrosis without worsening of steatohepatitis was reported in 36.8% of the patients in the semaglutide group and in 22.4% of those in the placebo group (estimated difference, 14.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 7.5 to 21.3; P<0.001). Results for the three secondary outcomes that were included in the plan to adjust for multiple testing were as follows: combined resolution of steatohepatitis and reduction in liver fibrosis was reported in 32.7% of the patients in the semaglutide group and in 16.1% of those in the placebo group (estimated difference, 16.5 percentage points; 95% CI, 10.2 to 22.8; P<0.001). The mean change in body weight was -10.5% with semaglutide and -2.0% with placebo (estimated difference, -8.5 percentage points; 95% CI, -9.6 to -7.4; P<0.001). Mean changes in bodily pain scores did not differ significantly between the two groups. Gastrointestinal adverse events were more common in the semaglutide group. In patients with MASH and moderate or advanced liver fibrosis, once-weekly semaglutide at a dose of 2.4 mg improved liver histologic results.

Therefore, the rational design of fluorescent probes for LDs detection is of significant importance. Inspired by dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran-based dyes, we designed and synthesized three pyridine malonitrile-based fluorescence probes (PMs). Among them, PM-3 exhibited a pronounced polarity-dependent fluorescence behavior, displaying strong fluorescence exclusively in low-polarity solvents such as toluene and dioxane. Moreover, PM-3 demonstrated excellent chemical stability and photostability, with an excitation wavelength compatible with the commonly used 488 nm laser. This probe can precisely label LDs and enable real-time monitoring of their dynamic Behavior in living cells. More importantly, PM-3 showed promising performance in distinguishing fatty liver tissue from normal tissue through fluorescence imaging. Taken together, PM-3 serves as a highly effective fluorescent tool for investigating the functional roles in LDs.",2025,Nov,Analytica chimica acta,Boyu Feng; Han Zhao; Yuan Cheng; Yuehua Zhang; Xu Ji; Pingzhu Zhang; Hua Chen; Chao Wei,1145,True,2025-11-01
41042228,Effects of weight-loss interventions on bone health in people living with obesity.,"Strategies to reduce weight in people living with obesity (PwO) include calorie restriction, metabolic and bariatric surgery (MBS), and anti-obesity drugs including glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1Ra), such as liraglutide and semaglutide. Although weight loss in PwO has many health benefits, it can result in increased bone loss and fracture risk. Indeed, the consequences of weight loss interventions are well known: (i) significant weight loss induced by caloric restriction and MBS results in high turnover bone loss and (ii) unlike calorie restriction, PwO experience a substantial deterioration in bone microarchitecture and strength associated with an increased risk of fracture after MBS, especially malabsorptive procedures. GLP-1 may enhance bone metabolism and improve bone quality, and liraglutide appears to have a positive effect on bone health despite significant weight loss in several rodent models. However, most of the positive effects on bone have been observed at concentrations much higher than those approved for obesity care in humans. The effects of GLP-1Ra on bone health in PwO are still limited; however, significant weight loss induced by GLP-1Ra may also result in accelerated bone turnover and bone loss, and semaglutide could lead to an increased risk of fractures in the at-risk population. The mechanisms responsible for the adverse skeletal effects of MBS are not yet fully understood, and there are insufficient human studies supporting pathophysiological hypotheses. However, data suggest that multiple mechanisms are involved, including nutritional factors, mechanical unloading, hormonal factors, adipokines, and alterations in the gut microbiome. Recommendations for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis secondary to MBS are now available, and the efficacy of anti-osteoporosis medications in preventing bone loss has been evaluated in two randomized controlled trials. Priorities for future research include the development of effective approaches to reduce fracture risk in PwO following MBS and investigation of the effects of anti-obesity drugs on bone health. Weight loss can improve health for people living with obesity, but it may also weaken bones and increase fracture risk. Metabolic and bariatric surgery causes the biggest bone problems, while new weight-loss medicines including GLP-1 receptor agonists may also affect bone health. More research is needed to find safe ways to protect bones while supporting weight loss.",2025,Oct,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research,Julien Paccou; Claudia Gagnon; Elaine W Yu; Clifford J Rosen,2499,True,2025-10-01
41032460,Assessment of Gastric Content Using Gastric Ultrasound in Patients on Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists Before Anesthesia.,"The use of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) has significantly increased in recent years. GLP-1 RAs delay gastric emptying, resulting in early satiety and weight loss. This may increase the risk of pulmonary aspiration of residual gastric contents (RGC) during anesthesia delivery. Evidence is urgently needed to guide perioperative anesthesia management for patients taking GLP-1 RAs. This study evaluated preoperative factors that may be associated with high RGC. Adult patients who were taking GLP-1 RAs and scheduled to receive anesthesia at 3 hospitals between June 30, 2023, and August 15, 2024, were evaluated via preoperative point-of-care gastric ultrasonography (GUS). The primary outcome was high RGC, defined by the presence of solids food or >1.5 mL/kg of clear liquids on GUS, and its association with preoperative factors (eg, existing medical conditions, indication and route of taking GLP-1 RAs, length of taking GLP-1 RAs, days of withholding GLP-1 RAs before surgery, and preoperative fasting periods). Data are presented as median (interquartile range [IQR]). Among the 316 patients (60.9 years [52.1-68.9] of age; 167 [52.8%] females) included in the study, 113 (35.8%) had high RGC. A higher percentage (5.3%; 6/113) of patients in the high RGC group had an opioid prescription for pain management within 3 months of the GUS assessment compared to the low RGC group (1.0%; 2/203; P = .027). No statistical difference was found between the groups in other existing medical conditions, indication and route of taking GLP-1 RAs, and length of taking GLP-1 RAs. Of the 294 patients taking weekly injections, there were 187 (63.6%) with low RGC and 107 (36.4%) with high RGC. Patients with low RGC withheld their GLP-1 RAs for 8 days [5-10], while patients with high RGC withheld for 6 days [3-9] (P = .003). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis found ≤7.5 days of withholding the medication as cutoff for increased prevalence of high RGC in patients taking GLP-1 RA injections. Patients with low RGC fasted from solid food for 20.0 hours [14.8-40.8], and patients with high RGC fasted from solid food for 15.0 hours [12.8-19.0] (P < .001). ROC found ≤21.3 hours of fasting from solid food as the cutoff for increased prevalence of high RGC. GLP-1 RA usage may delay gastric emptying. In preoperatively fasting adults, ≤7.5 days of withholding injections and ≤21.3 hours of fasting from solid food are associated with high RGC.",2025,Oct,Anesthesia and analgesia,Sher-Lu Pai; Sindhuja R Nimma; W Brian Beam; Beth A VanderWielen; Hari K Kalagara; Layne M Bettini; Soojie Yu; Emily E Sharpe; Monica W Harbell,2477,True,2025-10-01
41131087,Metabolomics for searching non-invasive biomarkers of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in youth with vertical HIV.,"In adults living with HIV, non-invasive biomarkers have been described for the early identification of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver diseases (MASLD). However, this issue remains unexplored in children and young people with vertical HIV (YWVH), among whom MASLD prevalence is around 30%. To identify biomarkers associated with MASLD in YWVH under sustained viral suppression with antiretroviral therapy, we analysed plasma lipid species, plasma bile acid profile, and gut microbiome composition in a cross-sectional cohort of 10 YWVH with MASLD and 19 YWVH without clinical evidence of MASLD (control). Here we show that YWVH with MASLD have significantly increased circulating levels of eight specific lipid molecules and one bile acid, ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA). UDCA and two triglycerides (TG54:5 and TG56:7) are identified as key biomolecules with strong discriminatory potential. The regression model incorporating these markers, along with hepatic steatosis index (HSI) and triglycerides-glucose index (TyG), demonstrates the highest predictive accuracy for MASLD (AUC of 0.932). UDCA correlates positively with Blautia and Collinsella genus (p = 0.040 and p = 0.021, respectively), and negatively with Faecalibacterium (p = 0.030). Notably, principal component analysis based on bile acid levels reveals two possible subpopulations within the control group, one potentially at higher risk for MASLD. Combining UDCA, TG54:5 and TG56:7 with the validated HSI score provides a potential model with high specificity and sensitivity for predicting MASLD in YWVH. Moreover, early alterations in the bile acid profile may help identify YWVH at risk of developing MASLD. Children and young people who acquired HIV at birth are increasingly developing liver problems, such as metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), a condition caused by fat accumulation in the liver. While there are non-invasive tools for early detection in adults, no biomarkers are currently available for children and youth. This preliminary study aims to identify simple, blood-based markers that could support early detection of MASLD in this population. Blood and stool samples from 29 participants were analysed to examine circulating fats, bile acids, and gut bacteria. The results indicate that one bile acid and two triglycerides were higher in those with MASLD and, when combined with clinical scores, could predict the disease. These findings may support earlier diagnosis and help prevent liver damage.",2025,Oct,Communications medicine,Silvia Chafino; Laura Tarancon-Diez; Jara Hurtado-Gallego; Marina Flores-Piñas; Sonia Alcolea; Antonio Olveira; María Luisa Navarro; Salvador Fernández-Arroyo; Consuelo Viladés; Maria Luisa Montes; Francesc Vidal; Joaquim Peraire; Anna Rull; Talía Sainz,2530,True,2025-10-01
39062555,Bile Acids as Emerging Players at the Intersection of Steatotic Liver Disease and Cardiovascular Diseases.,"Affecting approximately 25% of the global population, steatotic liver disease (SLD) poses a significant health concern. SLD ranges from simple steatosis to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and fibrosis with a risk of severe liver complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. SLD is associated with obesity, atherogenic dyslipidaemia, and insulin resistance, increasing cardiovascular risks. As such, identifying SLD is vital for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and treatment. Bile acids (BAs) have critical roles in lipid digestion and are signalling molecules regulating glucose and lipid metabolism and influencing gut microbiota balance. BAs have been identified as critical mediators in cardiovascular health, influencing vascular tone, cholesterol homeostasis, and inflammatory responses. The cardio-protective or harmful effects of BAs depend on their concentration and composition in circulation. The effects of certain BAs occur through the activation of a group of receptors, which reduce atherosclerosis and modulate cardiac functions. Thus, manipulating BA receptors could offer new avenues for treating not only liver diseases but also CVDs linked to metabolic dysfunctions. In conclusion, this review discusses the intricate interplay between BAs, metabolic pathways, and hepatic and extrahepatic diseases. We also highlight the necessity for further research to improve our understanding of how modifying BA characteristics affects or ameliorates disease.",2024,Jul,Biomolecules,Josh Bilson; Eleonora Scorletti; Jonathan R Swann; Christopher D Byrne,1511,True,2024-07-01
38504284,"CVOT Summit Report 2023: new cardiovascular, kidney, and metabolic outcomes.","The 9th Cardiovascular Outcome Trial (CVOT) Summit: Congress on Cardiovascular, Kidney, and Metabolic Outcomes was held virtually on November 30-December 1, 2023. This reference congress served as a platform for in-depth discussions and exchange on recently completed outcomes trials including dapagliflozin (DAPA-MI), semaglutide (SELECT and STEP-HFpEF) and bempedoic acid (CLEAR Outcomes), and the advances they represent in reducing the risk of major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), improving metabolic outcomes, and treating obesity-related heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). A broad audience of endocrinologists, diabetologists, cardiologists, nephrologists and primary care physicians participated in online discussions on guideline updates for the management of cardiovascular disease (CVD) in diabetes, heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD); advances in the management of type 1 diabetes (T1D) and its comorbidities; advances in the management of CKD with SGLT2 inhibitors and non-steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (nsMRAs); and advances in the treatment of obesity with GLP-1 and dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonists. The association of diabetes and obesity with nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH; metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis, MASH) and cancer and possible treatments for these complications were also explored. It is generally assumed that treatment of chronic diseases is equally effective for all patients. However, as discussed at the Summit, this assumption may not be true. Therefore, it is important to enroll patients from diverse racial and ethnic groups in clinical trials and to analyze patient-reported outcomes to assess treatment efficacy, and to develop innovative approaches to tailor medications to those who benefit most with minimal side effects. Other keys to a successful management of diabetes and comorbidities, including dementia, entail the use of continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology and the implementation of appropriate patient-physician communication strategies.

41072803,Measuring Health Related Quality of Life and Patient-Reported Outcomes in Chronic Liver Disease.,"Chronic liver disease (CLD) is the 11th leading cause of death worldwide, responsible for over two million deaths annually, and the 15th leading cause of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). To fully capture the burden of CLD, it is essential to assess patient-reported outcomes (PROs) which is defined as patients' perspectives on their health-related quality of life (HRQL), functional status, daily well-being, and fatigue. Importantly, PROs are self-reported using validated instruments, without interpretation or influence from healthcare providers, family members, or caregivers. Regardless of etiology, patients with CLD consistently report impaired HRQL, reduced work productivity, and difficulty with daily functioning. In fact, these impairments worsen as liver disease progresses but may improve with regression of liver disease due to treatment. Across disease causes, factors most strongly associated with poorer PROs include clinically significant fatigue, anxiety, depression, advanced histologic fibrosis (or non-invasive test [NIT] equivalents), and female sex. In this review, we summarize the historical development and significance of PROs, highlight commonly used PRO instruments [e.g., Short Form (SF)-36, the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ), the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-Specific Health Problem (WPAI-SHP), the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue (FACIT-F), EQ-5D], and discuss key considerations for selecting PRO tools(validity, reliability, responsiveness, the minimally clinically important difference). We review the current literature on CLD symptom burden and its relationship with PROs concluding that PRO measurement incorporation into clinical trials and clinical practice is imperative to appreciate patients' perspectives about their liver disease and/or its treatment. PROs enhance communication between healthcare providers and patients regarding treatment expectations potentially improving outcomes.",2025,Oct,Journal of hepatology,Zobair M Younossi; Maria Stepanova; Jörn M Schattenberg; Linda Henry,1991,True,2025-10-01
39889902,An in vitro 3D spheroid model with liver steatosis and fibrosis on microwell arrays for drug efficacy evaluation.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is now the most common chronic liver disease worldwide, affecting more than 30 percent of adults. The most severe form of MASLD, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), is characterized by necrotizing inflammation and rapid fibrosis progression, often leading to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, only Resmetirom is approved for the treatment of MASH one of the main reasons is the absence of representative in vivo or in vitro models for MASH. To address this challenge, we developed a high-throughput 3D spheroid model consisting of human hepatocellular carcinoma cells (HepG2) and human hepatic stellate cells (LX-2) on microwell arrays. This model, induced with free fatty acids (FFA) to simulate steatosis and fibrosis, enables the assessment of efficacy and mechanisms for potential anti-MASH drugs. Our findings demonstrate that this in vitro spheroid model replicates key pathological features of human MASLD, including steatosis, oxidative stress, and fibrosis. Upon validation, we selected pirfenidone (PFD) and yinfenidone (AC-003), which are commonly used to treat idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), to test their anti-MASH efficacy. Treatment with these drugs showed that they could regulate lipid synthesis and metabolism genes, reduce lipid accumulation, oxidative stress, and fibrosis levels. This 3D spheroid model represents a straightforward and efficient tool for screening anti-MASH drugs and investigating the molecular mechanisms of drug action.",2025,Mar,Journal of biotechnology,Jiamin Chen; Ping Wang; Zhanpeng Li; Jieyi Wu; Fang Tang; Niao Yang; Bohong Cen; Cuiyin Xie; Yufan Yang; Ziyan Yang; Chuwen Zhang; Xiangcao Yao; Zhongyuan Xu,1570,True,2025-03-01

41042549,RISING STARS: Effects of a GLP-1 receptor polymorphism on responses to liraglutide.,"The rs6923761 (Gly168Ser) missense variant in the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) has been associated with favorable anthropometric and metabolic parameters in individuals with obesity but decreased responsiveness to incretin-based therapies. Here, we performed a pre-specified analysis of a randomized-controlled trial in individuals with obesity and pre-diabetes comparing treatment with the GLP-1R agonist liraglutide, the dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitor sitagliptin or hypocaloric diet, and evaluated the effects of the rs6923761 variant on outcomes. We found significantly greater weight loss to liraglutide with each copy of the variant allele present, indicating a gene dose effect. In addition, individuals with the variant allele exhibited a significant reduction in the pro-thrombotic and pro-inflammatory factor plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 after liraglutide treatment. There was no effect of genotype on fasting glucose after liraglutide treatment, yet individuals with the variant allele exhibited decreased responsiveness to liraglutide and hypocaloric diet in measurements of fasting insulin, C-peptide, glucagon, and HOMA-IR. In conclusion, we found that the GLP-1R rs6923761 variant exerts a dual impact on liraglutide efficacy-enhancing weight loss while diminishing metabolic benefits. The observed associations could be consistent with the constitutive activation of the GLP-1R in the presence of this variant with reduced activation/signaling in response to pharmacologic agents, a pattern that has been observed with the rs10305492 variant in animal models. Future studies are needed to investigate the molecular mechanisms of associations with the rs6923761 variant.",2025,Oct,The Journal of endocrinology,Mona Mashayekhi; Bilgunay Ilkin Safa; Hui Nian; Jessica K Devin; Jorge L Gamboa; Chang Yu; Rui Chen; Joshua A Beckman; John R Koethe; Heidi J Silver; Kevin Niswender; James M Luther; Nancy J Brown,1706,True,2025-10-01
39493200,Effectiveness of Resmetirom in Reducing Cholesterol Levels in Patients With Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with metabolic syndrome and increased cardiovascular risk. Resmetirom, a novel liver-directed selective thyroid hormone receptor-β (THR-β) agonist, has shown promise in addressing both hepatic and systemic lipid metabolism. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the efficacy of resmetirom in improving cholesterol levels in NASH patients. A systematic literature search was conducted across multiple databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and ClinicalTrials.gov, identifying three randomized controlled trials for inclusion. The meta-analysis revealed that resmetirom significantly reduced low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared to placebo (MD: -23.62; 95% CI: -37.32 to -9.93; p < 0.001). Similarly, triglyceride (TG) levels showed a significant reduction in the resmetirom group (MD: -33.86; 95% CI: -47.79 to -19.92; p < 0.001). Importantly, there was no significant difference in the risk of serious adverse events between resmetirom and placebo groups (RR: 1.09; 95% CI: 0.73 to 1.63; p = 0.67). These findings suggest that resmetirom effectively improves lipid profiles in NASH patients without compromising safety. However, the analysis was limited by the small number of studies, all from the same research group, and high heterogeneity in results. Future research should include more diverse studies, longer follow-up periods, and cost-effectiveness evaluations. Despite these limitations, resmetirom shows promise as a potential treatment for managing dyslipidemia and cardiovascular risk in NASH patients, potentially influencing future treatment guidelines for both liver and cardiovascular health in this population.",2024,Oct,Cureus,Estifanos Bejitual; Muhammad Faisal Awais; Dhruvi Modi; Ushna Gul; Kinan Obeidat; Najeeha Ahmed; Muhammad Daniyal Waheed; Shamsha Hirani,1800,True,2024-10-01
41075131,Healthy mitochondria attenuate metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis by restoring cell metabolism.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has become a major global health issue. Mitochondrial damage plays a crucial role in the development and progression of MASH. Therefore, it is speculated that mitochondrial transplantation therapy, which could replace dysfunctional mitochondria with normal ones, might potentially restore the liver cell metabolism of MASH. In palmitate-damaged AML-12 hepatocytes, exogenous mitochondria could eliminate lipid deposits and recover cell viability. However, in transforming growth factor β (TGF-β)-activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), the exogenous mitochondria showed the capability to inhibit the generation of α-smooth muscle actin (α-SMA) and collagen I. Moreover, the mechanism by which the exogenous mitochondria initiated the mitochondria-nucleus signaling pathway of liver cells was studied. The results showed the mitochondria could prevent metabolism disorders in the liver cells by regulating silent information regulator 1 (SIRT1) activity. Subsequently, a MASH animal model was established by the administration of a high-fat diet and the intraperitoneal injection of carbon tetrachloride to Kunming mice. The results indicated that the mitochondrial therapy significantly inhibited the livery injury and restored liver cell function in the experimental MASH mice (p < 0.01). The mitochondrial therapy would be a promising strategy to improve MASH pathological features, which could be developed as a new treatment option against MASH.",2025,Oct,Molecular biomedicine,Peiyu Zhou; Jingli Li; Yafang Xie; Xiaorong Li; Zhihong Cui; Ailing Fu,1507,True,2025-10-01
41116973,GLP-1R Agonists Improve Ocular Surface Parameters in Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.,"Dry eye disease (DED) is a prevalent ocular surface disorder frequently associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). While glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated systemic anti-inflammatory and vascular benefits beyond glycemic control, their potential impact on tear film parameters remains largely unexplored. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of GLP-1 RAs on ocular surface health in patients with T2DM. In this single-center case-control study, 35 patients with T2DM receiving glucose-lowering therapies were enrolled. Participants were divided into two groups: 21 patients treated with GLP-1 RAs (alone or in combination with other agents) and 14 patients treated with non-GLP-1 RA glucose-lowering medications. Ocular surface parameters-including Schirmer I test and tear breakup time (TBUT)-were assessed and compared between groups. Patients receiving GLP-1 RAs demonstrated significantly higher Schirmer I test values (median 15 mm, range 1-33) compared to non-GLP-1 RA users (median 7.5 mm, range 0-40;  GLP-1 receptor agonist therapy is associated with improved tear production and tear film stability in patients with type 2 diabetes, suggesting a potential protective effect on the ocular surface.

41123096,"Service delivery, behavioural, and self-management interventions for children with epilepsy.","In the UK, approximately one in 1000 children aged zero to four years have epilepsy, and one in 200 children between the ages of five and 19 have epilepsy. There is a need to focus on models of service delivery and therapies that target cognitive, psychological, and behavioural aspects to improve seizure control and quality of life. To assess the effects of service delivery, behavioural, and self-management inventions on seizure control and health-related quality of life in children with epilepsy. We used the Cochrane Register of Studies, MEDLINE, and two other databases, together with reference checking and contact with study authors, to identify the studies included in the review. The latest search date was 21 August 2023. We included randomised controlled trials (RCTs) or quasi-RCTs of any design (double/single-blinded, unblinded; parallel, cross-over, or cluster). We included behavioural or self-management interventions aimed at improving seizure control in children with epilepsy (average age 18 years or under), and any service delivery interventions targeting children with epilepsy (average age 18 years or under), their parents/carers, or both. Our primary outcome was seizure control (i.e. change in seizure frequency, seizure freedom). Our secondary outcomes were: seizure severity, overall quality of life and other aspects of quality of life (such as anxiety and depression), medication usage, knowledge, general health, social and psychological function, and adverse events. We classified outcomes as short-term (up to six months) or long-term (over six months). At least two review authors independently screened all papers, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias. Data analysis was performed by one review author and checked by at least one other review author. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for (1) seizure control and (2) participant-reported overall quality of life using validated scales. We included six studies with a total of 468 randomised participants: four behavioural studies (subcategorised into psycho-behavioural interventions investigated in three studies involving 205 children; and one mind-body intervention with 20 children) and two service delivery studies, involving 243 adult carers of children with epilepsy. Most studies had a high risk of performance bias, detection bias, or both (for lack of or inadequate blinding of participants, personnel, or outcome assessors). The risk of bias was low or unclear across all other domains. Due to the studies' heterogeneity, we were unable to conduct a meta-analysis for any intervention or outcome. We identified no eligible self-management interventions. Psycho-behavioural interventions Compared to usual care, there was a small important effect showing that systemic family therapy may reduce seizure frequency slightly per month at three months (mean difference (MD) in seizure frequency per month -1.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) -3.84 to -0.12; 1 study, 104 participants; low-certainty evidence). Evidence was lacking for differences in seizure frequency between behavioural interventions and control groups in the other two studies (94 participants; results reported descriptively at 10 weeks, three months, and 12 months). Compared to usual care, a manual-based psychosocial group intervention may result in little to no difference in quality of life at three months, but the evidence is very uncertain (Paediatric Quality of Life Inventory: MD -1.40, 95% CI -8.21 to 5.41; 1 study, 76 participants; very low-certainty evidence; Glasgow Epilepsy Outcome Scale for Young Persons: MD -0.33, 95% CI -5.68 to 5.02; P = 0.90; 1 study, 76 participants; very low-certainty evidence). The other two psycho-behavioural studies did not assess overall quality of life. Mind-body interventions It is uncertain whether a mind-body intervention (yoga) made a difference in the number of participants who were seizure-free at three months (seizure freedom MD 1.62, 95% CI 0.97 to 2.69; 1 study, 20 participants; low-certainty evidence). This study did not measure quality of life. Service delivery interventions One service delivery intervention (a clinical pharmacist-led education intervention) assessed seizure control and overall quality of life versus usual care. The evidence is very uncertain whether there were differences in seizure freedom (MD 1.32, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.00; 1 study, 71 participants; very low-certainty evidence) or overall quality of life at two months (MD 10.46, 95% CI 1.82 to 19.10; 1 study, 71 participants; very low-certainty evidence). Quality of life was assessed by adult carers, not the children themselves. The other service delivery intervention ('WeChat'-based remote follow-up after hospital discharge) did not evaluate seizure control and only measured aspects of quality of life (anxiety and depression, 162 participants), rather than overall quality of life. No adverse events were reported in any of the six included studies. We included six studies in this review, each examining a different intervention, reporting on different outcomes, and involving varied populations. All studies had several limitations, including small sample sizes, lack of blinding, and inconsistent outcome measurement across studies. Overall, the available evidence was of low to very low certainty. Results for long-term (≥ six months) outcomes were very limited for any type of intervention. High-quality RCTs assessing service delivery, behavioural, and self-management interventions in children and adolescents with epilepsy are needed. Trials should assess short-term (≤ six months) and long-term (> six months) outcomes.

Race-related stress may be a source of PMIEs, but no studies have investigated how PMIE exposures differ by racial or ethnic identity. This study explored variations in reported rates of PMIEs among Black/African American, White, Hispanic/Latino/a/e, and non-Hispanic/Latino/a/e United States post-9/11 combat veterans. Secondary data analysis were conducted using observational cohort data from a repository on post-deployment functioning among combat veterans (n = 487). Participants completed two measures of PMIEs (Moral Injury Questionnaire - Military Version [MIQ-M], Currier et al., 2015; Moral Injury Events Scale [MIES], Nash et al., 2013) and measures of combat exposure and trauma exposure. Participants self-identified as White (57 %), Black or African American (31 %), Hispanic/Latino/a/e (20 %), and non-Hispanic/Latino/a/e (80.5 %). Racial/ethnic differences were analyzed at the item level using item response theory models. All latent mean differences between racial and ethnic groups on the PMIE measures were small. The largest difference was between Black/African American and White veterans on the MIES (d = 0.38) and the smallest difference was between Hispanic/Latino/a/e and non-Hispanic/Latino/a/e veterans on trauma exposure (d = -0.01). Possible reasons for results include that: 1) between-group differences are negligible; 2) differences are greater within groups than between groups; 3) the MIES and MIQ-M do not assess race-based PMIEs.

41158620,GLP-1 receptor agonists synergistic effects of metabolic reprogramming and cardioprotection.,"Diabetes mellitus, a condition that significantly elevates the incidence and mortality risks associated with cardiovascular diseases, exacerbates the disease burden in China. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have garnered considerable attention, as they not only regulate blood glucose but also play a vital role in safeguarding the cardiovascular system. Recent research shows that metabolic reprogramming is a key mechanism for the cardioprotective effects of GLP-1RAs. GLP-1RAs can achieve metabolic reprogramming by regulating fatty acid, glucose, and ketone body metabolism, as well as mitochondrial function. This process optimizes cardiac energy metabolism, alleviates oxidative stress, and reduces the risk of cardiovascular diseases.

40983878,Peptides IPVP and LPIA Induce Insulin Secretion in a 2-Tiered Caco-2-STC-1/BRIN-BD11 Cell Model.,"The insulin release effects of two peptides, IPVP and LPIA, derived from a brewers' spent grain (BSG) protein hydrolysate, were investigated using a two-tiered Caco-2 and STC-1 (apical: intestinal and enteroendocrine cells, respectively)/BRIN-BD11 (basolateral: pancreatic cells) cell model. Both peptides significantly enhanced insulin secretion in BRIN-BD11 cells (29.64 ± 3.30 and 28.30 ± 1.98 pM insulin for LPIA and IPVP, respectively) following their inclusion on the apical side. However, the direct exposure of BRIN-BD11 cells to peptides did not induce significant changes in insulin secretion, suggesting an indirect mode of action. LPIA significantly increased glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) levels (43.83 ± 9.25 pM), a known enhancer of insulin release, after 2 h of incubation during Caco-2 and STC-1 cell coculture.

We hypothesized that clinical features present in electronic health records (EHR) could be extracted early to characterize patients with MASLD who are at high risk of early mortality and that machine learning models would predict mortality better than noninvasive assessments of liver disease/fibrosis. Using previously published criteria for MASLD, applied to data from the US Veterans Affairs EHR, we identified a cohort of 13,071 patients between 2000 and 2018 who had an initial diagnosis of MASLD without clinical evidence of cirrhosis. We subsequently used machine-learning and conducted analysis of variance and logistic regression to identify clinical variables to characterize cirrhosis risk and predict mortality within the ensuing 5-years. The average age of the cohort was 60 years, had a BMI of 31, and 34% diabetes prevalence. Patients who progressed to cirrhosis were younger when first diagnosed with MASLD (56), had a higher BMI (33), and had significantly higher noninvasive fibrosis scores. Having diabetes at index MASLD diagnosis significantly increased the risk of developing cirrhosis and doubled the risk cirrhosis plus HCC (2.09 CI:1.217-3.63). Our machine-learning model performed significantly better than FIB-4 at predicting mortality within 5-years of being diagnosed with MASLD (AUC 83% vs 68%). Our data suggest that machine learning models based on data extracted from the EHR early during MASLD can identify patients likely to develop cirrhosis and predict short term mortality.",2025,01,PloS one,Lewis J Frey; Michael Fuchs; Ralph C Ward; Mulugeta Gebregziabher; Ahmad Basil Nasir; Yamini Natarajan; Andrew Schreiner; Don C Rockey; Wing-Kin Syn,1681,True,2025-01-01

Achieving remission through pharmacologic, dietary, and surgical interventions is now an attainable goal for a subset of patients. This systematic review synthesizes evidence from clinical trials, emerging pharmacologic interventions, and current guidelines for diabetes remission. We explore the mechanisms of diabetes reversal, highlighting novel agents such as glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, dual glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 agonists, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. This review also addresses the long-term sustainability of remission, epidemiological trends in India, and current treatment recommendations, integrating data from major studies. The findings underscore the need for a patient-centered, evidence-based approach to diabetes management.

41033655,Evaluation of the effects of metformin on gut functions and microbiota and their contribution to improving glucose tolerance in diabetic mice.,"Although the mechanism of action of the antidiabetic drug metformin is still a matter of discussions, increasing evidence points to a pivotal role of the gut. Aiming to clarify whether metformin-induced changes in the intestinal tract directly contribute to metabolic improvement, we evaluated the effects of escalating doses (from 50 to 200 mg/kg/day) of metformin orally administered for 4 weeks in mice made glucose intolerant by ten weeks of high fat high sucrose diet. Several intestinal parameters were studied, including caecal microbiota composition and bile acids profile, ileal FXR signaling, abundance of GLP1-producing cells and goblet cells and blood metabolome. Metformin restored glucose tolerance, fasting insulinemia and HOMA-IR index in a dose-dependent manner. Only a subset of gut-related effects, including mucus production and GLP-1 expression, exhibited a parallel dose-response relationship, suggesting a possible contribution to the observed metabolic improvements. In contrast, other changes, including ileal Fxr-Fgf15 inhibition and hepatic ceramide reduction did not scale with dose, suggesting they are not the main drivers of metformin dose-dependent effects on glycemic control. We also pointed out marked differential sensitivity of gut bacteria to metformin supporting complex interactions of the drug with the microbial ecosystem. Finally, metformin enhanced the proliferation of intestinal epithelium, resulting in increased length of ileal villi. Altogether, this study offers new insights into the metformin mechanism of action and revealed potential novel microbial biomarkers and targets for enhancing its therapeutic efficacy.",2025,Sep,Molecular metabolism,Murielle Godet; Emmanuelle Meugnier; Oriane Vitalis; Nadia Bendridi; Aurélie Vieille-Marchiset; Nathalie Vega; Bérengère Benoit; Claudie Pinteur; Dominique Rainteau; David Cheillan; Marie-Caroline Michalski; Karim Chikh; Hubert Vidal,1667,True,2025-09-01
38474208,Semaglutide Improves Liver Steatosis and De Novo Lipogenesis Markers in Obese and Type-2-Diabetic Mice with Metabolic-Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"Metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a prevalent clinical condition associated with elevated morbidity and mortality rates. Patients with MASLD treated with semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, demonstrate improvement in terms of liver damage. However, the mechanisms underlaying this beneficial effect are not yet fully elucidated. We investigated the efficacy of semaglutide in halting MASLD progression using a genetic mouse model of diabesity. Leptin-receptor-deficient mice with obesity and diabetes (BKS db/db) were either untreated or administered with semaglutide for 11 weeks. Changes in food and water intake, body weight and glycemia were monitored throughout the study. Body fat composition was assessed by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Upon sacrifice, serum biochemical parameters, liver morphology, lipidomic profile and liver-lipid-related pathways were evaluated. The semaglutide-treated mice exhibited lower levels of glycemia, body weight, serum markers of liver dysfunction and total and percentage of fat mass compared to untreated db/db mice without a significant reduction in food intake. Histologically, semaglutide reduced hepatic steatosis, hepatocellular ballooning and intrahepatic triglycerides. Furthermore, the treatment ameliorated the hepatic expression of de novo lipogenesis markers and modified lipid composition by increasing the amount of polyunsaturated fatty acids. The administration of semaglutide to leptin-receptor-deficient, hyperphagic and diabetic mice resulted in the amelioration of MASLD, likely independently of daily caloric intake, suggesting a direct effect of semaglutide on the liver through modulation of the lipid profile.",2024,Mar,International journal of molecular sciences,Manuel Soto-Catalán; Lucas Opazo-Ríos; Hernán Quiceno; Iolanda Lázaro; Juan Antonio Moreno; Carmen Gómez-Guerrero; Jesús Egido; Sebastian Mas-Fontao,1735,True,2024-03-01

We assessed health-related quality of life (HRQL) in patients with MASH treated with resmetirom. Patients with MASH/NASH without cirrhosis and with confirmed/suspected fibrosis were enrolled in a 54-month double-blind randomized placebo-controlled phase III clinical trial with serial biopsy assessments at baseline and week 52 (MAESTRO-NASH, NCT03900429). HRQL was assessed using Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire-NASH (CLDQ-NAFLD) and Liver Disease Quality of Life (LDQOL). Baseline HRQL score changes by treatment group (resmetirom 80 mg, resmetirom 100 mg, or placebo) and histological response (improvement of fibrosis without worsening of NAFLD activity score or resolution of MASH/NASH without worsening of fibrosis) were compared after 52 weeks.

41084518,A systematic review and meta-analysis comparing the cardiovascular effects of sodium-glucose co-transporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists in type 2 diabetes.,"Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors and glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists have been shown to improve cardiovascular health. This meta-analysis aims to directly compare their cardiovascular outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients (T2DM). We searched Medline, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science from inception to August 2025 for observational studies that compared SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists in type 2 diabetes patients and baseline cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The primary outcomes were Major Adverse Cardiovascular Events (MACE) and heart failure (HF), while the secondary outcomes included all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction (MI), and stroke. The pooled hazard ratio with 95% confidence interval (CI) was employed through a random-effects model, and a p-value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Nineteen studies comprising 1,893,359 patients (1,182,641; SGLT2 inhibitors,710,718; GLP-1 agonists). Compared to GLP-1 agonist, SGLT2 inhibitor use was associated with a significant 18% reduced risk of heart failure in T2DM patients, while a non significantly reduced risk of MACE, all-cause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, myocardial infarction, and stroke. In T2DM patients with pre-existing CVD, SGLT2 inhibitors showed a significant 14% reduced risk of heart failure, 10% reduced risk of myocardial infarction, and 7% borderline reduced risk of all-cause mortality compared to GLP-1 agonists. In T2DM patients without pre-existing CVD, SGLT2 inhibitors demonstrated a significant 17% reduced risk of heart failure, with a non-significant reduction in MACE, all-cause mortality, and myocardial infarction compared to GLP-1 agonists, and a non-significantly increased risk of cardiovascular mortality and stroke. Use of SGLT2 inhibitors was associated with a lower risk of HF in T2DM, along with a lower risk of HF, MI, and all-cause mortality with pre-existing CVD compared to GLP-1 agonists. However, high heterogeneity and a lack of RCTs warrant cautious clinical implications.

Adult patients with T2DM initiating GLP-1 RA therapy were matched 1:1 with non-users based on demographics, comorbidities, and medication use. Patients with pre-existing LDD or prior lumbar spine surgery were excluded. Primary outcome was the incidence of LDD; secondary outcome was lumbar spine surgery. Outcomes were assessed at 3- and 5-year intervals, and odds ratios (ORs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated.ResultsA total of 196 435 matched pairs were analyzed. At 3 years, GLP-1 RA users had a lower incidence of LDD (11.9% vs 13.3%; OR 0.89, 95% CI: 0.87-0.91). At 5 years, this difference widened (14.6% vs 18.7%; OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.73-0.74). Lumbar spine surgery rates were similar at 3 years (0.4% in both groups; OR 1.03, 95% CI: 0.93-1.14), but significantly lower in GLP-1 RA users at 5 years (0.5% vs 0.6%; OR 0.86, 95% CI: 0.78-0.92).ConclusionsGLP-1 RA use is associated with a lower long-term risk of developing LDD and undergoing lumbar spine surgery in patients with T2DM.

41128495,"GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and Blood Pressure: A State-of-the-Art Review of Mechanisms, Evidence, and Clinical Implications.","Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes and, more recently, for weight management among individuals without diabetes. Beyond their metabolic effects, growing evidence suggests that GLP-1 RAs produce modest reductions in blood pressure (BP), typically 2 to 5 mmHg systolic, across diverse populations with diabetes, obesity, or at high cardiovascular risk. These reductions appear to be driven primarily by weight loss, with additional contributions from potential weight-independent mechanisms such as natriuresis, improved endothelial function, and attenuation of vascular inflammation. Although smaller in magnitude than those achieved with traditional antihypertensive drugs, the BP-lowering effects of GLP-1 RAs can translate into meaningful cardiovascular risk reduction at the population level and provide additive BP benefit when used alongside conventional therapies. Among individuals with hypertension, GLP-1 RAs are generally well tolerated, although small increases in heart rate and potential interactions with volume-regulating medications may warrant clinical attention. This review the synthesizes current evidence on the mechanisms by which GLP-1 RAs affect BP, their clinical effects across populations, and the implications for patient care. We discuss subpopulations who may benefit from their BP-lowering effects, identify limitations in the existing evidence, and explore future directions for research.

Vitamin E, a potent antioxidant, has been proposed to modulate adipokine secretion, but existing studies report inconsistent findings. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the impact of vitamin E oral supplementation on serum adiponectin and leptin levels in adults. Systematic searches were performed in major electronic databases up to August 2025 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Extracted data were analyzed using STATA, and pooled effect estimates were calculated as weighted mean differences (WMDs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs).

39089233,Semaglutide Ameliorates Hepatocyte Steatosis in a Cell Co-Culture System by Downregulating the IRE1α-XBP1-C/EBPα Signaling Pathway in Macrophages.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is currently the most common type of chronic liver disease. Semaglutide is a glucose-lowering drug administered for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and is clinically effective in the treatment of NAFLD. X-box binding protein 1 (XBP1) is related to the pathogenesis of both NAFLD and T2DM. The aim of the present study was to demonstrate whether the underlying mechanism of semaglutide treatment for NAFLD is via downregulation of the inositol-requiring transmembrane kinase/endonuclease-1α (IRE1α)-XBP1-CCAAT/enhancer binding protein α (C/EBPα) signaling pathway in macrophages. In the present study, NAFLD cell modeling was induced by oleic acid (0.4 m<sc>m</sc>) and palmitic acid (0.2 m<sc>m</sc>). Hepatocytes (AML12) and macrophages (RAW264.7) were co-cultured in 6-well Transwell plates. Semaglutide (60 or 140 n<sc>m</sc>) was administrated for 24 h, while pioglitazone (2 μ<sc>m</sc>) and toyocamycin (200 n<sc>m</sc>) were used as a positive control drug and a XBP1 inhibitor, respectively. Autophagy and apoptosis of AML12 cells were detected by transmission electron microscopy and Western blotting (WB). Hepatocyte steatosis was evaluated by adopting total intracellular triglyceride determination, analysis of the relative expression of proteins and genes associated with lipid metabolism and hepatocyte Oil red O staining. Detection of inflammation factors was conducted by ELISA and WB. To explore the underlying mechanism of NAFLD treatment with semaglutide, the relative expression of related proteins and genes were tested. Our study demonstrated that semaglutide treatment improved autophagy and inhibited apoptosis of hepatocytes, while notably ameliorating steatosis of hepatocytes. In addition, inflammation was attenuated in the NAFLD cell co-culture model after semaglutide administration. Semaglutide also significantly reduced the protein and gene expression levels of the IRE1α-XBP1-C/EBPα signaling pathway in macrophages. Semaglutide partially ameliorated NAFLD by downregulating the IRE1α-XBP1-C/EBPα signaling pathway in macrophages. These findings may provide a potential theoretical basis for semaglutide therapy for NAFLD.",2025,01,Pharmacology,Qin Hu; Li Zhang; YiTing Tao; ShuangLin Xie; AiYun Wang; Caiying Luo; RenHua Yang; Zhiqiang Shen; Bo He; Yu Fang; Peng Chen,2216,True,2025-01-01
39848507,Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease and the cardiovascular system.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously termed nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease, is an important and rising health issue with a link with atherosclerotic cardiovascular (CV) disease (CVD), affecting ∼25-30 % of the adults in the general population; in patients with diabetes, its prevalence culminates to ∼70 %; its evolutive form, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, is estimated to be the main cause of liver transplantation in the future. MASLD is a multisystem disease that affects, besides the liver, extra-hepatic organs and regulatory pathways; it raises the risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D), CVD, and chronic kidney disease; the disease may also progress to hepatocellular carcinoma. Its diagnosis requires hepatic steatosis and at least one cardiometabolic risk factor and the exclusion of both significant alcohol consumption and other competing causes of chronic liver disease. Beyond CV events, associated metabolic comorbidities comprise obesity (∼50 %), T2D (∼20 %), hyperlipidemia (∼70 %), hypertension (∼40 %), and metabolic syndrome (∼40 %). Among the various clinical events, CV events mostly determine prognosis as they are the leading cause of death in these patients. Regarding management, statins exert beneficial effects in improving liver injury; silybin, derived from Silybum marianum, has some protective effects; lifestyle modification, such as weight loss, dietary changes, physical exercise, and abstention from alcohol use combined with optimal management of comorbidities are most helpful. Bariatric surgery may be an option in persons with MASLD and obesity. Adults with non-cirrhotic MASLD and significant liver fibrosis may be candidates for targeted treatment with resmetirom, which has histological efficacy on steatohepatitis and fibrosis with an acceptable safety and tolerability profile, whereas, no MASLD-targeted pharmacotherapy can be beneficial in the cirrhotic stage, whereby other measures may include metabolic drugs, nutritional counseling, surveillance for portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma, and finally, liver transplantation in decompensated cirrhosis.",2025,May,Trends in cardiovascular medicine,Antonis A Manolis; Theodora A Manolis; Apostolos Vouliotis; Antonis S Manolis,2156,True,2025-05-01

The present review covers this difficult process, finally providing a drug to complement lifestyle intervention, that has long been the sole approved therapeutic intervention. However, the availability of a drug shown to reduce disease progression in advanced stages of diseases opens a series of questions that deserve even more intense research. How to continue ongoing trials? How to generate an appropriate use of resmetirom in the community, limiting treatment according to predefined criteria and according to individual risk assessment?

41105669,Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) can be a possible predictive factor of incident CKD: NAGALA cohort study.,"A decade-long follow-up study identified metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) as an independent predictor for the onset of chronic kidney disease (CKD). In 2023, a Delphi consensus introduced the term metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) as an updated nomenclature. This study aims to evaluate whether MASLD, as the newly defined concept of steatotic liver disease, functions as an independent risk factor for CKD development. Additionally, the study seeks to examine the association between MASLD and CKD, while identifying contributing risk factors. This research involved a retrospective cohort study conducted on individuals participating in health checkups at Asahi University Hospital, Japan, from 1994 to 2023. Logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate the relationship between MASLD and the incidence of CKD over a five-year follow-up period. A total of 15,873 participants were included in this study. The incidence of CKD was highest among individuals with MASLD (9.5%). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that MASLD was significantly associated with an increased risk of CKD, with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.37 (95% CI 1.12-1.67, p = 0.002). Additional factors such as age (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.03-1.05, p < 0.001) and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) (OR 0.88, 95% CI 0.87-0.89, p < 0.001) were also identified as significant predictors of CKD. These findings suggest a robust association between MASLD and an elevated risk of CKD compared to individuals without steatotic liver disease or cardiometabolic risk factors. This study establishes MASLD as a significant risk factor for CKD onset. Effective identification and management of MASLD cases are essential to mitigate the incidence of CKD.",2025,01,PloS one,Yuriko Ono; Kimiko Sakai; Takuro Okamura; Hiroshi Okada; Akihiro Obora; Takao Kojima; Masahide Hamaguchi; Michiaki Fukui,1780,True,2025-01-01
41055146,Green tea prepared ,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is closely linked to metabolic disorders and is characterized by excess fat accumulation in the liver. Although drinking green tea has been reported to have various health benefits, the impacts and mechanisms of green tea prepared by the daily infusion method on preventing NAFLD progression remain unclear. To address this issue, we first established a human diet-mimicking mouse model induced by a high-fat, high-cholesterol, high-refined sugar Western diet (WD). Then, we supplemented green tea extract (GTE) prepared with the traditional daily infusion method at 0.5% or 1% to investigate its preventive effect on NAFLD. Results revealed that GTE consumption alleviated the serum levels of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as well as the hepatic level of triglyceride (TG) induced by the WD.

Forty-two male Sprague-Dawley rats, excluding controls, were divided into 7 groups after receiving a standard radius defect. The serum levels of total protein (TP), calcium (Ca Changes in the selected serum markers were observed in the blood samples obtained from the specimens; however, these changes may not have been due to EXE administration. No significant negative effect on bone healing was observed in the groups that received subcutaneous EXE after the bone defect was created. By contrast, it was observed that for the treatment group that received EXE for 7 consecutive days before the bone defect was created on Day 7, bone healing progressed more slowly than in the groups treated with saline. Regarding the binding of EXE to the other target receptors, root mean square deviation (RMSD) values were low, bruised surface area (BSA) was high, and electrostatic interactions were strong, indicating that the ligand (i.e., EXE) binds to the selected receptor surfaces. Although the data obtained from the in vitro analyses in this study were verified using molecular docking, it should be noted that its design is preclinical. Given the widespread clinical use of GLP-1 receptor agonists in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), our research findings may have translational relevance.

Prospective observational study using magnetic resonance imaging with proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) to determine the presence of maternal and offspring liver steatosis during gestation (3rd trimester) and in the first year postpartum. Women were deemed at high or low risk for MASLD if they had risk factors (pre-pregnancy obesity or MASLD, gestational diabetes, rapid weight gain during pregnancy). Multivariable regression and longitudinal mixed models assessed associations and changes in MRI-derived fat measures. We recruited 57 pregnant women; 47 (82 %) were high-risk for MASLD. MASLD was seen in 18 % (n = 10) of women (and 15 % [n = 7/47] of those high-risk), with a median PDFF of 5.9 % (IQR: 5.6-12.0 %). Maternal weight, BMI and HDL-C differed between groups. The fetal liver and placental PDFF of offspring of women with and without MASLD were not different. N = 7 (12 %) infants had clinically significant steatosis in utero, all offspring of mothers without gestational MASLD. Of the 30 mothers with repeat liver MRI-PDFF at 9 months postpartum, ten (33 %)had MASLD.

With the advent of multiple therapeutic targets in late-phase clinical drug development for MASH, there is a knowledge gap to better understand the comparative efficacy of various pharmacological agents. We conducted an updated network meta-analysis to evaluate the relative rank order of the different pharmacological agents for both fibrosis regression and MASH resolution. We searched PubMed and Embase databases from January 1, 2020 to December 1, 2024, for published randomized controlled trials comparing pharmacological interventions in patients with biopsy-proven MASH. The co-primary endpoints were fibrosis improvement ≥1 stage without MASH worsening and MASH resolution without worsening fibrosis. We conducted surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA) analysis. A total of 29 randomized controlled trials (n=9324) were included. Pegozafermin, cilofexor + firsocostat, denifanstat, survodutide, obeticholic acid, tirzepatide, resmetirom, and semaglutide were significantly better than placebo in achieving fibrosis regression without worsening MASH.

41047964,Healthcare costs and treatment patterns associated with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist use among patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.,"What is this article about? Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is a liver disease that gets worse over time. MASH can lead to serious complications such as liver failure. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are used to treat obesity and Type 2 diabetes, which are common among people with MASH. This article is about the usage of GLP-1 RAs among people diagnosed with MASH. We looked at patient characteristics, BMI, patterns of medication treatment, reasons for discontinuation and changes in healthcare use and costs after starting GLP-1 RA. We also captured similar data for people who started a different Type 2 diabetes treatment to provide additional context. What were the results? People with MASH who took GLP-1 RA tended to lose weight, measured as a decrease in the percentage of patients with a very high BMI (≥40). This was not observed in people who started a different Type 2 diabetes treatment. More than half of people who started GLP-1 RAs stopped treatment for at least 45 days within 1 year. Roughly half of people who stopped treatment did not restart treatment. Side effects were the most common reason for stopping treatment. Total healthcare costs were $27,586, and nonmedicine-related costs were $16,886 in the year after starting treatment. What do the results mean? GLP-1 RA may be effective in promoting weight loss among people with MASH, but these medications may not address other issues among people with MASH as healthcare use and costs remain high.",2025,Nov,Journal of comparative effectiveness research,Elliot B Tapper; Taylor Ryan; Ni Zeng; Renee Carter; Jessamine P Winer-Jones; Machaon Bonafede; Yestle Kim,1522,True,2025-11-01

This study aimed to assess existing models of care, clinical infrastructure, policy frameworks, and provider perspectives across 17 MENA countries. A cross-sectional, mixed-methods survey was distributed to clinicians from MASLD-related specialties across the region. A total of 130 experts (87.2% response rate) from academic, public, and private sectors in 17 countries participated. The questionnaire addressed national policies, diagnostic and therapeutic practices, referral pathways, multidisciplinary team (MDT) integration, and patient/public engagement. Quantitative responses were analyzed descriptively, while qualitative inputs underwent thematic analysis. Only 35.4% of respondents confirmed the presence of national clinical guidelines for MASLD, and 73.1% reported the absence of a national strategy. Structured referral pathways were reported by 39.2% of participants, and only 31.5% believed the current model adequately addresses MASLD. While 60% supported MDT approaches, implementation remained inconsistent. Limited access to transient elastography was reported by 26.2% of providers. Public education efforts were minimal: 22.3% reported no available tools, and 87.7% indicated the absence of patient-reported outcomes data. Nearly half (47.7%) cited poor patient adherence, attributed to low awareness, financial barriers, and lack of follow-up. Significant policy, structural, and educational gaps persist in MASLD care across the MENA region.

40998556,One Year of Exercise After Weight Loss Increases Postprandial GLP-1 Secretion in Contrast to Usual Activity or GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Treatment.,"Incretin-based obesity medication maintains weight loss by mimicking the appetite-inhibiting hormone GLP-1. Interestingly, chronic exercise may improve postprandial appetite control by increasing late postprandial secretion of endogenous GLP-1. Therefore, we investigated whether an exercise program after weight loss could increase late-phase postprandial GLP-1 secretion. This study is an exploratory analysis of adults with obesity (n = 195) who lost 13.1 kg on a low-calorie diet and were randomized to 52 weeks of either usual activity, moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise, the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide (3.0 mg/day), or the combination. The primary endpoint was change in late-phase GLP-1 response to a 3-h liquid mixed meal test before and after diet-induced weight loss and after 1 year of intervention. Diet-induced weight loss did not change late-phase GLP-1 response (3%; 95% CI, -4%-10%). One year of exercise increased late-phase postprandial GLP-1 response within the group by 37% (95% CI, 20%-57%), and this increase was 25% greater (95% CI, 3%-51%, p = 0.02) compared to the usual activity group. Late-phase postprandial GLP-1 response was unchanged in both groups treated with GLP-1 receptor agonist compared to placebo. One year of exercise increased late-phase postprandial GLP-1 response, which may prevent increased appetite after weight loss and thereby weight regain.

PDAC-DM is often clinically confused with type 2 diabetes, resulting in delayed cancer detection and poorly individualised hyperglycaemia treatment. We investigated whether these forms of diabetes can be distinguished at the metabolic level. Adults with either cancer treatment-naive PDAC-DM (n=28) or type 2 diabetes (n=97), and with diabetes onset within 3 years, underwent mixed-meal tolerance tests to investigate glucose metabolism. Outcomes included insulin sensitivity (Matsuda index), insulin secretion (insulinogenic index), beta cell function (oral disposition index), insulin clearance, and postprandial glucagon, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) responses. Compared with type 2 diabetes, individuals with PDAC-DM showed ~2.5-fold greater insulin sensitivity, ~81% lower insulin secretion and ~40% lower beta cell function. Insulin clearance was higher in the PDAC-DM group than the type 2 diabetes group, with and without adjustment for insulin sensitivity. Glucagon and GLP-1 levels increased after a meal in both groups, but levels were higher in the PDAC-DM group. GIP levels were similar between groups. The metabolic differences between groups persisted after adjustment for age, sex and BMI. PDAC-DM and type 2 diabetes are metabolically distinct, with different defects responsible for hyperglycaemia. PDAC-DM is characterised predominantly by insulin deficiency and displays higher insulin sensitivity than type 2 diabetes. There are also differences in alpha cell regulation and insulin clearance compared with type 2 diabetes. These findings identify biological characteristics that may have implications for individualised treatment of PDAC-DM and guide diagnostic biomarker discovery for early PDAC diagnosis.",2025,Sep,Diabetologia,Frederico G S Toledo; Yisheng Li; Fuchenchu Wang; Melena D Bellin; Randall Brand; Kenneth Cusi; William Fisher; Yogish C Kudva; Walter G Park; Zeb I Saeed; Dhiraj Yadav; Robert V Considine; Sarah C Graham; Dana K Andersen; Jose Serrano; Mark O Goodarzi; Phil A Hart,1924,True,2025-09-01

Although multiple risk factors for anastomotic leakage have been identified, predicting the incidence of anastomotic leakage remains difficult. To develop a machine learning predictive model that combines logits from different base models to predict the incidence of anastomotic leakage more accurately. This retrospective prognostic study was conducted across 13 centers in Europe and North America between January 1, 2012, and December 31, 2020, and with data from the European Society of Coloproctology (ESCP). The study population included patients 18 years or older who underwent colon resection with anastomosis and had a follow-up of at least 6 months. Patients with metastatic disease and insufficient follow-up were excluded. A total of 6079 patients from 13 centers across different countries were included in the analysis with an additional 3041 patients from the ESCP. Data analysis was conducted from October 2024 to January 2025. Colon anastomosis for various reasons, including neoplasia, diverticulitis, ischemia, iatrogenic or traumatic perforation, or inflammatory bowel disease.

We previously demonstrated that PWH with lipohypertrophy had a decrease in weight, visceral adipose tissue, and several inflammatory markers after semaglutide, a Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist. This study aims to investigate the effect of semaglutide on cognitive function in PWH and the possible mediation of this effect by changes in adiposity or inflammation. In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 2b clinical trial, PWH on antiretroviral therapy, were randomized 1:1 to receive 32 weeks of subcutaneous semaglutide or placebo. The primary outcome was the change in cognitive function at 32 weeks. Secondary measures included changes in body composition, and levels of inflammatory markers. Causal mediation analysis assessed semaglutide's direct and indirect effects on Cognivue scores through changes in adiposity and inflammation. 108 participants were included (54 per arm); 65% non-white, 40% female, and median age of 53 years. Compared to placebo, PWH on semaglutide significantly increased visuospatial, naming/language, and delayed recall scores at 32 weeks (p = 0.01, 0.05, and 0.04, respectively). After adjusting for sex and absolute CD4 count, only the visuospatial score remained statistically significant (p=0.05).

41130202,The enedioic acid analog 326E alleviates metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis via dual targeting at ACLY and PPARα.,"The rise in the prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is attributed significantly to dysregulated lipid metabolism. This study discovered that the enedioic acid ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) inhibitor 326E, an investigational new drug in a phase 2a study for hypercholesterolemia, markedly reduces hepatic lipid accumulation and alleviates MASH in mouse models of MASH. Mechanistic studies demonstrated that 326E exerts these effects not only by inhibiting ACLY to reduce de novo lipogenesis (DNL) but also as a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor α (PPARα) allosteric regulator to increase hepatic fatty acid oxidation (FAO). The efficacy of activated PPARα for MASH is enhanced by suppressed recycling of FAO products to lipid accumulation as a result of ACLY inhibition. Subsequent studies in cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) confirmed the effectiveness of 326E for MASH in primate species. In a randomized phase 1b/2a clinical trial in patients with MASH (NCT06491576), 326E was well tolerated and reduced circulating gamma-glutamyl transferase (γ-GGT).

In clinical trials, semaglutide improved glycemic control and obesity, and reduced major cardiovascular events. However, the reports are limited on its real-world efficacy relating to various metabolic factors such as dyslipidemia or metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) in Asian patients with T2D. In our retrospective longitudinal study, we selected patients with T2D who were given once-weekly semaglutide and compared metabolic parameters before and after the start of semaglutide. Seventy-five patients were eligible. HbA1c decreased significantly, by 0.7-0.9%, and body weight by 1.4-1.7 kg during the semaglutide treatment. Non-HDL cholesterol decreased significantly at 3, 6 and 12 months after the initiation of semaglutide; LDL cholesterol decreased at 3 and 6 months; and HDL cholesterol increased at 12 months. The effects on body weight, HbA1c and lipid profile were pronounced in patients who were given semaglutide as a first GLP-1RA (GLP-1R naïve), whereas improvements in HbA1c were also observed in patients who were given semaglutide after being switched from other GLP-1RAs. During a 12-month semaglutide treatment, the hepatic steatosis index (HSI) tended to decrease. Moreover, a significant decrease in the AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI) was observed in GLP-1RA naïve patients. Our real-world study confirmed the beneficial effects of once-weekly semaglutide, namely, improved body weight, glycemic control and atherogenic lipid profile. The beneficial effects on MASLD were also suggested.",2024,May,Biomedicines,Hisayuki Katsuyama; Mariko Hakoshima; Emika Kaji; Masaaki Mino; Eiji Kakazu; Sakura Iida; Hiroki Adachi; Tatsuya Kanto; Hidekatsu Yanai,1687,True,2024-05-01
40221023,Multidisciplinary clinical practice guideline on the management of metabolic hepatic steatosis.,"Metabolic hepatic steatosis (MetHS) is a clinically heterogeneous, multisystemic, dynamic, and complex disease, whose progression is one of the main causes of cirrhosis and hepatocarcinoma. This clinical practice guideline aims to respond to its main challenges, both in terms of disease burden and complexity. To this end, recommendations have been proposed to experts through the Delphi method. The consensus was optimal in recommendations regarding type 2 diabetes as a risk factor (1.5.1, 4.5.1), in which cases early detection of MetHS should be carried out (4.5.2). Its results also emphasize the importance of the use of non-invasive tests (FIB-4, NFS, HFS) for the exclusion of significant fibrosis in patients with suspected MetHS (2.3.1, 2.3.3). Diagnosis should be carried out through the sequential combination of non-invasive indices and transient elastography by FibroScan® for its risk stratification (2.3.3). A nearly unanimous consensus was reached regarding the role of early prevention in the impact on the quality of life and survival of patients (5.1.2), as well as on the effectiveness of the Mediterranean diet and physical exercise in relation to the improvement of steatosis, steatohepatitis and fibrosis in MetHS patients (5.2.2) and on the positive results offered by resmiterom and semaglutide in promoting fibrosis regression (5.4.1). Finally, a great consensus has been reached regarding the importance of multidisciplinary management in MetHS, for which it is essential to agree on multidisciplinary protocols for referral between levels in each health area (6.2.1), as well as ensuring that referrals to Hepatology/Digestive and Endocrinology or Internal Medicine services are effective and beneficial to prevent the risk of disease progression (6.2.3, 6.3.1).",2025,Oct,Gastroenterologia y hepatologia,Manuel Romero-Gómez; Javier Escalada; Mar Noguerol; Antonio Pérez; Juana Carretero; Javier Crespo; Juan J Mascort; Ignacio Aguilar; Francisco Tinahones; Pedro Cañones; Ricardo Gómez-Huelgas; Daniel de Luis; Idoia Genúa Trullos; Rocío Aller; Miguel A Rubio,1793,True,2025-10-01
41088267,Linear association between the composite dietary antioxidant index and the prevalence of sarcopenia in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"A new way to measure the capability of food to inhibit oxidation is the “composite dietary antioxidant index” (CDAI), which helps determine whether sarcopenia progresses because of oxidative stress. Using “National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey” (NHANES) data from 2001 to 2018, this study aimed to explore whether a relationship exists between the CDAI and the development of sarcopenia among individuals who have been confirmed to have “metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease” (MASLD). The present work functioned as a countrywide representative demographic-based transverse analysis, which included eligible adult MASLD participants from NHANES 2001–2018 and omitted individuals with incomplete data on the CDAI, sarcopenia, and covariates. Multifactorial logistical regression evaluations, constrained cubic spline evaluations, categorized evaluations, and robustness assessments were employed to thoroughly investigate the relationship between the CDAI and sarcopenia in MASLD patients. The analysis included a total of 5574 participants who were confirmed to have MASLD. According to the comprehensively adjusted model, the occurrence of sarcopenia among people with MASLD was significantly inversely related to the CDAI (odds ratio 0.946, 95% confidence interval 0.922–0.972,  Adherence to CDAI-assessed antioxidant dietary patterns may help prevent sarcopenia in the MASLD population.

Their widespread global use has been accompanied by an additional observation related to a potential reduction in alcohol consumption. Preclinical studies in animal models, along with preliminary clinical findings, suggest that GLP-1 RAs may exert beneficial effects on alcohol use disorder (AUD). The latter represents a significant public health challenge, contributing to a broad spectrum of health, social, and economic burdens. Concurrently, the use of GLP-1 RAs in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has been associated with a clinically meaningful reduction in all-cause mortality, major cardiovascular events, and progression to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). In this current opinion article, we firstly summarize the current literature dealing with the effect of GLP-1 RAs on AUD based on findings from experimental and human clinical studies. Additionally, beyond their role in MASLD, we explore in detail the potential impact of GLP-1 RAs on patients with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and metabolic and alcohol-related/associated liver disease (MetALD). Finally, we highlight current challenges and unresolved issues, including concerns related to safety, accessibility, cost, and limitations in the clinical application of GLP-1 RAs.",2025,Jun,Biomedicines,Lampros Chrysavgis; Niki-Gerasimoula Mourelatou; Evangelos Cholongitas,1526,True,2025-06-01

Although recent evidence points to a potential association between these two conditions, the underlying molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. This study aims to elucidate their shared molecular landscape using integrated bioinformatics approaches. Three IVDD and two NAFLD datasets were acquired from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We performed differential expression analysis (DEGs), weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and machine learning to identify shared hub genes. The diagnostic relevance of these genes was further assessed using ROC curves and nomograms. Single-cell sequencing analysis was employed to examine gene expression patterns across cell clusters in intervertebral disk and liver tissues.  Six shared genes were identified between IVDD and NAFLD. Among these, ME1, HAS2, and ADRB2 were highlighted as potential biomarkers. Validation confirmed consistent expression patterns and strong predictive performance for both diseases. KEGG pathway and immune infiltration analyses indicated significant involvement of these biomarkers in disease-related pathways and immune cell interactions. Single-cell sequencing revealed distinct expression profiles and functional roles of ME1, HAS2, and ADRB2 across relevant cell types.  This study identifies ME1, HAS2, and ADRB2 as pivotal shared biomarkers for IVDD and NAFLD, providing new insights into their molecular interconnection. The findings enhance our understanding of the comorbid mechanisms and highlight the potential of exercise as a therapeutic strategy for both conditions.

However, their benefits following major ischemic events are unclear. Herein, we present real-world analysis assessing outcomes of GLP-1A following major ischemic event. This retrospective cohort study utilized the TriNetX platform. Adults (≥ 18 years) with AIS treated with intravenous thrombolysis (IVT) were identified; exposure was any US FDA-approved GLP-1A initiated within 6 months of the index stroke. The comparator was IVT-treated patients without GLP-1A exposure. Outcomes assessed at 5 years included major adverse health-care events (MAHEs): number of emergency department (ED) visits and inpatient hospitalizations, and all-cause mortality. One-to-one propensity score matching balanced baseline characteristics. We estimated risk difference/risk ratio/odds ratio, 5-year Kaplan-Meier (KM) event probabilities with log-rank tests, and Cox hazard ratios (HRs) with 95% CIs; small cells (≤ 10) were masked per data-use agreement. Of 69,005 eligible patients, 549 received GLP-1A and 68,938 did not; after matching, 432 per group were analyzed. GLP-1A exposure was associated with lower all-cause mortality (7.4% vs 14.1%; HR 0.61, 95% CI 0.39-0.93), lower ED visits (37% vs 47%; HR 0.78, 95% CI 0.63-0.95), and lower inpatient hospitalizations (31.9% vs 45.4%; HR 0.69, 95% CI 0.55-0.85); KM log-rank p ≤ 0.05 for all. Median time to first MAHE was longer with GLP-1A (1293 vs 897 days for hospitalization and 886 vs 603 days for ED visits).

41108032,Relationship between MASLD and women's health: A review.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD; formerly non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, NAFLD) is a common chronic liver disease strongly linked to obesity, metabolic syndrome (MetS), and type 2 diabetes. It starts as benign hepatic steatosis, but may progress to severe fibrosis, cirrhosis, or hepatocellular carcinoma. Today, MASLD represents one of the leading indications for liver transplantation. This review summarizes current knowledge on MASLD, including its pathogenesis, management strategies, regional disparities, and its specific relevance to women's health. The influence of sex hormones on MASLD has been documented. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and the menopause increase MASLD prevalence by more than twofold. Moreover, PCOS increases the risk and severity of MASLD, independent of BMI. The role of menopausal hormone replacement therapy in MASLD remains controversial. However, transdermal estrogen and micronized progesterone or dydrogesterone seem to be more appropriate options. In pregnancy, MASLD is associated with >3-fold increased risk of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. It may also increase the risk of MASLD development in the offspring-an effect that appears to be mitigated by breastfeeding for longer than six months. Given these findings, it is essential that clinicians involved in women's healthcare are aware of MASLD and its implications across the female lifespan.",2025,01,"Women's health (London, England)",Pavlina Jancova; Khaled Ismail; Lucie Vistejnova,1435,True,2025-01-01

41054018,Addressing unmet needs for chronic kidney disease treatment in type 1 diabetes: A review.,"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a serious complication occurring in nearly one of three people with type 1 diabetes (T1D). Major therapeutic advances have been made in the management of CKD for people with type 2 diabetes (T2D), thereby improving their kidney, cardiovascular, and survival outcomes. However, people with T1D were largely excluded from these CKD therapeutic development programmes. Recent treatment advancements for people with T2D include the introduction of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors, a nonsteroidal mineralocorticoid antagonist, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists. The development and progression of CKD in people with T1D are driven by a constellation of risk factors such as hyperglycemia, hypertension, obesity, and others that share common mechanistic links with T2D. As such, a compelling rationale exists for focused studies of these therapeutic classes for the treatment of CKD in T1D. Additionally, care provided by a coordinated team of primary care clinicians, endocrinologists, nephrologists, and cardiologists is central to therapeutic implementation. There is a major unmet need for improved treatments for CKD in people with T1D. Ongoing and future studies will help to establish whether proven therapies for CKD in T2D are also safe and efficacious in people with T1D.

This retrospective observational study analyzed data from 1009 patients across 38 endocrinology units from Türkiye. Patients with a history of bariatric surgery, those who started orlistat concurrently with liraglutide, and one patient who developed pancreatitis on the 15th day of treatment were excluded from the analyses of weight and laboratory changes. At least one side effect was observed in 48% of the patients, with nausea and vomiting being the most common. The most frequent reason for discontinuing treatment was the cost of the medication (42.6%). The median duration of liraglutide use was 4 months (IQR; 3-6), and the median dose was 2.4 mg (IQR; 1.8-3). Among the entire cohort, 76.4% and 40.9% of patients achieved a 5% and 10% weight loss target, respectively. Significant reductions were observed in metabolic parameters during the treatment. The treatment duration was identified as an independent predictor for achieving 5% and 10% weight loss targets (B = 0.315, p < 0.001) and 10% weight loss (B = 0.216, p < 0.001). Liraglutide effectively results in clinically significant weight loss, achieves expected weight loss targets, and improves metabolic parameters in real-world clinical practice.

41083056,Immunomodulation in post-transplant diabetes mellitus: Challenges and management.,"Solid organ transplantation (SOT) in diabetic patients presents unique challenges in balancing immunosuppression, glycemic control, and the risk of infection. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) affects 10 %-40 % of transplant recipients, with immunosuppressive therapies such as corticosteroids and calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) contributing to insulin resistance and impaired beta-cell function. This review critically examines immunomodulation strategies in diabetic SOT recipients, focusing on optimizing immunosuppressive therapy while mitigating hyperglycemia-related complications. Early glycemic control through insulin therapy, followed by a transition to oral hypoglycemic agents such as metformin, GLP-1 receptor agonists, and DPP-4 inhibitors, has proven effective in reducing PTDM and enhancing long-term transplant outcomes. Alternative immunosuppressive strategies, including belatacept-based regimens and switching from tacrolimus to cyclosporine, offer promising methods to lower PTDM incidence while preserving graft survival. Personalized immunosuppressive regimens tailored to an individual's metabolic risks further improve patient outcomes. Emerging strategies, such as monoclonal antibodies, mesenchymal stem cell therapy, and localized immunomodulation, hold promise for enhancing immune balance while mitigating metabolic complications. A multidisciplinary team involving endocrinologists, transplant surgeons, and diabetes specialists is essential for comprehensive management. Additionally, routine screening for new-onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) and early interventions are vital to prevent long-term complications. Despite advancements, gaps remain regarding the long-term metabolic effects of immunosuppressive agents, the optimal timing for transitioning from insulin to oral therapy, and the role of new immunomodulatory treatments.

Resmetirom, a selective thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist has been developed as a therapeutic modality for MASLD. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of resmetirom compared to a placebo in the treatment of MASLD. Eligible studies were systematically identified by screening PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Cochrane library, Embase, and ClinicalTrials.gov from 2014 to 2024. Only randomized controlled trials comparing the efficacy and safety of resmetirom in the treatment of MASLD against placebo were included in the analysis. Meta-analysis was performed using RevMan 5.4 software. Four studies with low risk of bias and involving a total of 2359 participants were identified. The metanalysis included only three clinical trials with 2234 participants. A significant reduction in MRI-proton density fat fraction (MRI-PDFF) with 80 mg Resmetirom compared to that with placebo [SMD - 27.74 (95% CI - 32.05 to - 32.42), p < 0.00001] at 36-52 weeks as well as at 12-16 weeks [SMD - 30.92 (95% CI - 36.44 to - 25.40), p < 0.00001]. With Resmetirom 100 mg dose at 36-52 weeks [SMD - 36.05 (95% CI - 40.67 to - 31.43), p < 0.00001] and 12-16 weeks [SMD - 36.89 (95% CI - 40.73 to - 33.05), p < 0.00001] were observed. Resmetirom treatment was associated with a significant reduction in LDL-c triglyceride, lipoproteins. and liver enzymes. There was significant reduction FT4 and increase in SHBG and sex steroids with Resmetirom compared to placebo. There was no major difference in the overall treatment emergent adverse events at 80 mg [OR 1.55 (95% CI 0.84 to 2.87), and 100 mg [OR 1.13 (95% CI 0.78 to 1.63), doses of Resmetirom compared to placebo. However, gastrointestinal adverse events diarrhoea and nausea occurred in ≥ 10% in the Resmetirom group compared to placebo at < 12 week. Resmetirom treatment showed modest efficacy in treating MASLD with reduction in MRI-PDFF, LDL-c, triglyceride, lipoproteins, liver enzymes and NASH biomarkers without significant safety concerns.

41103259,Association of aspirin use alone with mortality and liver-related events in MASLD: a multi-institutional three-year study.,"The global prevalence of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), previously known as NAFLD, is increasing. While daily aspirin use has been associated with reduced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) risk in NAFLD, its impact on mortality and liver-related outcomes in MASLD remains unclear. This retrospective, multi-institutional cohort study included 48,722 MASLD patients from 2008 to 2020, divided into aspirin users and non-users. Exclusion criteria included significant cardiac disease unrelated to aspirin, alcoholic liver disease, incomplete follow-up, and concomitant use of other antiplatelet therapies. Propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to balance baseline characteristics, including demographics, cirrhosis status, ALT levels, cardiovascular conditions, and concurrent medications. After PSM, 2003 patients were included in each cohort. Aspirin users had a mean duration of use of 4.59 ± 3.97 years, with 97% on a daily dose of 75-100 mg. Over three years, aspirin use was not significantly associated with reductions in overall mortality, liver-related events, liver-related mortality, or HCC incidence compared to non-users. However, a trend toward lower liver-related mortality and HCC incidence was observed without an increased risk of major bleeding. In this large cohort, daily aspirin use alone did not significantly reduce mortality or liver-related events in MASLD patients over three years. The observed trends may suggest potential long-term benefits, warranting further investigation into extended aspirin duration and combination strategies for MASLD management.",2025,Dec,Annals of medicine,Chien-Hao Huang; Chun-Li Wang; Victor Chien-Chia Wu; Yi-Chung Hsieh; Chia-Ling Wu; Z-Fan Zeng; Yu-Tung Huang; Chao-Wei Hsu; Rong-Nan Chien; Shang-Hung Chang,1623,True,2025-12-01

36951144,Weight loss breaks the bond between nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular diseases: A clinical and epidemiological perspective.,"Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a growing health concern that is closely related to obesity and metabolic syndrome. In particular, NAFLD has been increasingly reported in adolescents and young adults in recent years. Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) such as cardiac remodeling, heart failure, myocardial infarction, valvular heart diseases, and arrhythmia are more common in patients with NAFLD. CVD are the major cause of mortality in NAFLD. Although NAFLD often affects patients with obesity/overweight, it can also affect subjects with normal body mass index (BMI), known as lean NAFLD, which has a strong correlation with CVD. Obesity imposes a considerably increased risk of NAFLD and CVD. Consistently, weight-lowering approaches that can pronouncedly decrease body weight and maintain it in the long term, such as bariatric surgery and treatment with semaglutide and tirzepatide, have been promising in alleviating both CVD and NAFLD. Interestingly, compared with patients with NAFLD and obesity, a minimal amount of weight loss resolves NAFLD in lean patients. Besides the widespread use of bariatric surgery, the development of new GLP-1 agonists and GLP-1 GIP agonists revolutionized the treatment of obesity in recent years. Here, we discuss the interwoven correlation between obesity, NAFLD, and CVD and the benefits of weight-lowering approaches.",2023,Jun,Obesity reviews : an official journal of the International Association for the Study of Obesity,Moein Ala; Seyed Parsa Eftekhar,1370,True,2023-06-01
41007144,A Bivalent Protease-Activated Receptor-Derived Peptide Mimics Neuronal Anti-Apoptotic Activity of Activated Protein C.,"Activated protein C (APC) exerts anticoagulant and cytoprotective cell signaling activities. APC's cell signaling requires protease-activated receptor (PAR) PAR1 and PAR3, and APC's PAR cleavages generate peptides capable of agonizing biased G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) cytoprotective signaling, resulting in anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities and endothelial barrier stabilization. The PAR-sequence-derived 34-residue ""G10 peptide"" comprising PAR1 residues 47-55 covalently attached by a 10-glycine linker to PAR3 residues 51-65 is an orthosteric/allosteric bivalent GPCR agonist that potently mimics APC's anti-inflammatory activity and endothelial barrier stabilization activity. The objective of this study was to determine whether the G10 peptide mimics APC's anti-apoptotic activity using cultured murine neurons challenged by N-methyl-d-aspartate that provokes neuronal apoptosis. In these new studies, the G10 peptide mimicked APC's anti-apoptotic activity. Thus, the PAR-derived 34-residue G10 peptide mimics APC's three major cytoprotective activities, namely anti-inflammatory and anti-apoptotic activities and endothelial barrier stabilization. Peptides that agonize GPCRs provide promising and currently approved drugs; e.g., semaglutide and tirzepatide that contain 31 and 39 amino acid residues, respectively. Thus, this new study adds to the rationale for pursuing further studies of the G10 peptide for potential therapeutic value for multiple pathologies where APC or signaling-selective APC variants are therapeutic in preclinical animal studies.",2025,Aug,"Bioengineering (Basel, Switzerland)",Abhay Sagare; Youbin Kim; Kassandra Kisler; Ruslan Rust; William J Mack; José A Fernández; Berislav V Zlokovic; John H Griffin,1585,True,2025-08-01
41098801,Steatotic liver disease and cancer: from pathogenesis to therapeutic targets.,"As environmental exposomes are changing with time, so are liver diseases around the globe. Due to an increasing prevalence of overnutrition and sedentary lifestyle in the global population, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and steatohepatitis have been increasing steadily in the past decades. Alcohol consumption is another common risk factor for liver diseases such as alcohol-associated liver disease or hepatitis. For both alcohol-associated and metabolic dysfunction-associated liver diseases, hepatocyte injuries are among the early events during the development of steatotic liver disease (SLD). Hepatic inflammation and fibrosis ensue with recurring hepatic damages owing to immune responses from multiple immune cell types, particularly neutrophils, Kupffer cells and monocyte-derived macrophages in response to damage-associated and pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and extracellular matrix production predominantly from hepatic stellate cells. Both environmental and genetic factors contribute to the SLD pathogenesis. Common environmental risk factors include obesity, type 2 diabetes mellitus, unhealthy diets, sedentary lifestyle and excessive alcohol consumption. Numerous genome-wide association studies have identified multiple genetic variants associated with key traits of SLD, including patatin-like phospholipase domain containing 3 rs738409, transmembrane 6 superfamily member 2 rs58542926, membrane bound O-acyltransferase domain containing 7 rs641738 and hydroxysteroid 17 beta-dehydrogenase 13 rs72613567. Cirrhosis and liver cancer are common late-stage developments of various chronic liver diseases; however, there are pathological differences according to disease aetiologies. Therefore, preventive and therapeutic intervention strategies should align with the underlying causal and modifiable factors. Currently, multiple therapeutics have been developed or approved for treatment of SLD, including thyroid hormone receptor β agonists, glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists and fibroblast growth factor 21 analogues. The concept of this review was motivated and inspired by the Seventh Annual Symposium of Chinese American Liver Society held in San Diego, California, USA on 13-14 November 2024.",2025,01,eGastroenterology,Zhihong Yang; Zhenjie Liu; Wanqing Liu; Xiaocheng Charlie Dong,2269,True,2025-01-01
41090751,Myeloid-Specific STAT3 Deletion Aggravates Liver Fibrosis in Mice Fed a Methionine- and Choline-Deficient Diet via Upregulation of Hepatocyte-Derived Lipocalin-2.,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) in myeloid cells suppresses proinflammatory cytokine production and reduces collagen deposition. However, its role in methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD) diet-fed mice remains unclear. This study investigates the effects of myeloid-specific STAT3 deficiency on hepatic inflammation and fibrosis in MCD diet-fed mice. Myeloid-specific STAT3 knockout (mSTAT3KO) mice were fed the MCD diet for four weeks to induce metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). MCD diet-fed mice displayed MASH-like pathological phenotypes, including hepatic steatosis, inflammation, and fibrosis. Compared with MCD diet-fed WT mice, mSTAT3KO mice fed the MCD diet exhibited reduced hepatic lipid accumulation but increased fibrosis. Notably, mSTAT3KO mice showed elevated hepatic STAT3 and lipocalin-2 (LCN2) protein levels in hepatocytes. Some proinflammatory cytokines were increased by the MCD diet in mSTAT3KO mice, which also exhibited increased hepatocyte apoptosis. Conversely, MCD diet-induced CD36, perilipin-2, acyl-CoA thioesterase 2, and 4-hydroxynonenal proteins were reduced by mSTAT3KO. Myeloid-specific STAT3 deficiency may induce a compensatory STAT3/LCN2 axis in hepatocytes, thereby exacerbating MASH progression.",2025,Sep,Cells,Kyung Eun Kim; Hyun Joo Shin; Hyeong Seok An; Eun Ae Jeong; Yundong Sun; Jiwon Oh; Jiwoo Park; Jaewoong Lee; Seung-Soon Im; Gu Seob Roh,1292,True,2025-09-01

41155642,Adipokines at the Metabolic-Brain Interface: Therapeutic Modulation by Antidiabetic Agents and Natural Compounds in Alzheimer's Disease.,"The parallel global increase in obesity and Alzheimer's disease (AD) underscores an urgent public health challenge, with converging evidence indicating that metabolic dysfunction strongly contributes to neurodegeneration. Obesity is now recognized not only as a systemic metabolic condition but also as a modifiable risk factor for AD, acting through mechanisms such as chronic low-grade inflammation, insulin resistance, and adipose tissue dysfunction. Among the molecular mediators at this interface, adipokines have emerged as pivotal regulators linking metabolic imbalance to cognitive decline. Adipokines are hormone-like proteins secreted by adipose tissue, including adiponectin, leptin, and resistin, that regulate metabolism, inflammation and can influence brain function. Resistin, frequently elevated in obesity, promotes neuroinflammation, disrupts insulin signaling, and accelerates β-amyloid (Aβ) deposition and tau pathology. Conversely, adiponectin enhances insulin sensitivity, suppresses oxidative stress, and supports mitochondrial and endothelial function, thereby exerting neuroprotective actions. The imbalance between resistin and adiponectin may shift the central nervous system toward a pro-inflammatory and metabolically compromised state that predisposes to neurodegeneration. Beyond their mechanistic relevance, adipokines hold translational promise as biomarkers for early risk stratification and therapeutic monitoring. Importantly, natural compounds, including polyphenols, alkaloids, and terpenoids, have shown the capacity to modulate adipokine signaling, restore metabolic homeostasis, and attenuate AD-related pathology in preclinical models. This positions adipokines not only as pathogenic mediators but also as therapeutic targets at the intersection of diabetes, obesity, and dementia. By integrating mechanistic, clinical, and pharmacological evidence, this review emphasizes adipokine signaling as a novel axis for intervention and highlights natural compound-based strategies as emerging therapeutic approaches in obesity-associated AD. Beyond nutraceuticals, antidiabetic agents also modulate adipokines and AD-relevant pathways. GLP-1 receptor agonists, metformin, and thiazolidinediones tend to increase adiponectin and reduce inflammatory tone, while SGLT2 and DPP-4 inhibitors exert systemic anti-inflammatory and hemodynamic benefits with emerging but still limited cognitive evidence. Together, these drug classes offer mechanistically grounded strategies to target the adipokine-inflammation-metabolism axis in obesity-associated AD.",2025,Oct,"Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)",Paulina Ormazabal; Marianela Bastías-Pérez; Nibaldo C Inestrosa; Pedro Cisternas,2584,True,2025-10-01
41025030,Semaglutide-associated drug-induced liver injury: a case report and review of the literature.,"Semaglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1RA) used to manage type 2 diabetes and, since 2021, for weight loss in individuals with obesity or weight-related comorbidities. It works by enhancing insulin secretion, delaying gastric emptying and reducing appetite. Common side effects include hypoglycaemia, gastrointestinal disturbances, nausea, weight loss and cholelithiasis. While some studies have noted an association with acute kidney injury, reports of liver injury are rare. We present a rare case of drug-induced liver injury in a middle-aged female, associated with transient liver failure after semaglutide use. She presented one month after starting the medication with rapidly worsening liver function tests. Investigations, including a non-invasive liver screen, viral studies, ultrasound and CT imaging, revealed no clear cause. A liver biopsy supported the diagnosis of drug-induced liver injury. The patient improved with supportive treatment and withdrawal of semaglutide. This case underscores the importance of clinician awareness given its increasing, and often unregulated, use for weight loss.",2025,Sep,Oxford medical case reports,Ian Kempster; Darren Fernandes; Mohammed S Saeed; Caroline Sharratt; Sara Benfield,1136,True,2025-09-01
39925851,Adverse events of hepatic anti-fibrotic agents in phase 3 and above clinical trials: a descriptive analysis of the WHO-VigiAccess database.,"Liver fibrosis is a pathological condition in response to chronic liver injuries. Currently, there is no Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved pharmacotherapy for liver fibrosis. Advances in understanding hepatic fibrogenesis have led to the development of anti-fibrotic agents, and some of them have shown promise in phase 3 and above clinical trials. However, adverse drug reactions (ADRs) associated with emerging anti-fibrotic agents may hinder their efficacy and clinical applicability. This study assessed ADRs associated with anti-fibrotic agents as reported in the World Health Organization (WHO) VigiAccess database and compared the adverse reaction characteristics of these agents for optimizing therapeutic strategies. A detailed search was conducted on ClinicalTrial.gov to identify phase 3 or 4 clinical trials involving hepatic anti-fibrotic agents. The ADR reports were retrieved from the WHO-VigiAccess database, with data categorized by demographic characteristics, geographic distribution, and System Organ Classes (SOCs). The most frequently reported ADRs were identified through descriptive analysis. Disproportionality analysis, measured by reporting odd ratio (ROR) and proportional reporting ratio (PRR), was performed to evaluate ADRs related to gastrointestinal disorders. Five hepatic anti-fibrotic agents (empagliflozin, liraglutide, candesartan, obeticholic acid, and resmetirom) were identified. A total of 130,567 ADR reports were analyzed, with empagliflozin, liraglutide, and candesartan showing significantly higher ADRs. The most frequently reported SOCs included gastrointestinal disorders (29.44%), general disorders (24.12%), and nervous system disorders (14.42%). Liraglutide demonstrated a higher risk of gastrointestinal ADRs (ROR: 4.629, 95% CI: 4.517-4.744; PRR: 3.566, 95% CI: 3.492-3.642) compared to the other agents. Severe ADRs were reported in empagliflozin, such as ketoacidosis and infections, while liraglutide was associated with pancreatitis and candesartan with acute kidney injury. Serious ADR rates varied, with candesartan reporting the highest proportion (7.28%). While hepatic anti-fibrotic agents showed promise in addressing liver fibrosis, their ADR profiles underscore the importance of pharmacovigilance and personalized treatment approaches. Future efforts should focus on improving the pharmacovigilance system, expanding population diversity in trials, and conducting ongoing research and extensive post-marketing surveillance.",2025,01,Frontiers in pharmacology,Yuwei Liu; Xu Zhao; Xinrui Wang; Qiang Zhou,2501,True,2025-01-01

We aimed to evaluate the utility of CCR as a noninvasive marker of liver fibrosis in metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This retrospective study included 104 patients with biopsy-proven MASLD. CCR was calculated using serum creatinine and cystatin C levels. Liver fibrosis was staged histologically (F0-F4), and skeletal muscle mass was assessed using the skeletal muscle index (SMI) on computed tomography. Associations between CCR and liver fibrosis, SMI, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease activity score were analyzed. ROC analysis evaluated CCR performance alone and in combination with FIB-4 and enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) scores. CCR values were significantly lower in patients with significant fibrosis (≥F2). The AUROC of CCR for detecting ≥F2 fibrosis was 0.621 (95% CI: 0.509-0.733), with an optimal cutoff of 0.664. CCR alone yielded an AUC of 0.815 for predicting ≥F2 fibrosis. Combining CCR with FIB-4 and ELF substantially improved diagnostic accuracy, increasing the AUROC from 0.621 (CCR alone) to 0.820 for the combined model.

41081666,GLP-1 Receptor Agonists as Emerging Modulators of Inflammation and Angiogenesis in Chronic Cutaneous Wound Healing.,"Diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) represent a clinically burdensome and pathophysiologically distinct complication of diabetes mellitus, marked by persistent inflammation, dysregulated immune signaling, impaired angiogenesis, and delayed re-epithelialization. Despite adherence to standardized wound care protocols, DFUs remain recalcitrant to healing, contributing to high rates of recurrence, infection, and lower extremity amputation. Although established in glycemic control, glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) exert pleiotropic immunomodulatory and regenerative effects relevant to cutaneous repair. This narrative review summarizes mechanistic insights derived from in vitro and animal models through which GLP-1 RA may suppress TNF-α and NF-κB signaling; activate adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase and phosphoinositide 3-kinase/protein kinase B pathways; and promote keratinocyte migration, endothelial progenitor cell function, and macrophage polarization toward reparative phenotypes. Additional mechanisms include restoration of neutrophil antimicrobial function, modulation of matrix remodeling, and upregulation of angiogenic mediators such as VEGFR-2 and HIF-1α. Preclinical findings suggest that these agents may address key barriers to wound healing. While preliminary findings are promising, clinical trials comparing GLP-1 RA therapy with standard of care are needed. Although still investigational, the topical formulation could expand therapeutic applicability if supported by additional clinical evidence. Given their immunomodulatory and tissue-regenerative properties, GLP-1 RAs may represent an adjunctive therapy for DFUs.",2025,Oct,The Journal of investigative dermatology,Johanna Ghebrehiwet-Kuflom; Alisha Mehta; Pallas Lim; Sara Dahle; R Rivkah Isseroff,1675,True,2025-10-01
41158474,Liver transplantations in Finland over 40 years: evolution and recent trends.,"Liver transplantation (LT) is a life-saving treatment for patients with end-stage liver disease, with significant improvements in short-term survival over the decades. However, long-term survival and trends in LT indications and outcomes remain areas of active research. This registry-based study evaluates 40 years of LT in Finland, assessing patient and graft survival, retransplantation rates, changing recipient and donor demographics, indications and benchmarking outcomes against international standards. Data were extracted from the nationwide Finnish LT registry, covering all LTs performed in Finland between 1982 and 2024. Survival analyses were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier methodology and retransplantation rates were assessed using the cumulative incidence function. Benchmark cases were defined by international criteria. A total of 1763 LTs were performed, with a mean recipient age of 46 years. The most common aetiologies were alcohol-related liver disease (19%) and primary sclerosing cholangitis (PSC; 16%). Over time, recipient and donor age, body mass index and prevalence of diabetes increased. One-year patient survival improved from 83% in the 1980s to 96% in 2020-2024, with the overall 5-year, 10-year, 20-year and 30-year patient survival being 83%, 73%, 53% and 28%, respectively. The retransplantation rate was 13% at 30 years overall and 28% in PSC. Benchmark cases had one-year patient and graft survival rates of 97% and 96%, respectively. Acute rejection rates declined from 62% during 1980-1989 to 19% during 2022-2023. Post-transplant kidney-replacement therapy peaked at 26% in 2010-2021, thereafter decreasing to 8% after the year 2022.

38861859,Chronic treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon receptor co-agonist causes weight loss-independent improvements in hepatic steatosis in mice with diet-induced obesity.,"Co-agonists at the glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucagon receptors (GLP1R/GCGR) show promise as treatments for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Although most co-agonists to date have been heavily GLP1R-biased, glucagon directly acts on the liver to reduce fat content. The aims of this study were to investigate a GCGR-biased co-agonist as treatment for hepatic steatosis in mice. Mice with diet-induced obesity (DIO) were treated with Dicretin, a GLP1/GCGR co-agonist with high potency at the GCGR, Semaglutide (GLP1R monoagonist) or food restriction over 24 days, such that their weight loss was matched. Hepatic steatosis, glucose tolerance, hepatic transcriptomics, metabolomics and lipidomics at the end of the study were compared with Vehicle-treated mice. Dicretin lead to superior reduction of hepatic lipid content when compared to Semaglutide or equivalent weight loss by calorie restriction. Markers of glucose tolerance and insulin resistance improved in all treatment groups. Hepatic transcriptomic and metabolomic profiling demonstrated many changes that were unique to Dicretin-treated mice. These include some known targets of glucagon signaling and others with as yet unclear physiological significance.

MASLD, which includes MASLD and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) has been linked to increased metabolic, cardiovascular, and malignant morbidity. Progression into fibrotic stages of MASLD is also strongly associated with liver-related mortality. The past few years have seen a heightened focus on creating innovative therapeutic strategies for MASH management. GLP-1 receptor agonists (RA) have also emerged as a potential treatment option. Studies on GLP-1 agonists, such as liraglutide and semaglutide, have demonstrated efficacy in MASH management, albeit with limited histological improvement of fibrosis. However, recent investigations into GLP-1/GIP RA (tirzepatide) and Glucagon/GLP-1 RA (survodutide) have shown even more encouraging results, with higher rates of MASH resolution and fibrosis improvement. The tolerability of these medications due to their gastrointestinal side effects remains a major concern.

Sub-analysis of the REALSEM-SP study involving OWS-Sema-naïve patients with T2DM. Changes in SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) and influencing factors were analyzed over 12 months. One hundred seventy-eight patients were included (mean age 61±10 years, 43.8% female, 79.2% with hypertension). Median baseline SBP and DBP were 132 [122-145] and 80 [72-88]mmHg, respectively. SBP decreased by -4mmHg at 6 months and -2mmHg at 12 months (p=0.014), while DBP showed no significant change (p=0.395). Factors independently associated with SBP reduction at 6 months included uncontrolled BP and a glomerular filtration rate ≥60mL/min/1.73m OWS-Sema was associated with significant reductions in office SBP in T2DM patients, especially those with uncontrolled baseline BP, independent of BMI changes or dose.

41057370,Aloesin activates Nrf2 signaling to attenuate obesity-associated oxidative stress and hepatic steatosis in high-fat diet-fed rats.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent metabolic disorder characterized by hepatic steatosis, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. With limited therapeutic options available, there is growing interest in safe bioactive compounds that target underlying mechanisms. Aloesin, a chromone isolated from Aloe vera, possesses potent antioxidants and hypoglycemic properties; however, its protective effect against NAFLD has not been previously examined. This study investigated the hepatoprotective potential of aloesin in rats with high-fat diet (HFD)-induced NAFLD, focusing on the role of Nrf2 signaling. Adult male Wistar rats were divided into seven groups (n = 8/group): control, control + aloesin (200 mg/kg), HFD alone, HFD + aloesin (50, 100, or 200 mg/kg), and HFD + aloesin (200 mg/kg) + brusatol (0.2 mg/kg, i.p.). Treatments were administered twice weekly for 12 weeks. Aloesin dose-dependently improved metabolic and hepatic profiles, reducing body and liver weights, fasting glucose, insulin, HbA1c, HOMA-IR, and serum and hepatic levels of triglycerides, cholesterol, and LDL-c, with 200 mg/kg showing the greatest efficacy. It increased hepatic glucokinase and decreased G6Pase activity. Liver histology revealed restored architecture and reduced inflammation. Serum ALT, AST, and GGT were significantly lowered. Molecular analyses showed increased nuclear Nrf2 and antioxidant markers (GSH, SOD, HO-1), with suppressed NF-κB, TNF-α, IL-6, Bax, and caspase-3, and upregulated Bcl-2. Aloesin also modulated lipid metabolism by decreasing SREBP1 and increasing PPARα expression. These effects were reversed by brusatol, confirming Nrf2 pathway involvement. In conclusion, aloesin confers potent Nrf2-mediated protection against NAFLD, with 200 mg/kg as the optimal therapeutic dose.",2025,Oct,Scientific reports,Sarah M Alamri; Laila Naif Al-Harbi; Ghedeir M Alshammari; Nawal A Albadr; Ali Saleh; Mohammed Abdo Yahya,1816,True,2025-10-01
41114602,The impact of GLP-1 agonists on sleep disorders: spotlight on sleep apnea.,"For the first time in history, a medication - tirzepatide, has been approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). This approval adds to the current array of therapeutic options and raises many issues regarding the future of treatment for OSA; in particular, the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in the chronic management of patients with OSA. This review aims to summarize the impact of GLP-1 RAs for the treatment of OSA in the context of the recent FDA approval of tirzepatide following the SURMOUNT-OSA trial. The FDA approval of tirzepatide for OSA represents a major shift from symptom-based management with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) toward a weight-centered, disease-modifying strategy. Questions remain about whether benefits from GLP-1 RAs are purely weight-mediated, or whether they involve direct respiratory effects as well. Moving forward, pharmacotherapy could transform OSA management into a more individualized framework which views the condition as a chronic metabolic disease rather than solely a mechanical airway disorder.",2025,Oct,Expert opinion on pharmacotherapy,Caroline S Mifsud; Bhanu Prakash Kolla; David R Rushlow; Meghna P Mansukhani,1159,True,2025-10-01
39088384,Treatment of Metabolic (Dysfunction)-Associated Fatty Liver Disease: Evidence from Randomized Controlled Trials-A Short Review.,"Metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MALFD) is a highly prevalent and progressive disease, strongly related to obesity, metabolic syndrome, and cardiovascular disease. It comprises a spectrum of liver pathology from steatosis (fat accumulation in the hepatocytes) to steatosis with inflammation (metabolic-associated steatohepatitis, MASH), fibrosis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There is currently only one medication, resmetirom, US Food and Drug Administration approved for the treatment of MALFD. Evidence from randomized trials supports the efficacy of hypocaloric diets and exercise in MASH resolution. Moreover, substantial weight loss after bariatric surgery can lead to significant and longitudinally sustained MASH resolution, improvement in liver fibrosis, and decrease in the risk of major cardiovascular adverse events. Pioglitazone, an insulin sensitizer, initiated at the early stages, before the progression to fibrosis, may be effective in resolution of MASH in patients with or without type 2 diabetes. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs), semaglutide and liraglutide, may also be effective in resolution of MASH but not of fibrosis. Preliminary data from interventions with tirzepatide, a dual GLP-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide RA, and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors are encouraging, but more data based on liver biopsy are needed.",2024,Dec,Metabolic syndrome and related disorders,Konstantinos Kitsios; Christina-Maria Trakatelli; Christina Antza; Areti Triantafyllou; Maria Sarigianni; Vasilios Kotsis,1420,True,2024-12-01

40926269,"Nuclear receptors in metabolic, inflammatory, and oncologic diseases: mechanisms, therapeutic advances, and future directions.","Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to metabolic, hormonal, and environmental signals. These receptors play a critical role in metabolic homeostasis, inflammation, immune function, and disease pathogenesis, positioning them as key therapeutic targets. This review explores the mechanistic roles of NRs such as PPARs, FXR, LXR, and thyroid hormone receptors (THRs) in regulating lipid and glucose metabolism, energy expenditure, cardiovascular health, and neurodegeneration. The therapeutic landscape for NRs has expanded with the approval of drugs like PPARγ agonists (pioglitazone, rosiglitazone) for diabetes, FXR agonists (obeticholic acid) for liver diseases, and selective TR agonists (resmetirom) for Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis (MASH). However, challenges such as tissue-specific activation, drug resistance in chronic diseases, and potential carcinogenic risks continue to limit the full clinical efficacy of NR-targeted therapies. Emerging therapeutic strategies, including selective nuclear receptor modulators (SNRMs), dual and pan-NR agonists, and gene therapy approaches, aim to enhance receptor specificity while minimizing adverse effects. Furthermore, advances in artificial intelligence-driven drug discovery, CRISPR-based gene therapy, and microbiome-targeted interventions hold significant promise for refining the therapeutic efficacy and safety of NR-based treatments. A deeper understanding of NR crosstalk with metabolic, inflammatory, and oncogenic pathways will be crucial for developing next-generation therapies to overcome resistance mechanisms and improve clinical outcomes. These advancements, combined with precision medicine approaches, are poised to revolutionize NR-targeted therapies, offering more precise, effective, and safer treatments for a range of metabolic, inflammatory, and oncological diseases.",2025,Sep,European journal of medical research,Mohammed A Abdel-Rasol; Wael M El-Sayed,1952,True,2025-09-01
41076041,Placebo Rates in Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatohepatitis Clinical Trials: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.,"High placebo response rates complicate drug development in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) clinical trials. We performed a meta-analysis to quantify placebo response and assess influencing factors. MEDLINE, Embase, and CENTRAL were searched from inception to May 7, 2025 for placebo-controlled trials of pharmacological interventions for MASH. Placebo response rates were pooled by random-effects model and meta-regression was used to evaluate the effects of patient and trial design factors on the primary outcomes. One-hundred and twenty-seven studies (6,880 participants) were included. For the primary outcome, the pooled proportion of non-cirrhotic placebo patients achieving MASH resolution without worsening of fibrosis was 11% (95% CI: 8% to 14%). Meta-regression did not identify any significant patient or trial characteristics associated with placebo response. For the second primary outcome, the proportion of cirrhotic placebo patients whose Model for End-stage Liver Disease score increased from below 12 to ≥15 was 4% (95% CI 1% to 13%). Regarding secondary outcomes, 12% (95% CI: 8% to 18%) of placebo patients achieved normal alanine aminotransferase levels, and 22% (95% CI: 18% to 27%) showed an absolute reduction of 5% in hepatic fat content. Additionally, 19% of placebo patients (95% CI: 16% to 22%) achieved a relative reduction of 30% in fat content, while 2% (95% CI: 0.7% to 3%) progressed to cirrhosis.

41139042,Proanthocyanidins from Iris lactea Pall. var. chinensis (Fisch.) Koidz alleviate non-alcoholic fatty liver disease by regulating lipid metabolism via AMPK/SREBP-1c signalling pathway.,"Iris lactea Pall var. chinensis (Fisch.) Koidz (Iris lactea), a widely recognized traditional Chinese medicine, is used to clear dampness and heat, promote swelling and detoxifying, and reduce jaundice hepatitis. Proanthocyanidins (PC) are the main active substances in Iris lactea that alleviate hepatic injury. However, the efficacy and potential pharmacological mechanism of PC against non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) remain poorly understood. To investigate the pharmacological efficacy and underlying mechanism of PC in treating NAFLD. To model NAFLD, HepG2 cells were induced with oleic acid (OA); zebrafish and C57BL/6J mice were fed a high-fat diet (HFD). The anti-NAFLD effects of various dosages of PC were evaluated in cell and animal models using biochemical indices and histological analyses. Hepatic lipidomic analysis was used to analyse and screen biomarkers. The levels of proteins involved in lipid metabolism, oxidative stress, and inflammation were determined using Western blot. Additionally, the attenuating effects of eight flavan-3-ols compounds on hepatic steatosis were evaluated in OA-induced HepG2 cells. PC significantly attenuated lipid accumulation and oxidative stress in both OA-induced HepG2 cells and HFD-induced zebrafish. In HFD-induced NAFLD mice, PC administration reduced body weight, liver indices, and serum lipid levels. Oil red O staining confirmed reduced hepatic lipid deposition, while HE staining and ELISA results demonstrated attenuated inflammatory infiltration and decreased pro-inflammatory cytokine levels. Hepatic lipidomics analysis revealed that PC modulated metabolites associated with glycerophospholipid and glycerolipid metabolism. Western blot analysis demonstrated that PC downregulated lipogenesis-related (SREBP-1c, FAS, ACC and SCD-1) and inflammation-associated proteins (p-IKK, p-NF-κB, and p-IκBα), while upregulating proteins involved in fatty acid oxidation (CPTA1 and PPARα), lipolysis (HSL and ATGL), and antioxidant responses (HO-1 and Nrf2), as well as phosphorylated AMPK. Flavan-3-ol compounds similarly suppressed lipogenic proteins and attenuated hepatic steatosis in vitro. These findings indicate that PC restores lipid homeostasis and mitigates inflammation in NAFLD, potentially by modulating of the AMPK/SREBP-1c signalling pathway and reorganising of glycerophospholipid and glycerolipid metabolism.",2025,Oct,Journal of ethnopharmacology,Fangfang Tie; Lichengcheng Ren; Yidan Gao; Yun Wu; Qi Dong; Honglun Wang; Na Hu,2395,True,2025-10-01
41072890,"Linking GLP-1 activation with steroidogenesis, redox, endoplasmic reticulum stress, mitophagy, and the apoptotic regulatory network unlocks the emerging impacts of semaglutide on 5-fluorouracil-induced testicular toxicity.","One of the recent growing complications of neoplastic chemotherapy that is considered a challenge in their therapeutic protocol is testicular dysfunction. The pathogenesis of testicular injury is multifactorial, involving various pathogenic mechanisms, including oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ERS), and mitochondrial dysfunction. Semaglutide (Sema), a GLP1 agonist, is repurposed nowadays in multiple conditions ascribed to its effectiveness in shielding against oxidative stress and ERS, along with boosting mitochondrial biogenesis. Accordingly, this study proposes to investigate the use of Sema as adjunctive therapy in a 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) treatment protocol to diminish its testicular dysfunction complications. Rats were allocated into five groups. Group I: normal control group; Group II was injected with Sema (12 μg/kg, s.c.) once weekly for 30 days. Groups III (5-FU group), IV, and V were injected with 5-FU (20 mg/kg, every other day, i.p.) for 30 days. Group IV (Sema-treated group) was injected with Sema, while group V (Blocker group) was injected with exendin 9-39 (50 μg/kg, once weekly, I.V.). The results revealed that activation of GLP-1 attenuated 5-FU-induced testicular dysfunction by enhancing the PINK-1/Parkin axis and mitochondrial biogenesis, eliminating ERS-related proteins (PERK, ATF6, GRP78, and CHOP). Sema activated the Nrf2/HO-1 hub, improved steroidogenesis and spermatogenesis by elevating STAR/DAZL and serum FSH, LH, and testosterone levels. This study highlighted the use of Sema as adjunctive therapy in the 5-FU treatment protocol to guard against the associated testicular dysfunction, via modulating oxidative stress, ERS, and mitochondrial dysfunction in the rat experimental model.",2025,Nov,Life sciences,Noha F Hassan; Haneen Y Khidr; Rania Farag A Eltelbany; Mona M Abd El-Galil; Enji Reda; Nahla A El-Zohairy; Ayah M H Gowifel,1750,True,2025-11-01

This contributes to a high prevalence of obesity, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes in this population, ultimately reducing life expectancy. Traditional weight management strategies, such as behavioural interventions, are often less feasible in this group. Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), initially developed for type 2 diabetes, have shown promise in addressing AIWG by reducing weight, improving metabolic parameters, and offering potential neuroprotective and psychiatric benefits. Evidence supports the efficacy of GLP-1RAs in managing AIWG, with studies demonstrating substantial reductions in weight and body mass index without exacerbating psychiatric symptoms. However, access to these medications remains limited due to high costs and restrictive healthcare policies. Expanding access to GLP-1RAs could bridge a critical gap in care for patients with SPMI, improving both physical and mental health outcomes.

36104546,Early Cost-Effectiveness and Price Threshold Analyses of Resmetirom: An Investigational Treatment for Management of Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis.,"Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is characterized by inflammation and hepatocellular damage caused by accumulation of fat in the liver. Resmetirom (MGL-3196) is an orally administered, small-molecule, liver-targeted, selective thyroid hormone receptor-β agonist. This early analysis explored the potential cost effectiveness of resmetirom for the treatment of NASH from a US commercial payer perspective. An early economic model was developed to reflect the clinical pathways typically followed by patients with NASH and liver fibrosis. Use of resmetirom, compared with placebo, was assessed. The Markov model structure was informed by a previous modeling study and a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase II trial of resmetirom. Costs and outcomes were assessed over a lifetime time horizon with results presented in terms of cost per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained. Resmetirom treatment resulted in increased costs of US$66,764 per patient, while increasing QALYs by 1.24. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was US$53,929 per QALY gained, indicating resmetirom treatment would potentially be cost effective at a willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold of US$100,000. Results indicated that resmetirom would reduce the lifetime number of cases of decompensated cirrhosis (- 87), hepatocellular carcinoma (- 59), and liver transplants (- 30) per 1,000 patients compared with placebo. Resmetirom treatment remained cost effective at a US$100,000 WTP threshold up to a daily price point of US$72.00.

This prospective multicohort study included 153 192 patients with MASLD from UK Biobank (UKB), 29 700 from Kailuan cohort and 3329 from China Kadoorie Biobank (CKB). Lean MASLD was defined as body mass index (BMI)<23 kg/m² in Kailuan and CKB and <25 kg/m² in UKB. Primary endpoints were liver-related events (LREs), all-cause mortality, liver-related mortality (LRM), cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality, CVD, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and extrahepatic cancer. Overall, 181 191 non-lean and 5030 lean patients with MASLD were included.

We conducted a nationwide matched case-control study leveraging data from the Swedish Epidemiology Strengthened by histoPathology Reports in Sweden (ESPRESSO) cohort, which includes liver biopsy data spanning from 1969 to 2017. We identified 12,172 patients with MASLD and 56,831 matched general-population controls, including 5,478 patients with MASLD with 10,682 sibling controls. Conditional logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism defined through ICD codes or prescription records. Causal inference was examined using Mendelian randomization (MR). Both observational and MR mediation analyses were performed to explore the roles of metabolic features. Hypothyroidism was associated with 1.68-fold increased odds of MASLD (95% CI 1.36-2.06). The association remained stable in the analysis using siblings as controls. However, in absolute terms, hypothyroidism was uncommon and seen in 2.5% in people with MASLD and in 1.4% of controls. Higher genetically predicted thyroid-stimulating hormone levels and hypothyroidism were linked to increased MASLD risk. Mediation analysis showed that metabolic disorders contributed ∼41% to this risk. Furthermore, there was an inverse association between hyperthyroidism and MASLD (adjusted odds ratio 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.56); however, the association did not reach statistical significance in the MR analysis. The findings suggest that hypothyroidism is associated with a heightened risk of MASLD and that hyperthyroidism is potentially protective against MASLD. The approval by the US FDA of resmetirom, a thyroid hormone receptor β-selective agonist for non-cirrhotic metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with stage 2-3 fibrosis, highlights the potential role of thyroid dysfunction in metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). This study identified hypothyroidism as a risk factor for MASLD, especially in men and individuals younger than 40 years, with the association peaking at non-cirrhotic fibrosis. Metabolic disorders mediated ∼41% of the hypothyroidism-MASLD association. Hyperthyroidism was potentially inversely associated with MASLD. Despite its low prevalence (2.5% in MASLD cases, 1.4% in controls), the population health impact of hypothyroidism warrants further attention.",2025,May,JHEP reports : innovation in hepatology,Shuai Yuan; Fahim Ebrahimi; David Bergman; Marijana Vujković; Eleonora Scorletti; Xixin Ruan; Jie Chen; Hannes Hagström; Jonas F Ludvigsson,2631,True,2025-05-01
41120751,TDP-43 loss induces cryptic polyadenylation in ALS/FTD.,"Nuclear depletion and cytoplasmic aggregation of the RNA-binding protein TDP-43 are cellular hallmarks of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). TDP-43 nuclear loss causes de-repression of cryptic exons, yet cryptic alternative polyadenylation (APA) events have been largely overlooked. In this study, we developed a bioinformatic pipeline to reliably identify alternative last exons, 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) extensions and intronic polyadenylation APA event types, and we identified cryptic APA sites induced by TDP-43 loss in induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. TDP-43 binding sites are enriched at sites of these cryptic events, and TDP-43 can both repress and enhance APA. All categories of cryptic APA were also identified in ALS and frontotemporal dementia (FTD) postmortem brain tissue. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), thiol(SH)-linked alkylation for the metabolic sequencing of RNA (SLAM-seq) and ribosome profiling (Ribo-seq) revealed that distinct cryptic APA categories have different downstream effects on transcript levels and that cryptic 3'UTR extensions can increase RNA stability, leading to increased translation. In summary, we demonstrate that TDP-43 nuclear depletion induces cryptic APA, expanding the palette of known consequences of TDP-43.",2025,Oct,Nature neuroscience,Sam Bryce-Smith; Anna-Leigh Brown; Max Z Y J Chien; Dario Dattilo; Puja R Mehta; Francesca Mattedi; Simone Barattucci; Alla Mikheenko; Matteo Zanovello; Flaminia Pellegrini; Sara Emad El-Agamy; Matthew Yome; Sarah E Hill; Yue A Qi; Kai Sun; Eugeni Ryadnov; Yixuan Wan; Jose Norberto S Vargas; Nicol Birsa; Towfique Raj; Jack Humphrey; Matthew Keuss; Oscar G Wilkins; Michael Ward; Maria Secrier; Pietro Fratta,1282,True,2025-10-01

The growing epidemic of high fructose consumption has been linked to increased prevalence of obesity, type 2 diabetes, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease. Increasing evidence indicates that high dietary fructose can exert direct effects on the heart as well as the vasculature. Several underlying mechanisms involving metabolic disturbances, oxidative stress and inflammation have been demonstrated to induce cardiac dysfunction and vascular abnormalities. Accordingly, the intent of this review is to discuss the metabolic consequences of increased fructose consumption and to provide an overview of the mechanisms associated with fructose-enriched diet-induced cardiovascular abnormalities. A description of some novel interventions that attenuate both cardiac and vascular dysfunction subsequent to fructose over consumption is also provided. The high intakes of fructose present a public health hazard, and thus there is a pressing need to increase public awareness on the harmful health effects, including cardiovascular health, of high intake of foods and beverages enriched with fructose. Furthermore, the supplementation of processed foods and beverages with fructose additives needs regulation.",2025,Oct,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,Paramjit S Tappia; Elle Garriock; Bram Ramjiawan; Mohammed H Moghadasian,1371,True,2025-10-01

Presently, liver transplantation is the most effective radical treatment, but it is difficult to be widely carried out due to the problems of large surgical trauma, lack of liver donors, and strong immunological rejection. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) are a type of stem cell with characteristics of self-replication, multidirectional differentiation, and easy accessibility.

We investigated the relationship between SDoH and mortality in individuals with MASLD in the US. We conducted a retrospective analysis using data from the 2007-2016 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, with follow-up mortality data assessed through 2019. SDoH score was derived from questionnaires, and MASLD was defined using non-invasive panels and cardiometabolic criteria. Cox regression models were used to evaluate the association between SDoH and all-cause/cause-specific mortality among individuals with MASLD. We analysed 12,321 individuals with MASLD (mean age: 47.0 years; 48.4% males). Over a median follow-up period of 7.6 years, higher SDoH scores were associated with progressively increased hazards of all-cause mortality. The results remained consistent in a multivariable model. Additionally, higher unfavourable SDoH scores were associated with increased cardiovascular and cancer-related mortality. Specifically, there was a 32% increase in hazards for all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.25-1.38) and increases of 29% and 21% for cardiovascular (HR: 1.29, 95% CI: 1.19-1.40) and cancer-related mortality (HR: 1.21, 95% CI: 1.07-1.36), respectively, for each one-point increase in SDoH score. Employment status, food insecurity, family income, private insurance coverage, and marital status were independently associated with all-cause mortality in individuals with MASLD.

This study aims to (1) validate a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) rat model in comparison to RYGB operated humans and (2) investigate the correlation of amino acids with GLP-1 and PYY levels in both species. Fasting plasma samples were derived from the randomized controlled WAS trial (NCT01352403; RYGB = 20, Controls = 17) at baseline and after 12 months and from male Wistar rats with diet-induced obesity seven weeks after surgery (RYGB = 12, sham surgery = 12). 18 peptide hormones and 21 amino acids were measured using magnetic multiplex assays, ELISA and LC-MS/MS. Levels of GLP-1 and PYY3-36 were found to be significantly lower in humans after RYGB (both p < 0.001), while in rats a trend towards an increase was observed. Fasting insulin was found to be lower in humans (p < 0.001) and rats (p < 0.01) after RYGB. Leptin was significantly lower in humans (p < 0.001) and rats (p < 0.05) after RYGB. The cytokines IL-6 and MCP-1 were significantly lower in humans (p < 0.01, p < 0.05), but unchanged in rats after RYGB. Interestingly, GLP-1 levels in humans before RYGB correlated positively with the weight change after 12 months (Pearson's r = 0.733;p < 0.05). Leucine showed a positive correlation with GLP-1 levels 12 months after RYGB in humans (Pearson's r = 0.588;p < 0.05), but not in rats. Preoperative GLP-1 levels in humans correlate with weight loss after RYGB and could potentially be predictive.

This review summarizes the current evidence on the effects of GLP-1 RAs on various psychiatric and neurocognitive conditions to evaluate their clinical benefits and potential risks. The literature has revealed a complex and multifaceted psychiatric profile. For depression and anxiety, the evidence is conflicting, with large observational studies showing contradictory results that are largely attributable to confounding by indication or methodological differences in the study design. In contrast, consistent and positive evidence suggests therapeutic potential for substance use disorders, particularly alcohol use disorders. Furthermore, emerging data indicate a significant neuroprotective role, with several cohort studies indicating a reduced risk of dementia. The major public and regulatory attention regarding suicidality appears to be driven by the methodological limitations of the initial reports, as well-controlled active comparator studies have not found an increased risk. However, the safety of GLP-1 RAs in high-risk psychiatric populations has not been established. In conclusion, while GLP-1 RAs show considerable therapeutic potential, their unresolved safety profile in patients with preexisting psychiatric conditions necessitates a cautious clinical approach. Future large-scale randomized controlled trials that include psychiatric populations are crucial for clarifying the direct neuromodulatory effects of these agents and establishing guidelines for their safe use.",2025,01,Journal of Yeungnam medical science,JinWoo Kim,1776,True,2025-01-01

39658733,Hepatic thyroid hormone receptor-β signalling: Mechanisms and recent advancements in the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.,"The pharmacotherapy of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its progressive form, the metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), remains a hot topic in research and a largely unmet need in clinical practice. As the first approval of a disease-specific drug, resmetirom, was regarded as a milestone for the management of this common liver disease, this comprehensive and updated review aimed to highlight the importance of the hepatic thyroid hormone (TH) receptor (THR)-β signalling for the treatment of MASH, with a special focus on resmetirom. First, the genomic and non-genomic actions of the liver-directed THR-β mediated mechanisms are summarized. THR-β has a key role in hepatic lipid and carbohydrate metabolism; disruption of THR-β signalling leads to dysmetabolism, thus promoting MASLD and possibly its progression to MASH and cirrhosis. In the clinical setting, this is translated into a significant association between primary hypothyroidism and MASLD, as confirmed by recent meta-analyses. An association between MASLD and subclinical intrahepatic hypothyroidism (i.e. a state of relatively low hepatic triiodothyronine concentrations, with circulating TH concentrations within the normal range) is also emerging and under investigation. In line with this, the favourable results of the phase 3 placebo-controlled MAESTRO trials led to the recent conditional approval of resmetirom by the US FDA for treating adults with MASH and moderate-to-advanced fibrosis. This conditional approval of resmetirom opened a new window to the management of this common and burdensome liver disease, thus bringing the global scientific community in front of new perspectives and challenges.",2025,Apr,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Stergios A Polyzos; Giovanni Targher,1734,True,2025-04-01

However, the correlation between the ZJU index and MASLD in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) patients remains to be elucidated. To investigate the association between the ZJU index and MASLD among patients with T2DM. This cross-sectional study was conducted on hospitalised patients diagnosed with T2DM. Anthropometric measurements, laboratory data, and ultrasound results were initially collected from all patients. The ZJU index was subsequently calculated. Regression analysis was then used to explore risk factors affecting MASLD, and the optimal ZJU index cut-off value for diagnosing MASLD was determined using restricted cubic spline analysis. Finally, a new model for predicting MASLD in T2DM patients based on the ZJU index was constructed. This model was based on the risk factors identified by regression analysis, and the area under curve values were calculated. The validity and reliability of the models were then compared with each other. A total of 688 patients with T2DM were included in this study. A significant positive correlation was identified between the ZJU index and the development of MASLD. Furthermore, the results of the restricted cubic spline analysis showed a non-linear association between ZJU index and MASLD. The ZJU value of 38.87 was identified as the key threshold for diagnosing MASLD. The new predictive model, which was developed by regression analysis, demonstrated a higher diagnostic value for MASLD and exhibited good accuracy in comparison with metabolic indices alone (area under curve = 0.76, 95% confidence interval: 0.72-0.80).

41098220,Inflammation: The Mother of All Diseases Meets the Mother of All Therapies.,"Incretins are small peptides secreted by the gastrointestinal tract. These peptides exert their action by binding to G-protein-coupled receptors that are widely distributed in the pancreas, throughout the gastrointestinal tract, and the brain. The physiological role of incretins (such as GLP-1) is to regulate glucose levels by increasing insulin secretion, delaying gastric emptying, and decreasing appetite, leading to weight loss. In this review, we aimed to report the effects of inflammation on human health and how GLP-1 and GLP-1 receptor agonists, which are now being used as first-line agents to control obesity, can have a broader effect on human diseases. The literature shows the benefits of these drugs in diseases other than obesity, including in diseases of many organs such as heart, kidneys, liver, blood vessels, and in neurodegenerative and psychiatric conditions. These diverse beneficial effects are attributed to the anti-inflammatory activities of these new drugs. The physiological actions of incretins have recently been better understood. The surprisingly diverse therapeutic activities of this class of new drugs suggest that they will likely play central roles not only in the management of type-2 diabetes but for the treatment of obesity and a wide spectrum of diseases for which inflammation is a major factor.",2025,Oct,EJIFCC,Miyo K Chatanaka; Eleftherios P Diamandis,1343,True,2025-10-01
41064709,When New Therapies Meet Old Challenges: Tirzepatide-Warfarin Interaction in A Mechanical Mitral Valve Patient.,"Tirzepatide is a medication capable of controlling blood glucose levels through the dual agonism of GIP and GLP-1 receptors. In particular, GLP-1 reduces food intake and delays gastric emptying. We report the case of a 66-year-old woman hospitalised with a medical history notable for grade III obesity and a mechanical mitral valve prosthesis. Given the severity of obesity and the high overall cardiovascular risk, tirzepatide was initiated on the day after admission. After 10 days of therapy, routine blood tests revealed an unexpectedly significant reduction in INR values, despite the patient following a strict and stable diet. The therapeutic INR target was gradually achieved only after approximately three weeks of progressive increases in daily warfarin dosage. Although tirzepatide has no known direct effects on INR, it could indirectly influence its values by delaying gastric emptying.

41060409,[What is established in the medical treatment of heart failure?].,"The treatment of heart failure varies depending on left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and poses a significant clinical challenge in patients with reduced (HFrEF), mildly reduced (HFmrEF), or preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF). In HFrEF/HFmrEF, the diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms such as dyspnea or peripheral edema, as well as an LVEF < 50%. Treatment primarily relies on renin-angiotensin system (RAS) inhibitors (preferably angiotensin receptor-neprilysin-inhibitors, ARNIs), beta-blockers, mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs), and sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2i). These agents have a class I recommendation and significantly reduce both mortality and hospitalization rates. Rapid and comprehensive implementation of this therapeutic strategy substantially improves prognosis. Additional agents such as ivabradine or vericiguat can be considered. With the recent publication of the DIGIT-HF study, evidence now also supports the use of digitoxin in advanced HFrEF to further reduce mortality and hospitalizations. Iron deficiency is common in HFrEF and is associated with worse outcomes. Intravenous iron supplementation improves exercise capacity and reduces the risk of hospitalization especially after a decompensation. In patients with HFpEF, treatment focuses on symptomatic relief and rigorous management of comorbidities. Diuretics for volume overload have a class I recommendation, as they effectively alleviate symptoms. SGLT2i also play a key role in HFpEF and are recommended with class I evidence in current guidelines. FINEARTS-HF recently showed promising results for the non-steroidal MRA finerenone, which reduces cardiovascular death/hospitalizations. Furthermore, metabolically targeted therapies such as GLP‑1 receptor agonists are gaining importance in obese HFpEF patients, as they have been shown to improve quality of life and reduce heart failure-related events. Die Behandlung der Herzinsuffizienz differiert je nach linksventrikulärer Ejektionsfraktion (LVEF) und stellt sowohl für Patienten mit reduzierter (HFrEF) oder leicht reduzierter Ejektionsfraktion (HFmrEF) als auch für Patienten mit erhaltener Ejektionsfraktion (HFpEF) eine klinische Herausforderung dar. Bei der HFrEF/HFmrEF wird die Diagnose anhand klinischer Symptome wie Dyspnoe oder peripherer Ödeme sowie einer LVEF < 50 % gestellt. Die Therapie stützt sich vor allem auf die sogenannten „Fantastic Four“: Inhibitoren des Renin-Angiotensin-Systems (RAS; bevorzugt Angiotensinrezeptor-Neprilysin-Inhibitoren [ARNI]), Betablocker, Mineralokortikoidrezeptorantagonisten (MRA) und Natrium-Glukose-Kotransporter-2-Inhibitoren (SGLT2i). Diese Medikamente besitzen eine Klasse-I-Empfehlung und reduzieren signifikant Mortalität und Hospitalisierungsraten. Die schnelle und vollständige Umsetzung der Therapie verbessert die Prognose maßgeblich. Ergänzend kann Ivabradin oder Vericiguat eingesetzt werden. Mit der kürzlich publizierten DIGIT-HF-Studie liegt nun auch Evidenz vor für den Einsatz von Digitoxin bei fortgeschrittener HFrEF, um Mortalität und Hospitalisierungen zu senken. Häufig tritt bei HFrEF ein Eisenmangel auf, der mit einer schlechteren Prognose verbunden ist. Eine intravenöse Eisensubstitution verbessert die Belastbarkeit und reduziert Rehospitalisierungen, insbesondere nach einer Dekompensation. Bei Patienten mit HFpEF liegt der Fokus auf einer symptomatischen Behandlung sowie der konsequenten Therapie von Komorbiditäten. Diuretika zur Volumenentlastung haben eine Klasse-I-Empfehlung, da sie effektiv Symptome lindern. Eine zentrale Rolle bei HFpEF haben die SGLT2i, die ebenfalls mit Klasse-I-Empfehlung in den Leitlinien abgebildet sind. Die Studie FINEARTS-HF zeigte kürzlich vielversprechende Ergebnisse für den nichtsteroidalen MRA Finerenon, der kardiovaskuläre Todesfälle und Herzinsuffizienz-Hospitalisierungen reduziert. Außerdem gewinnen metabolisch orientierte Therapien, etwa mit Glucagon-like-peptide-1(GLP-1)-Rezeptor-Agonisten bei adipösen Patienten mit HFpEF, an Bedeutung, da sie Lebensqualität und Ereignisrate verbessern.",2025,Oct,"Innere Medizin (Heidelberg, Germany)",Samira Soltani; Johann Bauersachs,4105,True,2025-10-01
41151201,Interventions for prediabetes: an umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials.,"This umbrella review synthesized evidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effectiveness of interventions for preventing adverse outcomes in individuals with prediabetes. A total of 23 meta-analyses comprising 602 RCTs and over 30,000 participants were analyzed from databases including Medline, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane through February 1, 2025. Interventions evaluated included both pharmacological and non-pharmacological strategies compared to placebo or usual care. Studies reporting only bio-humoral markers were excluded. The GRADE approach was used to assess the certainty of evidence. Among 15 evaluated interventions, four were supported by high-certainty evidence for diabetes prevention: GLP-1 receptor agonists (RR = 0.26), liraglutide/exenatide/semaglutide (OR = 0.29), orlistat (OR = 0.67), and structured self-care programs (OR = 0.58). High-certainty evidence also supported modest reductions in systolic blood pressure (∼2-3 mmHg) from lifestyle interventions, digital health tools, and liraglutide. Significant reductions in BMI and waist circumference were observed with pharmacologic agents, aerobic exercise, and digital platforms. However, metformin combined with lifestyle changes did not yield notable anthropometric benefits. These findings underscore the value of a multidimensional and personalized approach to prediabetes management, emphasizing evidence-based pharmacological options alongside behavioral and digital health strategies.

39609879,Similar weight loss with semaglutide regardless of diabetes and cardiometabolic risk parameters in individuals with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: Post hoc analysis of three randomised controlled trials.,"Weight loss mediated by glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analogues is lower in patients with type 2 diabetes versus those without. Type 2 diabetes and obesity are risk factors for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and associated steatohepatitis (MASH). We evaluated weight changes in adults with MASLD/MASH with or without type 2 diabetes receiving the GLP-1 analogue semaglutide. This was a post hoc analysis of data from three 48-72-week randomised trials investigating the effect of semaglutide versus placebo in adults with MASLD (NCT03357380) or biopsy-confirmed MASH (NCT02970942 and NCT03987451). Pooled data for semaglutide (0.4 mg once daily and 2.4 mg once weekly [n = 163]) and placebo (n = 137) were analysed at 1 year. Weight changes were analysed by type 2 diabetes status (type 2 diabetes [n = 209], pre-type 2 diabetes [n = 51] and no diabetes [n = 40]) and by other cardiometabolic risk parameters using analysis of covariance and Spearman's rank correlations. The overall mean weight change was -11.1 kg (-11.7%) and -0.7 kg (-0.6%) with semaglutide and placebo, respectively. While numerically higher for people without type 2 diabetes, estimated treatment differences with semaglutide versus placebo were similar overall for people with type 2 diabetes (-10.2 kg; -10.8%), pre-type 2 diabetes (-9.8 kg; -10.2%) and no diabetes (-11.6 kg; -13.1%). Differences between groups were not statistically significant (p > 0.50 for all). Baseline fasting plasma glucose, glycated haemoglobin, insulin levels, insulin resistance and lipids did not correlate with weight change. People with MASLD/MASH had similar semaglutide-mediated weight loss regardless of type 2 diabetes status and other cardiometabolic risk parameters.",2025,Feb,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Matthew J Armstrong; Takeshi Okanoue; Mads Sundby Palle; Anne-Sophie Sejling; Mohamed Tawfik; Michael Roden,1766,True,2025-02-01
41082318,Podocyte Metabolic Reprogramming and Targeted Therapy.,"Podocytes, highly specialized glomerular epithelial cells, are essential for maintaining the filtration barrier integrity, yet they are particularly susceptible to metabolic stress. Recent advances have identified metabolic reprogramming as a central driver of podocyte injury in diverse glomerular diseases, including diabetic kidney disease and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Pathological stimuli, such as hyperglycemia, lipotoxicity, oxidative stress, and inflammatory cytokines, lead to profound alterations in podocyte metabolism, encompassing dysregulation of lipid, glucose, amino acid, and ion handling, as well as activation of immunometabolic pathways. These maladaptive changes result in mitochondrial dysfunction, cytoskeletal disorganization, and inflammatory forms of cell death including pyroptosis and ferroptosis. Mechanistic studies have elucidated the roles of nutrient-sensing pathways (AMPK, mTOR, SIRT1), innate immune sensors (NLRP3, cGAS-STING), and metabolic enzymes (CerS6, GLS2, ODC1) in orchestrating this reprogramming. Emerging evidence supports the therapeutic potential of modulating podocyte metabolism, as exemplified by the renoprotective effects of SGLT2 inhibitors, GLP-1 receptor agonists, PPAR agonists, and targeted inhibitors of inflammasome or lipid pathways. This Review synthesizes recent insights into the structural-metabolic coupling in podocytes, dissects the mechanisms of metabolic derangement in disease contexts, and discusses promising therapeutic strategies aimed at restoring metabolic homeostasis. Understanding the intersection between podocyte metabolism and injury response offers novel avenues for the prevention and treatment of chronic glomerular diseases.",2025,Oct,Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN,Hongtu Hu; Wei Liang; Guohua Ding,1724,True,2025-10-01
40934570,Evaluation of developmental and behavioral toxicity of Resmetirom in zebrafish larvae (Danio rerio).,"Resmetirom, a promising oral THR-β agonist for treating metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), has been studied extensively for its therapeutic efficacy, yet its effects on embryonic development remain largely unknown. This study aimed to evaluate the potential embryotoxicity of Resmetirom and investigate its impact on embryonic growth and development. We employed the zebrafish (Danio rerio) as the model organisms, and exposed embryos to varying concentrations of Resmetirom. Key developmental endpoints, including hatchability, mortality, malformation rates, developmental timing, and spontaneous behavior, were systematically assessed. Furthermore, transcriptomic analysis was conducted to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the observed phenotypes. Our findings demonstrated that Resmetirom did not significantly alter hatchability, mortality, or the incidence of morphological malformations. However, exposure to high concentrations (10 μM and 100 μM) induced significant developmental delays and a reduction in spontaneous behaviors. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that Resmetirom exposure dysregulated multiple physiological pathways: the upregulation of a cortisol metabolism-related gene (hsd11b2) may be associated with a shortened stress response; the downregulation of genes critical for fatty acid synthesis (fads2, elovl2) may lead to reduced DHA production and subsequently impair neurodevelopment; suppression of glucose metabolism (gck) could be linked to neuropsychiatric disorders; and the downregulation of a neural function-related gene (gda) may result in neuronal impairment. This study suggests that while Resmetirom may not induce overt teratogenicity, it can cause developmental delays and behavioral abnormalities at high concentrations. These findings provide important initial insights into the potential developmental toxicity of Resmetirom: although acute developmental toxicity is absent, the compound may still impair growth in early life stages and contribute to the onset of depressive symptoms. Such insights not only enhance our understanding of the molecular toxicology of Resmetirom, but also aid in optimizing its clinical application strategies for pediatric and adolescent populations.",2025,Sep,Ecotoxicology and environmental safety,Yunfeng Shan; Zehong Chen; Anqi Guo; Zhengwei Huang; Zhengkang Su; Minjie Ye; Gaofeng Zhang; Xi Li; Chang Cai; Yin Dong,2262,True,2025-09-01
41152039,Pharmacomicrobiomics: Exploring the role of gut microbiota in type 2 diabetes and antidiabetic drug mechanisms.,"The gut microbiota is intricately linked to the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This review aims to explore the bidirectional interaction between antidiabetic drugs and the gut microbiota, focusing on how drugs modulate the microbiome to exert therapeutic effects and how this interaction influences common drug side effects, thereby outlining the role of pharmacomicrobiomics in personalizing T2DM treatment. We comprehensively reviewed literature from PubMed, Scopus, and Embase on gut microbiota, T2DM, and antidiabetic drugs. Evidence indicates that various drug classes (e.g., metformin, sodium glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (RAs), α-glucosidase inhibitors (AGIs)) significantly alter gut microbial composition (e.g., Bacteroidetes - to -Firmicutes ratio), functionality, and metabolite production (e.g., SCFAs, bile acids). These changes contribute not only to glycemic control but also to the drugs' cardiorenal benefits. Conversely, the microbiota influences drug metabolism and is implicated in the manifestation of typical side effects, such as gastrointestinal disturbances from metformin and acarbose. The gut microbiota is a crucial mediator of both the efficacy and toxicity of antidiabetic drugs. Understanding pharmacomicrobiomics provides a novel framework for developing personalized therapeutic strategies in T2DM, potentially using an individual's microbiome as a biomarker for drug selection and side effect prediction.",2025,Oct,"Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD",Dingsheng Wen; Xiangyue Wang; Yanping He; Xiaoqing Hao; Weihua Huang; Honghao Zhou; Wei Zhang; Xiong Li,1522,True,2025-10-01

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 168 T2DM patients receiving dispensary monitoring at the University Specialized Hospital for Active Treatment in Endocrinology ""Acad. Ivan Penchev,"" Sofia. Clinical data, including comorbidities, HbA1c, weight, and BMI, were collected from medical records at baseline and after one year of treatment. Patients were administered subcutaneous semaglutide beginning at 0.25 mg weekly, titrated to 0.5 mg after four weeks, and to 1 mg thereafter, maintained over a one-year period. At baseline, 92.3% of patients had obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m²), with 53.6% categorized as Obesity Class 1. After one year of GLP - 1RA therapy, significant improvements in metabolic parameters were observed. Median weight reduced from 100.0 kg to 91.5 kg (p<0.001), and median BMI decreased from 33.6 to 30.9 kg/m² (p<0.001). HbA1c levels declined from 7.80% to 6.90% (p<0.001). Transitions to lower obesity classes occurred in 81 patients, while 15 remained in Class 3 obesity. Semaglutide significantly improves glycemic control and promotes weight and BMI reduction in T2DM patients in routine clinical practice. These findings suggest that structured follow-up under endocrinologist supervision, as required by national protocols, may enhance therapeutic response. Further prospective studies with extended follow-up are warranted to evaluate the long-term sustainability of these effects and to identify predictors of optimal patient response.",2025,01,Frontiers in endocrinology,Petya Milushewa; Yoanna Mitreva; Nevena Chakarova; Tsvetalina Tankova; Emilia Naseva; Valentina Petkova,1683,True,2025-01-01

Unlike post-bariatric patients, this population lacks prior surgical scars and may have different nutritional and healing profiles. A retrospective comparative case series was conducted from January 2022 to November 2024. Twenty patients who achieved massive weight loss (≥20 kg) through GLP-1 therapy were matched 1:1 with post-bariatric controls by sex, age (±5 years), and postoperative body mass index (±3 kg/m²). Patients underwent abdominoplasty. Primary outcome was any complication within 90 days. Multivariable analysis assessed the independent effect of treatment modality. Groups were matched for age (GLP-1: 44.1±7.8 vs bariatric: 42.8±7.0 years, p=0.554) and postoperative BMI (29.0±2.4 vs 30.6±4.2 kg/m², p=0.163). Weight loss magnitude was lower in GLP-1 patients (29.9±5.7 vs 47.2±6.0 kg, p<0.001). Superior nutritional status was observed in GLP-1 patients, with higher albumin (4.0±0.3 vs 3.6±0.4 g/dL, p=0.021) and prealbumin levels (23.2±4.1 vs 18.9±2.8 mg/dL, p=0.003). Overall complication rate showed a trend toward lower rates in the GLP-1 cohort (20% vs 40%, odds ratio 0.38, 95% CI 0.09-1.54, p=0.301). In comprehensive multivariable analysis controlling for weight loss magnitude, duration, albumin, and pannus weight, the direction of effect favoring GLP-1 patients remained consistent (adjusted OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.03-15.0, p=0.830). Abdominoplasty following GLP-1-induced massive weight loss demonstrates trends toward favorable safety profiles and patient satisfaction compared to post-bariatric patients, with effects that persist after comprehensive adjustment for potential confounders.

However, the therapeutic effect is controversial. This meta-analysis assesses their effects and safety in overweight/obese children. PubMed, Cochrane, Web of Science, and Embase were searched (2000- April 2024) for RCTs on probiotics/synbiotics in overweight/obese children. Primary outcomes included anthropometric measures, lipid profiles, insulin sensitivity, inflammatory markers, and liver enzymes. Result stability and heterogeneity sources were assessed by sensitivity and subgroup analyses. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on age, intervention time, complications and treatment methods. Review Manager 5.4.1 and STATA 15.0 were used to conduct the statistical analysis. A total of 16 studies were included (n = 763). L. acidophilus is the most commonly used. We found significant reductions in BMI-z, CRP and TNF-α. Synbiotics/probiotics are more effective when the treatment lasted for more than 3 months or when the patients was under 12 years old. All indicators lost significance in patients with NAFLD. Probiotics/synbiotics significantly improved BMI-z, CRP, and TNF-α in overweight/obese children. Patients without complications under the age of 12 or those whose treatment lasts for more than 3 months will gain more benefits. This study found that probiotics/synbiotics could significantly improve BMI-Zscore, CRP, and TNF-α in overweight/obese children. This meta-analysis, incorporating the latest randomized controlled trials (RCTs), identified factors influencing probiotic/synbiotic efficacy through subgroup analysis: probiotic/synbiotic type, treatment duration, patient age, and the presence of complications.

41161570,"Assessment of Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, Alcohol-associated liver disease, and Metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-associated steatotic liver disease in open Mexican population.","The concept of Metabolic dysfunction and alcohol-associated steatotic liver disease (MetALD) is recent. Patients with MetALD may have a higher risk of developing steatosis, inflammation, fibrosis, and cirrhosis than Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) or Alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD) patients. This study aims to evaluate the presence and grade of steatosis and liver fibrosis in the open Mexican population to determine the frequency and stage of MASLD, ALD, and MetALD. Subjects aged 18 years or older, of any gender, and with a body mass index (BMI) of 18.5 or higher, who were healthy and without pre-existing chronic diseases, liver disease, or cancer, and who donated blood to our center's blood bank between June 1, 2021, and March 31, 2022, were included. To estimate the grade of steatosis and liver fibrosis, vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) was performed.

41114974,County-Level Factors and Preventable Premature Liver Mortality in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is an increasingly significant cause of premature liver mortality (PLM) in the US; however, the proportion that is preventable and the upstream factors remain poorly understood. To quantify the burden of preventable MASLD-PLM and identify county-level factors associated with its variation. Ecological, cross-sectional study of publicly available mortality and county-level data from January 2011 to December 2020 for US counties with complete covariate information. MASLD-PLM was defined as liver-related deaths where MASLD was recorded as an underlying or contributing cause, among decedents aged 75 years or younger for males and 80 years or younger for females. Statistical analysis was performed from February 2024 to August 2025. The primary outcome was the proportion of MASLD-PLM considered preventable, calculated by comparing county rates with the mean rate in the 3 states with the lowest mortality; to assess robustness, an alternative benchmark using the 10th percentile of the county-level MASLD-PLM distribution was also applied. Structural equation modeling estimated total, direct, and indirect associations of proportion of preventable MASLD-PLM with county-level factors. Associations are expressed as standardized β coefficients, representing the change in proportion of preventable MASLD-PLM (in SD units) per 1-SD change in each factor. In total, 2704 of 3143 counties with complete covariate information were included (county level composition: mean [SD] age, 41.17 [5.20] years; mean [SD] percentage female, 50.1% [2.3%]). Between 2011 and 2020, the mean annual MASLD-PLM was 18 345 deaths (8.22 per 100 000 population), with 8095 deaths (44.1%) to 10 636 deaths (58.0%) estimated as preventable. The proportion of MASLD-PLM distribution was highly left-skewed, with 2182 counties (80.7%) having a preventable proportion of 70% or greater. Higher proportion of preventable MASLD-PLM occurred more often in rural counties and was associated with higher rates of physical inactivity (β = 0.31; 95% CI, 0.28-0.35), obesity (β = 0.23; 95% CI, 0.18-0.27), preventable hospitalizations (β = 0.15; 95% CI, 0.11-0.18), and diabetes (β = 0.09; 95% CI, 0.04-0.14). These factors were associated with upstream conditions including lower access to exercise-friendly environments, unfavorable food environments, and higher uninsurance rates. Findings were consistent when using an alternative benchmark based on the 10th percentile of county-level mortality rates. In this ecological cross-sectional study of US counties, most MASLD-PLM was preventable, with the highest burdens in rural, socioeconomically disadvantaged, and medically underserved areas.

In their dormant, microscopic state within the liver, these metastatic lesions are undetectable by clinical diagnostic imaging until they form overt, chemoresistant metastases. Therefore, understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying dormancy in colorectal cancer liver metastases is a significant knowledge gap, motivating the engineering of nuanced in vitro models of disease. The current work presents an engineered model of liver-metastatic colorectal cancer dormancy. Decellularized extracellular matrix (dECM) scaffolds are used to provide microscopic colorectal cancer cell clusters with a biomimetic, 3D liver-specific architecture to colonize. Combined with nutrient deprivation and low dose chemotherapy, liver dECM significantly promotes dormancy, which manifests as slowed proliferation, nutrient/chemo-dependent G1/S and ECM-driven G2/M cell cycle arrest, diminished tumorigenicity, and robust chemotherapy resistance. The engineered dormancy signature is reversible, mimicking dormancy escape. The dECM-based model of engineered dormant colorectal cancer liver metastasis is crucial for advancing knowledge of dormancy induction and reversal, to improve therapeutics and patient survival.",2025,Oct,Advanced healthcare materials,Sabrina N VandenHeuvel; Lucia L Nash; Abigail J Clevenger; Claudia A Collier; Oscar R Benavides; Sanjana Roy; Brinlee Goggans; Aelita Salikhova; Anvitha Tharakesh; Svasti Haricharan; Amber N Stratman; Scott Kopetz; Alex J Walsh; Shreya A Raghavan,1391,True,2025-10-01
38447814,Safety and Efficacy of Efruxifermin in Combination With a GLP-1 Receptor Agonist in Patients With NASH/MASH and Type 2 Diabetes in a Randomized Phase 2 Study.,"In phase 2 studies, efruxifermin, an Fc-FGF21 analog, significantly reduced steatohepatitis and fibrosis in patients with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, now called metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), for which there is no approved treatment. Type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity are prevalent among patients with MASH and increasingly treated with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs). This study evaluated the safety and efficacy of efruxifermin in patients with MASH, fibrosis, and T2D taking a GLP-1RA. Cohort D was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2b study in adults with T2D and MASH with fibrosis (F1-F3) on stable GLP-1RA therapy randomized (2:1) to receive efruxifermin 50 mg or placebo, once weekly for 12 weeks. The primary endpoint was safety and tolerability of efruxifermin added to a stable dose of GLP-1RA. Secondary endpoints included changes in hepatic fat fraction (HFF), markers of liver injury and fibrosis, and metabolic parameters. Adults (N = 31) with T2D and MASH fibrosis (F1-F3) on a stable GLP-1RA (semaglutide, 48.4%; dulaglutide, 45.2%; liraglutide, 6.5%) received efruxifermin 50 mg (n = 21) or placebo (n = 10) for 12 weeks. The addition of efruxifermin to a GLP-1RA appeared safe and well-tolerated. The most frequent efruxifermin-related adverse events were mild to moderate gastrointestinal events. One patient receiving efruxifermin discontinued due to nausea, and another withdrew consent. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events. After 12 weeks, efruxifermin reduced HFF by 65% (P < .0001 vs placebo) compared with a 10% reduction for placebo (GLP-1RA alone). Efruxifermin also improved noninvasive markers of liver injury, fibrosis, glucose, and lipid metabolism while maintaining GLP-1RA-mediated weight loss. The tolerability profile of efruxifermin added to GLP-1RA appeared comparable to that of either drug alone, while also significantly reducing HFF and noninvasive markers of fibrosis in patients with MASH and T2D. Liver health in patients already on a GLP-1RA may be further improved by addition of efruxifermin. gov, Number: NCT05039450.",2025,Jan,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,Stephen A Harrison; Juan P Frias; K Jean Lucas; Gary Reiss; Guy Neff; Sureka Bollepalli; Yan Su; Doreen Chan; Erik J Tillman; Ali Moulton; Brittany de Temple; Arian Zari; Reshma Shringarpure; Timothy Rolph; Andrew Cheng; Kitty Yale,2145,True,2025-01-01
41137970,p53 regulates glucose metabolic reprogramming in MASLD-related hepatocellular carcinoma via modulating mitochondrial pyruvate carriers.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is emerging as a leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), yet the molecular mechanisms linking metabolic reprogramming to MASLD-related HCC (MASLD-HCC) remain unclear. This study aimed to elucidate the role of p53 in regulating glucose metabolism via the mitochondrial pyruvate carrier (MPC) axis and its impact on MASLD-HCC progression. A MASLD-HCC mouse model and a high-fat-induced HepG2, Huh7, Hep3B cell model were established. Serum biomarkers, liver histopathology, and tumor characteristics were analyzed. p53 activity and expression was modulated using Nutlin-3, Pifithrin-α (PFT-α), and TP53 overexpression plasmids, while MPC pathway involvement was validated using the MPC inhibitor UK-5099 and MPC1 overexpression plasmids. Techniques included Western blot, qPCR, CCK-8 assays, Oil Red O (ORO) staining, and functional assays for proliferation and migration. During the disease progression from MASLD to HCC, p53 expression is upregulated in vivo and in vitro models, promoting glucose metabolic reprogramming by enhancing glycolysis and suppressing gluconeogenesis. This metabolic shift is mediated through the p53-PUMA axis, which downregulates MPC. Moreover, both pharmacological and genetic modulation of MPC reversed the effects of p53 on glycolysis, lipid accumulation, tumor cell migration, and clonogenic potential. TP53 drives metabolic reprogramming in MASLD-HCC via the PUMA-MPC axis, promoting glycolysis-dependent tumor progression. This challenges the conventional tumor-suppressive role of p53, highlighting its context-dependent pro-tumorigenic function under metabolic stress. Targeting the p53-PUMA-MPC pathway may provide potential targets for precision therapy.",2025,Oct,Hepatology international,Ze Wang; Fei Tian; Yiming Wang; Xiaodong Meng; Qiufang Wang; Liying Cao; Zechao He; Xiangming Ma,1768,True,2025-10-01
41060519,Effects of 6-month treatment with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide on 24-hour energy metabolism and body composition in adults with obesity.,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are effective drugs for weight loss and management of obesity-related comorbidities. Their role in 24-hour energy metabolism remains unclear. This study evaluated the effect of liraglutide treatment on 24-hour energy metabolism and body composition in a real-life clinical setting. This prospective study enrolled 11 patients with obesity (8 females; mean age 49 ± 9 years; weight 103 ± 18 kg) treated with liraglutide for 6 months at clinically titrated doses at the Obesity and Lipodystrophy Center, University Hospital of Pisa. Measurements of 24-hour energy expenditure (24hEE), 24-hour sleeping metabolic rate (24hSMR), and substrate oxidation (carbohydrates, lipids, proteins) were obtained via whole-room indirect calorimetry prior to start the therapy (V1) and after 6 months (V2). Body composition was assessed by Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DXA) at V1 and V2. At V2, participants showed significant weight loss (- 10.5 kg, p < 0.001), primarily driven by a decrease in total fat mass (- 8.7 kg, p < 0.001), with a marked reduction in trunk fat mass (- 5.1 kg, p < 0.001). A modest yet statistically significant reduction in total lean soft tissue was also observed (- 1.7 kg, p = 0.02). No changes in 24hEE and 24hSMR could be detected. Fat oxidation increased (+ 352 kcal/d, p = 0.03), while carbohydrate oxidation decreased (- 422 kcal/d, p = 0.003), and protein oxidation remained stable. Liraglutide induces significant weight loss in patients with obesity, primarily through fat mass reduction, while largely preserving lean soft tissue. These changes are accompanied by a shift toward fat oxidation, without relevant variations in 24hEE.",2025,Oct,Journal of endocrinological investigation,Alessio Basolo; Giordano Paolucci; Paolo Piaggi; Valentina Angeli; Susanna Bechi Genzano; Paola Fierabracci; Edda Vignali; Chiara Bologna; Guido Salvetti; Luca Chiovato; Andrea Natali; Jonathan Krakoff; Alberto Landi; Ferruccio Santini,1714,True,2025-10-01
41098473,Development and implementation of a diagnostic and therapeutic care pathway for type 2 diabetes management in the hospital setting: preliminary findings from an Italian retrospective observational study.,"The 2022-2023 Italian diabetes guidelines emphasize individualized therapy and structured discharge planning for hospitalized patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Despite the associate risks, traditional T2DM treatment regimens often include sulfonylureas and insulin. This study evaluated the impact of the Diagnostic and Therapeutic Care Pathway (PDTA) - a guideline-based program prioritizing GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) and SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), along with structured outpatient follow-up - on glycemic control in non-critically ill hospitalized T2DM patients. This retrospective, observational study included patients with pre-existing or newly diagnosed T2DM hospitalized in non-critical care settings due to acute events. All patients were managed under the PDTA and followed at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months post-discharge. The primary endpoint was the change in HbA1c from hospitalization. Data on prescribed T2DM treatments and hospital readmissions were collected. Among 110 patients (mean age 71.8 ± 10.1 years), 45% were hospitalized due to major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) and 55% due to sepsis or respiratory failure. The mean HbA PDTA implementation resulted in sustained improvements in glycemic control among T2DM patients, supporting the broader adoption of structured, guideline-based care models.

37342259,Comparing the effectiveness of long-term use of daily and weekly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists treatments in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes mellitus: a network meta-analysis.,"In the present network meta-analysis (NMA), we aimed to compare the effectiveness of daily and weekly treatment with glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists for patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). We used Stata 17.0 for the NMA. Eligible Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were searched in PubMed, Cochrane, and Embase databases until December 2022. Two researchers independently screened the available studies. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias in the included studies. We used GRADEprofiler (version3.6) to analyze the evidence certainty. Primary outcomes such as liver fat content (LFC), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels, as well as secondary outcomes such as γ-glutamyltransferase (γGGT) and body weight, were evaluated. Then, each intervention was ranked by the surface under the cumulative ranking curve (SUCRA). As a supplement, we drew forest plots of subgroup using RevMan (version 5.4). Fourteen RCTs involving 1666 participants were included in the present study. The NMA results showed that exenatide (bid) was the best treatment for improving LFC compared with other agents, liraglutide, dulaglutide, semaglutide (qw) and placebo), and the SUCRA values were 66.8%. Among five interventions (except exenatide (bid) and semaglutide (qw)) evaluated for AST outcome, and six interventions (except exenatide (bid)) evaluated for ALT outcome, semaglutide (qd) was the most effective drug (SUCRA (AST) = 100%, SUCRA (ALT) = 95.6%). The result of LFC in daily group was MD = -3.66, 95% CI [-5.56, -1.76] and in weekly GLP-1RAs group, it was MD = -3.51, 95% CI [-4, -3.02]. As to AST and ALT, the results in daily group versus weekly group were AST: MD = -7.45, 95% CI [-14.57, -0.32] versus MD= -0.58, 95% CI [-3.18, 2.01] and ALT: MD = -11.12, 95% CI [-24.18, 1.95] versus MD = -5.62, 95% CI [-15.25, 4]. The quality of evidence was assessed as moderate or low. The daily GLP-1RAs may be more effective in primary outcomes. And the daily semaglutide may be the most effective treatment for NAFLD and T2DM among the six interventions.",2023,01,Frontiers in endocrinology,Xia Yuan; Zhe Gao; Caixuan Yang; Kaixin Duan; Luping Ren; Guangyao Song,2175,True,2023-01-01
41026089,GLP-1 Receptor Agonists for Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) are incretin-based therapies with demonstrated efficacy in glycemic control, weight reduction, and cardiovascular and renal protection. Although data in kidney transplant recipients (KTR) remain limited, the high prevalences of overweight and obesity, post-transplant diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease in this population make GLP-1RAs a promising therapeutic strategy. This narrative review outlines the rationale for their use in KTRs, drawing from recent trials in non-transplant populations and emerging real-world evidence in KTR. We summarize key clinical considerations, including patient selection, dose escalation, and monitoring strategies, as well as existing retrospective and prospective studies examining safety and efficacy in the post-transplant setting. Available data suggest that GLP-1RAs are generally well tolerated, without clear evidence of increased risk for graft rejection, acute pancreatitis, or interaction with immunosuppressive agents. However, gastrointestinal side effects and early discontinuation remain common, emphasizing the need for tailored counseling and dose titration. Importantly, the current evidence is constrained by small sample sizes, short follow-up, and potential selection bias; these limitations lessen the certainty of safety and effectiveness estimates. Translational inferences from non-transplant trials (e.g., SELECT, FLOW, SMART) should also be made cautiously. Future studies should investigate long-term graft outcomes, changes in body composition, and optimal integration with immunosuppressive regimens. A clear research agenda prioritizing graft survival, cardiovascular and kidney outcomes, quality of life, cost-effectiveness, and patient-reported outcomes-ideally via randomized, multicenter or registry-based pragmatic designs-will be critical. As GLP-1RAs become increasingly accessible and clinically relevant, a multidisciplinary and patient-centered approach is essential to guide their safe and effective use in KTRs.

41043692,Selective Agonism of Liver and Gut FXR Prevents Cholestasis and Intestinal Atrophy in Parenterally Fed Neonatal Pigs.,"We aimed to investigate the relative efficacy of feeding different bile acids in preventing PNALD in neonatal pigs. Newborn pigs given total parenteral nutrition (TPN) combined with minimal enteral feeding of chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA), or increasing doses of obeticholic acid (OCA) for 19 days. Enteral OCA (5 and 15 mg/kg), but not CDCA (30 mg/kg) reduced blood cholestasis markers compared to TPN controls and increased bile acids in the gallbladder and intestine. Major bile acids in the liver and distal intestine were CDCA, HCA, HDCA and OCA, and their relative proportions were increased by the type of bile acid (CDCA or OCA) given enterally. High doses of OCA increased the total NR1H4-agonistic bile acid profile in the liver and intestine above 50% total bile acids. Both CDCA and OCA treatments suppressed hepatic cyp7a1 expression, but only OCA increased hepatobiliary transporters, ABCB11, ABCC4 and ABCB1. Plasma phytosterol levels were reduced and biliary levels were increased by CDCA and OCA and hepatic sterol transporters, abcg5/8, expression were increased by OCA. Both CDCA and OCA increased plasma FGF19 and OCA increased intestinal FGF19, FABP6, and SLC51A. Both CDCA and OCA increased intestinal mucosal growth, whereas CDCA increased the plasma GLP-2, GLP-1 and GIP. Enteral OCA prevented cholestasis and phytosterolemia by increased hepatic bile acid and sterol transport via induction of hepatobiliary transporter NR1H4 target genes and not by suppression of bile acid synthesis genes. We also showed an intestinal trophic action of OCA that demonstrates a dual clinical benefit of NR1H4 agonism in the prevention of PNALD in pigs.",2025,Oct,Journal of lipid research,Yanjun Jiang; Zhengfeng Fang; Gregory Guthrie; Barbara Stoll; Shaji Chacko; Sen Lin; Bolette Hartmann; Jens J Holst; Harry Dawson; Jose J Pastor; Ignacio R Ipharraguerre; Douglas G Burrin,1662,True,2025-10-01
41144868,Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in pediatric metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the leading chronic liver disease in children. Treatment with glucagon-like-peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) have shown resolution of steatohepatitis with improvement in fibrosis in adults, yet pediatric studies are extremely limited. This study evaluates the impact of GLP-1RAs on pediatric MASLD, using alanine aminotransferase (ALT) reduction as a marker of improved disease activity. We conducted a single-center retrospective study in patients ≤18 years old with a diagnosis of MASLD, who were prescribed a GLP-1RA from January 2, 2018 and January 10, 2024 at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Data were collected at baseline, 6 months, and at end-of-treatment (EOT). Inclusion required MASLD diagnosis per new criteria, elevated baseline ALT, and paired ALT values at baseline and EOT. Forty-two patients met inclusion criteria (mean age 15 years, 64% male, 55% White). ALT improved by a mean of 56 U/L at 6 months (p = 0.04), and by 37 U/L at EOT (p = 0.004). Patients prescribed a GLP-1RA for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) had greater reductions in ALT compared to those treated for obesity. Improvements were also observed in aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C), and triglycerides. Body mass index (BMI) percentile and z-score showed no significant changes, but BMI stabilization was observed. This is the largest pediatric study on GLP-1RAs in MASLD to date. On a GLP-1RA, ALT significantly improved at 6 months and EOT, suggesting their role in improving disease activity. This should thus be considered as an adjunct to lifestyle modification in treating pediatric MASLD.",2025,Oct,Journal of pediatric gastroenterology and nutrition,Andrea M Tou; Jennifer Panganiban,1730,True,2025-10-01
39029595,"Gut microbes, diet, and genetics as drivers of metabolic liver disease: a narrative review outlining implications for precision medicine.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is rapidly increasing in prevalence, impacting over a third of the global population. The advanced form of MASLD, Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), is on track to become the number one indication for liver transplant. FDA-approved pharmacological agents are limited for MASH, despite over 400 ongoing clinical trials, with only a single drug (resmetirom) currently on the market. This is likely due to the heterogeneous nature of disease pathophysiology, which involves interactions between highly individualized genetic and environmental factors. To apply precision medicine approaches that overcome interpersonal variability, in-depth insights into interactions between genetics, nutrition, and the gut microbiome are needed, given that each have emerged as dynamic contributors to MASLD and MASH pathogenesis. Here, we discuss the associations and molecular underpinnings of several of these factors individually and outline their interactions in the context of both patient-based studies and preclinical animal model systems. Finally, we highlight gaps in knowledge that will require further investigation to aid in successfully implementing precision medicine to prevent and alleviate MASLD and MASH.",2024,Nov,The Journal of nutritional biochemistry,Jake B Hermanson; Samar A Tolba; Evan A Chrisler; Vanessa A Leone,1294,True,2024-11-01
41113904,Proteome Profiling Identifies CDH2 as a Potential Screening Marker for NAFLD and Liver Fibrosis in the Snoring Population.,"Snoring individuals, particularly those with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), exhibit a higher prevalence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver fibrosis. The objectives of this study were to explore potential screening biomarkers for NAFLD and liver fibrosis in the snoring population. The research was carried out as a cross-sectional study at the Sleep Center of the First Affiliated Hospital of Fujian Medical University. All patients underwent FibroScan and overnight polysomnography (PSG). The 96-metabolism related proteins were detected using liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (Oink Proteomics). A total of 59 NAFLD were found among the 87 snoring patients. A total of 12 proteins with differential expression levels were identified between non-NAFLD group and NAFLD group via Oink Proteomics. The correlation analysis revealed a close correlation between Cadherin 2 (CDH2) and NAFLD, liver fibrosis (with correlation coefficients of 0.394 and 0.383, respectively, both P < 0.05). The risk of NAFLD and liver fibrosis was much higher in snorers with higher levels of CHD2 compared with snorers with lower levels of CHD2 (both P < 0.05). A combination of CHD2, age, BMI, glucose, AHI and waistline presented the acceptable AUC for the detection of NAFLD and liver fibrosis in snoring patients (0.92, 95% CI: 0.86-0.98 and 0.81, 95% CI: 0.72-0.91, respectively, both p < 0.001). In snoring patients, higher level of CDH2 was identified as a risk factor for NAFLD and liver fibrosis; a combination of CDH2, age, BMI, glucose, AHI and waistline could act as a convenient and effective indicator for screening NAFLD and liver fibrosis. Future research should expand the sample size and conduct multicenter validation to further explore the value of CDH2. Snoring individuals have an elevated incidence of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and liver fibrosis. Oink Proteomics discovered that CDH2 expression was upregulated in individuals with snoring who also have NAFLD. Further analysis revealed that a combination of CDH2, age, Body mass index (BMI), glucose, Apnea hypopnea index (AHI) and waistline could act as a convenient and effective indicator for screening NAFLD and liver fibrosis in snoring patients.",2025,01,Nature and science of sleep,Shiyuan Huang; Xiaoyu Deng; Jia Chen; Jiefeng Huang; Hansheng Xie; Biying Wang; Ningfang Lian,2259,True,2025-01-01
39513734,Management strategies for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD).,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is characterized by hepatic steatosis that is confirmed by imaging or histology in the setting of at least 1 metabolic risk factor in the absence of significant alcohol consumption. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH, was recently renamed metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH); it represents the progressive form of MASLD. MASH is defined by hepatic steatosis, lobular inflammation, and ballooning degeneration (hepatocellular injury) in a characteristic histologic pattern. Multiple pathophysiologic mechanisms underlie the development of MASLD, and multiple factors (eg, metabolic, hormonal, genetic, nutritional, and epigenetic components) are related to liver injury. MASH has a prevalence in the United States of 1% to 6%, and it is expected to rise in the next decade. Individuals living with MASH frequently suffer from comorbidities such as type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Several guidelines have been published to support the timely diagnosis of MASH that incorporate noninvasive tests that obviate the need for liver biopsy. Multiple MASH treatment options are in various stages of development. The THR-β agonist resmetirom, approved by FDA in March 2024, offers a liver-directed treatment for those patients living with moderate to severe fibrosis without cirrhosis. Considering the progressive nature of the disease and the availability of a treatment that can be initiated early to halt MASH progression, patients who have risk factors for MASH should urgently be encouraged to visit their health care providers for MASH screening.",2024,Nov,The American journal of managed care,Naim Alkhouri; Mazen Noureddin,1643,True,2024-11-01

This meta-analysis aimed to quantify the associations among MAFLD, MASLD, and long-term clinical outcomes. A comprehensive literature search was performed to identify cohort studies that assessed the association of MASLD and MAFLD with all-cause mortality, cause-specific (cardiovascular and cancer-related) mortality, and the incidence of cardiovascular disease in the PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and CENTRAL databases from inception through October 31, 2024. Pooled hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for relevant outcomes. We identified 18 cohort studies, comprising 10,653,666 patients with MAFLD from 13 studies and 3,202,447 patients with MASLD from nine studies. MAFLD was significantly associated with an increased risk of overall mortality (pooled HR [95% confidence interval], 1.30 [1.16 to 1.47]) and cardiovascular mortality (1.31 [1.08 to 1.60]; both p<0.01), but not with cancer-related mortality (1.10 [0.97 to 1.24]; p=0.130). Conversely, MASLD was associated with a higher risk for all mortality outcomes: overall mortality (1.34 [1.12 to 1.61]), cardiovascular mortality (1.17 [1.07 to 1.27]), and cancer-related mortality (1.24 [1.19 to 1.29]; all p<0.01). The risk of cardiovascular disease was increased in patients with both MAFLD (1.48 [1.31 to 1.66]) and MASLD (1.33 [1.21 to 1.46]; both p<0.001). MAFLD and MASLD were both associated with increased risks of mortality and cardiovascular outcomes.

38511418,The role of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.,"Despite its considerable and growing burden, there are currently no Food and Drug Administration-approved treatments for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease or its progressive form, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Several glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and other agents are in various phases of clinical development for use in MASH; an ideal therapy should reduce liver fat content, improve chronic liver disease, help mitigate metabolic comorbidities and decrease all-cause mortality. Because of interconnected disease mechanisms, metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease/MASH often coexists with type 2 diabetes (T2D), obesity and cardiovascular disease. Various GLP-1RAs are Food and Drug Administration-approved for use in T2D, and two, liraglutide and semaglutide, are approved for overweight and obesity. GLP-1RAs decrease glucose levels and body weight and improve cardiovascular outcomes in people with T2D who are at high risk of cardiovascular disease. In addition, GLP-1RAs have been reported to reduce liver fat content and liver enzymes, reduce oxidative stress and improve hepatic de novo lipogenesis and the histopathology of MASH. Weight loss may contribute to these effects; however, the exact mechanisms are unknown. Adverse events that are commonly associated with GLP-1RAs include vomiting, nausea and diarrhoea. There is a lack of evidence from meta-analyses regarding the increased risk of acute pancreatitis and various forms of cancer with GLP-1RAs. Large-scale, phase 3 trials, which will provide definitive data on GLP-1RAs and other potential therapies in MASH, are ongoing. Given the spectrum of modalities under investigation, it is hoped that these trials will support the identification of pharmacotherapies that provide clinical benefit for patients with MASH.",2024,Jun,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Manal F Abdelmalek; Stephen A Harrison; Arun J Sanyal,1877,True,2024-06-01
41161609,CAT1 modulates hepatic fibrosis via IL-6-mediated inflammatory and fibrogenic pathways in hepatic stellate cells.,"Hepatic fibrosis is characterized by excessive extracellular matrix deposition and chronic inflammation, primarily driven by the activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). The cationic amino acid transporter 1 (CAT1) has been identified as a key regulator of HSCs activation and fibrosis progression, but its interaction with inflammatory pathways remains unclear. This study investigated the role of CAT1 in hepatic fibrosis and its regulatory effect on interleukin-6 (IL-6)-mediated inflammatory and fibrogenic responses. Bioinformatic analysis of published single-cell RNA sequencing data revealed that CAT1 expression was significantly upregulated in activated HSCs and positively correlated with IL-6 levels. Functional assays demonstrated that IL-6 promotes HSCs proliferation, migration, inflammation, and fibrotic marker expression and inhibited apoptosis, while CAT1 knockdown attenuated these effects. IL-6 overexpression reversed the inhibitory effects of CAT1 knockdown on HSCs activation by regulating JAK2/STAT3 signaling pathway, suggesting that IL-6 acts downstream of CAT1 in promoting fibrosis. In vivo, CAT1 knockdown mitigated liver injury, reduced collagen deposition, and suppressed inflammation in both carbon tetrachloride (CCl₄)-induced hepatic fibrosis and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) models.

41136718,Artificial Intelligence in Population-Level Gastroenterology and Hepatology: A Comprehensive Review of Public Health Applications and Quantitative Impact.,"Artificial intelligence (AI), which includes machine learning and deep learning, is fundamentally changing public health in gastroenterology and hepatology-fields grappling with a significant global disease burden. This review focuses on the population-level applications and impact of AI, highlighting its role in shifting healthcare strategies from reactive treatment to proactive prevention. AI demonstrates substantial improvements across many different areas. In colorectal cancer, AI models significantly boost detection rates, successfully identifying a large majority of high-risk individuals often missed by traditional screening methods. For metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), advanced non-invasive tests offer a high degree of reliability in detecting liver fibrosis. The identification of viral hepatitis is enhanced with excellent accuracy, and gastrointestinal infection surveillance benefits from wastewater analysis that provides an early warning system weeks ahead of clinical case reporting. Furthermore, AI improves the diagnosis of upper GI cancers, such as gastric cancer, with higher diagnostic capability, and facilitates precision public health in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) through highly accurate risk prediction models. Despite these important advances, significant hurdles remain. Key challenges include ensuring diverse and representative data to prevent algorithmic bias, protecting patient privacy, establishing robust regulatory frameworks for new technologies, and successfully moving innovations from research settings into practical, real-world deployment. The unequal distribution of AI development and access between high-income countries and low- and middle-income countries risks exacerbating existing health disparities. To fully realize AI's transformative potential for global public health in gastroenterology and hepatology, these cross-cutting issues must be actively addressed through ethical design, rigorous validation, and equitable worldwide deployment.",2025,Oct,Digestive diseases and sciences,Hareesha Rishab Bharadwaj; Dushyant Singh Dahiya; Priyal Dalal; Muhtasim Fuad; Hafiz Ali Raza; Muhammad Ibrahim; Arkadeep Dhali; Fariha Hasan; Balamrit Singh Sokhal; Karan Yagnik; Bhanu Siva Mohan Pinnam; Farhan Gohar; Hassam Ali,2041,True,2025-10-01

41054685,"Medical vs. Surgical Obesity Management: A Narrative Review of Efficacy, Safety, and Long-Term Outcomes.","Obesity is a chronic, relapsing, and multifactorial disease with rising prevalence and substantial health and economic burdens. Despite significant advances in both medical and surgical treatments, clinicians and patients still face a lack of clear, comparative guidance for tailoring therapy based on individual risk factors, disease severity, and comorbidities. This review synthesizes current evidence on lifestyle and behavioral interventions, pharmacologic therapies (including glucagon-like peptide-1 [GLP-1] receptor agonists), and surgical approaches. Key clinical considerations in treatment selection include body mass index, eligibility for surgical or non-surgical interventions, patient preferences, tolerance for side effects, and the long-term impact on quality of life. While lifestyle and behavioral modifications alone pose minimal risks, they are considerably less effective than when combined with pharmacologic or surgical/endoscopic treatments. Current pharmacotherapies, particularly GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual agonists such as tirzepatide, represent a paradigm shift in non-surgical weight management, though questions remain regarding their long-term efficacy and safety. Bariatric surgery offers the most effective and durable weight loss outcomes, significantly improving obesity-related comorbidities and long-term survival. However, it carries higher upfront risks, potential complications, nutritional deficiencies, and increased costs. Ultimately, integrated treatment models that combine lifestyle, pharmacologic, and/or surgical strategies are likely to offer the most effective and sustainable outcomes in managing obesity. Our review highlights the importance of an individualized, evidence-based, and multimodal strategy to effectively manage obesity and address its complexity. Continued research is essential to refine patient selection and improve integration of treatment options, ultimately supporting more personalized and effective obesity care.",2025,Sep,Cureus,Joyce Akwe; Kimela Fongeh; Sarah Jung; Mary Ann Kirkconnell Hall; Viniya Patidar; Yoo Mee Shin,1995,True,2025-09-01

41133230,Comparative effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual agonists in the treatment of patients with metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) and dual agonists have been shown to induce histological improvements in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). However, current clinical evidence on their effectiveness in improving hepatic fibrosis and cardiovascular outcomes remains limited and inconsistent. This study synthesized randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from major databases up to August 30, 2025, focusing on patients with biopsy-confirmed MASH. Pooled mean differences were calculated using either a fixed-effects or random-effects model, depending on the degree of heterogeneity observed among the studies. Six studies including 1,726 participants were analyzed. Compared with placebo, GLP-1RAs and dual agonists significantly increased the likelihood of histological improvement in MASH without worsening hepatic fibrosis. (OR: 4.51, 95% CI: 3.68 to 5.52). It was associated with a ≥1-stage improvement in hepatic fibrosis without worsening MASH (OR: 1.78; 95% CI: 1.47to2.16). In addition, it contributed to MASH resolution accompanied by a ≥1-stage improvement in hepatic fibrosis (OR: 7.42; 95% CI: 2.98to18.48). In subgroup analyses based on post-treatment weight loss, GLP-1RAs and dual agonists demonstrated significant efficacy in promoting hepatic fibrosis resolution without worsening MASH among patients achieving a ≥10% weight loss (OR: 9.59; 95% CI: 4.01to15.18). However, in patients with <10% weight loss, GLP-1RAs and dual agonists did not demonstrate significant differences (OR: 1.30; 95% CI: 0.92to1.83). Moreover, GLP-1RAs and dual agonists achieved a significant pooled reduction in cardiovascular parameters, including total cholesterol (WMD: -4.15 mmol/L; 95% CI: -13.13 to 4.82) and triglycerides (WMD: -17.70 mmol/L; 95% CI: -21.95 to -13.44). Nevertheless, no significant improvement was observed in Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (WMD: -0.67 mmol/L; 95% CI: -6.55 to 5.21). In patients with MASH who achieve a ≥10% weight loss, GLP-1RAs and dual agonists are associated with significant improvements in hepatic fibrosis, whereas their effect is limited in those with <10% weight loss. However, a significant reduction in LDL-C was observed only among patients achieving substantial (≥10%) weight loss. This finding suggests that for patients requiring comprehensive cardiovascular risk management, additional lipid-lowering strategies may be needed to optimize the effectiveness of the intervention. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/, identifier CRD42025640318.",2025,01,Frontiers in endocrinology,Meng Li; Jianli Hu; Yip Han Chin; Han Shi Jocelyn Chew; Wenru Wang,2567,True,2025-01-01

Early identification of individuals at risk for progression to liver cirrhosis is crucial to the mitigation of the disease effects. This review aims to summarize the current evidence on clinical factors predicting MASLD progression to cirrhosis. A comprehensive literature search was conducted in PubMed, Cochrane, Medscape, JAMA, and Scopus covering studies from May 30, 2010, to May 30, 2025. Keywords included NAFLD, NASH, MASH, cirrhosis, risk factors, fibrosis, and progression. Key predictors identified include metabolic syndrome components (obesity, diabetes, and dyslipidemia), genetic variants such as Patatin-like phospholipase domain-containing protein 3 (PNPLA3), transmembrane 6-superfamily member 2 (TM6SF2), Ras-related protein 14 family (RAB14), lifestyle factors (sedentary behavior, high-fructose diet), demographic traits (age, sex, and ethnicity), and histological markers (fibrosis stage, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) features). Non-invasive detection tools such as the Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) fibrosis score (NFS), enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF), and perilipin-2 (PLIN2) and elastography are valuable tests for early identification.

39857719,"Integrated Management of Cardiovascular-Renal-Hepatic-Metabolic Syndrome: Expanding Roles of SGLT2is, GLP-1RAs, and GIP/GLP-1RAs.","Cardiovascular-Kidney-Metabolic syndrome, introduced by the American Heart Association in 2023, represents a complex and interconnected spectrum of diseases driven by shared pathophysiological mechanisms. However, this framework notably excludes the liver-an organ fundamental to metabolic regulation. Building on this concept, Cardiovascular-Renal-Hepatic-Metabolic (CRHM) syndrome incorporates the liver's pivotal role in this interconnected disease spectrum, particularly through its involvement via metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). Despite the increasing prevalence of CRHM syndrome, unified management strategies remain insufficiently explored. This review addresses the following critical question: How can novel anti-diabetic agents, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2is), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), and dual gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1RA, offer an integrated approach to managing CRHM syndrome beyond the boundaries of traditional specialties? By synthesizing evidence from landmark clinical trials, we highlight the paradigm-shifting potential of these therapies. SGLT2is, such as dapagliflozin and empagliflozin, have emerged as cornerstone guideline-directed treatments for heart failure (HF) and chronic kidney disease (CKD), providing benefits that extend beyond glycemic control and are independent of diabetes status. GLP-1RAs, e.g., semaglutide, have transformed obesity management by enabling weight reductions exceeding 15% and improving outcomes in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), diabetic CKD, HF, and MASLD. Additionally, tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1RA, enables unprecedented weight loss (>20%), reduces diabetes risk by over 90%, and improves outcomes in HF with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF), MASLD, and obstructive sleep apnea. By moving beyond the traditional organ-specific approach, we propose a unified framework that integrates these agents into holistic management strategies for CRHM syndrome. This paradigm shift moves away from fragmented, organ-centric management toward a more unified approach, fostering collaboration across specialties and marking progress in precision cardiometabolic medicine.",2025,Jan,Biomedicines,Nikolaos Theodorakis; Maria Nikolaou,2255,True,2025-01-01

Noninvasive criteria have been proposed for initiating treatment; however, these have not been validated in clinical practice. We validated the proposed criteria and established new guidelines for initiating resmetirom treatment in clinical practice. This was a cross-sectional study of 1281 MASLD patients from the HEPAmet registry with biopsy, comorbidity assessment, analytical profile, and elastography. Identification of MASLD with F2 and F3 was the main endpoint. A comprehensive review of international guidelines and expert consensus up to November 2024, focusing on therapeutic indications, was conducted. A total of 38% (n = 486 of 1281) of patients were diagnosed with MASLD F2 and F3 based on biopsy. However, only 39% and 56% of them met treatment eligibility criteria according to the Expert Panel Criteria and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidance, respectively. They included 45% of patients with early-stage fibrosis. False positive and false negative rates ranged from 23% to 41% and 44% to 60%, respectively, with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values below 0.60.These findings were validated in an external cohort.

We aimed to validate and re-optimize known NITs, and most importantly to develop new machine learning (ML)-based NITs to accurately detect MASH F2-F3. Clinical and metabolomic data were collected from 443 patients across three countries and two clinic types (metabolic surgery, gastroenterology/hepatology) covering the entire spectrum of biopsy-proven MASH, including cirrhosis and healthy controls. Three novel types of ML models were developed using a categorical gradient boosting machine pipeline under a classic 4:1 split and a secondary independent validation analysis. These were compared with twenty-three biomarker, imaging, and algorithm-based NITs with both known and re-optimized cutoffs for MASH F2-F3. The NAFLD (Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease) Fibrosis Score (NFS) at a - 1.455 cutoff attained an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.59, the highest sensitivity (90.9 %), and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 87.2 %. FIB-4 risk stratification followed by elastography (8 kPa) had the best specificity (86.9 %) and positive predictive value (PPV) (63.3 %), with an AUC of 0.57. NFS followed by elastography improved the PPV to 65.3 % and AUC to 0.62. Re-optimized FibroScan-AST (FAST) at a 0.22 cutoff had the highest PPV (69.1 %). ML models using aminotransferases, metabolic syndrome components, BMI, and 3-ureidopropionate achieved an AUC of 0.89, which further increased to 0.91 following hyperparameter optimization and the addition of alpha-ketoglutarate. These new ML models outperformed all other NITs and displayed accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV up to 91.2 %, 85.3 %, 97.0 %, 92.4 %, and 90.7 % respectively. The models were reproduced and validated in a secondary sensitivity analysis, that used one of the cohorts as feature selection/training, and the rest as independent validation, likewise outperforming all other applicable NITs. We report for the first time the diagnostic characteristics of non-invasive, metabolomics-based biomarker models to detect MASH with fibrosis F2-F3 required for Resmetirom treatment and inclusion in ongoing phase-III trials.

41158122,Dietary supplementation with a designer metabolic modulator improves MASLD and associated anxiety in mice.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), is a multifaceted condition characterized by excessive liver fat accumulation associated with obesity or other risk factors. Patients with obesity-related MASLD often suffer from comorbid psychiatric conditions, including anxiety. The therapeutic approach for MASLD relies on weight management through dietary and behavioral modifications. Nutritional interventions with essential amino acids (EAAs) have emerged as safe and promising tools in treating metabolic disorders and liver diseases. This study aimed to investigate the effects of dietary supplementation with α5, a designer EAA-based metabolic modulator enriched with tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates, in a murine model of diet-induced MASLD with associated anxiety. Ten-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were fed for 17 weeks either a high-fat, high-sugar diet or a standard purified diet. The α5 compound (1.5 mg/g/day in drinking water) was administered to half of the mice fed each diet (n = 8/group). Mice body weight and energy intake were recorded. Liver and adipose tissue depot weights were calculated as ratios to body weight. Blood analytes were evaluated. Liver samples were analyzed for the enzymatic activity of mitochondrial chain respiratory complexes, gene expression (reverse transcription-qPCR), and histological features (hematoxylin-eosin and Masson's trichrome staining). Liver disease severity was graded using the NAFLD Activity Score. The open field behavioral test was conducted to assess anxiety. Mice fed the high-fat, high-sugar diet developed obesity, a MASLD phenotype, and anxiety-like behaviors. Dietary supplementation with α5 ameliorated liver pathology, including reduced hepatocellular ballooning, fat lipid droplet diameter, and the expression of genes related to fibrosis, without affecting body weight.

40889707,Alterations in one-carbon metabolism in metabolic dysfunction associated steatotic liver disease may be modified by semaglutide.,"Disruptions in one-carbon metabolism (OCM) have been linked to cardiometabolic diseases. We evaluated alterations in OCM metabolites and enzymes and the impact of semaglutide in MASLD. Using targeted metabolomics and bulk-transcriptomics, we analyzed components of OCM in plasma samples and liver biopsies from MASLD patients (n = 100 with F0-F4 fibrosis, 51 % type 2 diabetes) and healthy controls (n = 50). Untargeted metabolomics and transcriptomics were used to analyze plasma and liver specimens from mice with diet-induced obesity and steatohepatitis (DIO-MASH) treated with vehicle or semaglutide compared with chow for 12 weeks. In patients with MASLD vs healthy controls, changes in the concentrations of folate and pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (vitamin B6), betaine, serine, and glycine suggested alteration to the activity of the transsulfuration pathway as well as the methionine and folate cycles. Increased concentrations of metabolites related to enhanced homocysteine conversion and elevated glutamate were also observed. These findings were supported by corresponding alterations in the activity of key enzymes. Similar patterns were identified in comparisons of patients with significant vs no/mild fibrosis and in DIO-MASH mice vs chow. Treatment with semaglutide led to reductions in body weight, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis and largely reversed the metabolic and gene expression changes observed in DIO-MASH mice. MASLD may be linked to alterations in key metabolites and enzymes involved in OCM. The changes in humans were replicated in a MASLD mouse model, and reversal was found after treatment with semaglutide.",2025,Aug,Annals of hepatology,Mikkel Parsberg Werge; Adrian McCann; Elias Badal Rashu; Shi Min Lam; Liv Eline Hetland; Mira Thing; Puria Nabilou; Anders Ellekaer Junker; Jenny Norlin; Sanne Veidal; Dorte Holst; Anne Bugge; Birgitte Martine Viuff; Henning Hvid; Kristian M Bendtsen; Gianluca Mazzoni; Lea Moerch Harder; Mogens Vyberg; Reza Serizawa; Flemming Bendtsen; Per Magne Ueland; Elisabeth Douglas Galsgaard; Nicolai J Wewer Albrechtsen; Lise Lotte Gluud,1638,True,2025-08-01

Given the shared metabolic risk between NAFLD and acute coronary syndrome (ACS), this study aimed to evaluate the association between FIB-4 and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with ACS, in comparison with conventional risk scores. This is an observational cohort study included 941 patients hospitalized with ACS between 2017 and 2021. Patients were classified into three FIB-4 categories: low, < 1.45; intermediate, 1.45-3.25; and high, ≥ 3.25. Clinical, laboratory, angiographic, and echocardiographic data were collected. MACE incidence was evaluated over a median follow-up of 67.5 months. Cox regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analyses were performed. MACE occurred in 37.9% of patients in the high FIB-4 group, compared to 28.7% and 29.2% in the low and intermediate groups, respectively ( The FIB-4 index is a robust, accessible predictor of adverse cardiovascular outcomes in ACS and may enhance conventional risk stratification strategies by integrating systemic metabolic burden into cardiovascular risk assessment.",2025,Sep,Postepy w kardiologii interwencyjnej = Advances in interventional cardiology,Dogac Oksen; Muhammed H Gecit; Zubeyir Bulat; Mehmet E Gokce; Mehmet E Bilgin; Sahra Balcioglu; Sukru Arslan; Veysel Oktay,1281,True,2025-09-01

Herein, a dual-targeting drug delivery system is designed to regulate these metabolic disorders by alleviating aberrant fat accumulation and anti-inflammation. Specifically, polymetformin (P) and resveratrol (R), two therapeutic agents that show preferable antiadiposity effect, are co-loaded in macrophage-disguised and apolipoprotein A-I (apoA-I)-decorated liposome (aML/R&P). Mechanistically, P and R can upregulate uncoupling protein 1 (UCP1) expression to promote AT browning and enhance hepatocyte autophagy to ameliorate hepatic steatosis and inflammation. Meanwhile, the dual modification of macrophage membrane and apoA-I largely improves its targeting efficiency toward liver and AT. In mouse models of obesity and MASLD, aML/R&P effectively reduces body weight, restores metabolic homeostasis, enhances liver parameters, and improves insulin sensitivity, demonstrating great promise in treating obesity and obesity-associated metabolic disorders.",2025,Oct,Nano letters,Qiaqia Xiao; Chuying Wang; Jing Yang; Xueyu Gao; Zhaoan Chen; Zheming Niu; Yi Hou; Cong Fu; Ziwei Yan; Guangda Zhu; Hening Liu; Yue Yin; Jing Shang; Wei Wang; Lu Tang,1196,True,2025-10-01
41127682,Intracranial electrophysiological biomarkers of compulsivity in obsessive-compulsive disorder.,"There is an emerging need for objective neural biomarkers of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) to improve the efficacy of neuromodulatory interventions, most notably deep-brain stimulation (DBS), and develop closed-loop stimulation paradigms. Preliminary data suggest that such biomarkers may be derived from local field potentials (LFPs) recorded in individual patients implanted with sensing DBS devices. However, reliable LFP signatures that are generalizable across OCD patients have yet to be identified. Here, we relate LFPs recorded from sensing DBS electrodes in different basal-ganglia structures to core symptoms of OCD in 11 patients during personalized provocation of obsessions and compulsions. We identify two general markers of compulsion: delta and alpha LFP power was significantly increased during all compulsions in the external globus pallidus (GPe), nucleus accumbens, anterior limb of the internal capsule (ALIC) and anterior lateral anterior commissure. In mental compulsion subtypes, similar low-frequency increases were observed only in GPe (delta/alpha) and ALIC (alpha), suggesting that these signals possibly reflect more universal biomarkers of compulsivity unconfounded by motor function. GPe delta power correlated with OCD symptom severity, establishing a meaningful connection between subcortical sensing DBS readout and patient experience. ALIC alpha power was modulated by the phase of theta oscillations during compulsions, possibly reflecting pathological coupling of cortical networks in OCD. Our results demonstrate unique, group-level LFP correlates of core OCD symptoms across disease-relevant basal-ganglia structures. These electrophysiological signatures help pave the way toward the development of biomarker-targeted neuro-modulatory intervention for OCD. Netherlands Trial Register ID: NL7486.",2025,Jul,Nature.

41114583,Microbial changes resulting from VSG attenuate MASLD by modulating bile acid metabolism and the intestinal FXR-FGF19 axis.,"Vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) is a highly effective intervention for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and is associated with significant alterations in the gut microbiota. However, the precise mechanisms underlying its metabolic benefits remain poorly understood. In this study, we revealed that VSG mitigates MASLD by reshaping gut microbiota-mediated bile acid metabolism. Through integrated 16S rRNA sequencing, targeted metabolomics, and functional validation experiments, we demonstrated that VSG markedly enhances bile salt hydrolase (BSH) activity within the gut microbiota, resulting in elevated levels of unconjugated bile acids. These unconjugated bile acids serve as potent agonists for the intestinal farnesoid X receptor (FXR), thereby activating the intestinal FXR-fibroblast growth factor 19 signaling pathway. This activation leads to significant improvements in metabolic health, including enhanced glucose regulation and attenuated hepatic lipid accumulation. Fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) from VSG-treated rats replicated these metabolic improvements, whereas antibiotic treatment abolished these beneficial effects, highlighting the indispensable role of the gut microbiota in mediating the anti-MASLD effects of VSG. Importantly, inhibition of intestinal FXR signaling negated the metabolic benefits of FMT, further emphasizing the critical role of the gut microbiota-BSH-FXR axis. Our findings reveal a novel mechanism by which VSG alleviates MASLD through gut microbiota-dependent activation of intestinal FXR, offering new perspectives for microbiome-targeted therapeutic strategies in MASLD. Fecal transplantation from bariatric surgery patients and mice to germ-free mice has shown that the gut microbiota may contribute to metabolic benefits after bariatric surgery. However, the mechanisms by which the gut microbiota contributes to metabolic benefits after bariatric surgery require further investigation. To address this gap, we investigated the effects of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy (VSG) gut microbiota on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)",2025,Oct,mSystems,Yi Xia; Jinpu Yang; Shixian Lu; Weixin Cheng; Mengting Ren; Zhening Liu; Ling Yang; Qien Shen; Yujie Liang; Hangkai Huang; Minjie Chen; Xinxin Zhou; Mosang Yu; Feng Ji; Chengfu Xu,2154,True,2025-10-01

Oxidative stress plays a key role in MASLD. The oxidative balance score (OBS) measures oxidative and reactive stress, but its relationship with MASLD and fibrosis remains unclear. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey records from 1999 to 2018 were used in this study. We used weighted multivariate logistic regression, subgroup studies, and restricted cubic spline regression to examine the associations between OBS and MASLD and fibrosis. Sensitivity studies were conducted to evaluate the robustness of the results. A total of 12,272 people enrolled in the study. There was a strong negative relationship between OBS and MASLD, and all  OBS was associated with a lower risk of MASLD, and lifestyle OBS showed strong protective effects against MASLD and fibrosis.

While most available results are rather reassuring in the general population, sarcopenia may become a concern in some special subgroups with comorbidities known to be associated with a higher risk of sarcopenia, independently of any GLP-1-based therapy. An extensive literature search was done to identify studies that investigated the effects of GLP-1-based therapies on changes in SMM and sarcopenia in special populations, i.e. older people, patients with type 2 diabetes, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, heart failure, chronic kidney disease, and metabolic dysfunction-associated liver disease. Several publications emphasized the risk of sarcopenia and recommended caution when prescribing GLP-1-based therapies in people with these comorbidities of interest. However, hard data remain scarce in the literature, without any evidence-based demonstration of a significantly increased risk of sarcopenia. Nevertheless, as old age potentiates the risk of sarcopenia, older patients with these comorbidities (especially advanced heart failure or renal disease) deserve more careful attention. While the risk of sarcopenia associated with GLP-1-based therapies remains controversial in the general population, a higher risk in special populations with comorbidities has been repeatedly emphasized despite the lack of evidence-based data in the literature. Because these agents showed major clinical benefits in patients with such comorbidities but sarcopenia could mitigate them, there is an urgent need to implement dedicated studies with appropriate measures of sarcopenia in these special populations.",2025,Oct,Diabetes & metabolism,André J Scheen,1801,True,2025-10-01
40988709,The role of premenstrual syndrome in hedonic hunger and food craving during the menstrual cycle.,"Differences in appetite, food intake, eating behaviours, and food preferences can occur throughout the menstrual cycle. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) is associated with significant emotional and physiological changes, including altered appetite and food cravings. Therefore, the relationship between PMS and hedonic hunger, food craving of individuals during the menstrual cycle phases were investigated in this study. This study was conducted on 150 women volunteers. Research data were collected using a web-based questionnaire. Four assessment stages were scheduled for each woman, and they were classified in phases according to the onset of menstruation. Participants completed premenstrual syndrome scale and anthropometric measurements were taken based on their statements at the initial assessment stage.

41082807,Human liver perfluorooctane sulfonate associates with steatotic liver disease in a sex-dependent manner.,"Perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) is a persistent and widespread contaminant found in the environment and, as a consequence, in the human body, and is linked to adverse health effects, including steatotic liver disease (SLD). Human studies on the role of PFOS in SLD have been largely epidemiological, relying on plasma without measuring liver PFOS. However, using plasma PFOS levels to evaluate fatty liver disease is not comprehensive, and the effects of PFOS in human liver have not been described. We investigated the association of PFOS in plasma (P-PFOS) and liver (L-PFOS) with clinical parameters of Metabolic dysfunction-Associated SLD (MASLD) in a large human cohort with obesity and histology-confirmed MASLD. Combining liver RNA-seq and metabolomic data from liver and plasma, we correlated L- and P-PFOS with mRNA transcripts and metabolites to identify dysregulated transcriptional and metabolic pathways. In women, L-PFOS negatively correlated with MASLD prevalence and severity. Conversely, in men, P-PFOS and L-PFOS positively associated with fibrosis. L-PFOS quartile analysis showed potential threshold effects in several histological parameters in men only. In women, L-PFOS negatively correlated with metabolites from pathways implicated in MASLD progression, including diacylglycerol and sphingolipid species. At the gene expression level, L-PFOS correlated negatively with many fibrosis-related genes involved in collagen formation and extracellular matrix organization in women only. Generally, L-PFOS correlated with many disease-relevant variables in women, but with few in men. These correlations in women were opposite the clinical and molecular changes seen in MASLD progression, while the positive correlation between L-PFOS and liver fibrosis in men suggests a positive relationship with liver disease.",2025,Oct,Environment international,Emily Flam; Viktor Liénard; Violeta Raverdy; Mehdi Derhourhi; Philippe Froguel; Amélie Bonnefond; Philippe Lefebvre; François Pattou; Delphine Eberlé; Joel T Haas; Bart Staels,1833,True,2025-10-01
41114463,"Ubc9-Mediated SUMOylation of RPL3, an Unappreciated Mechanism against Hepatocyte Senescence by Repressing the DHX9-p16 Axis.","Although Ubc9-mediated SUMOylation are recognized to regulate the multiple aspects of hepatic biological processes, its impact on hepatic senescence and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), however, is yet to be fully addressed. Herein noted an age-dependent decrease of hepatic Ubc9 expression is first noted along with an escalated decrease of protein SUMOylation, which is coupled with enhanced senescent marker expressions both in humans and mice. Interestingly, Ubc9 is dispensable for liver development at the embryonic stage. However, Ubc9 deficiency in hepatocytes rendered mice with an exacerbated hepatic aging phenotype and more susceptible to fatty liver disease and steatohepatitis following the challenge of a methionine- and choline-deficient (MCD)-diet. Ii is further demonstrated that nuclear ribosomal protein L3 (RPL3) interacts with DExD/H-box (DDX/DHX) helicases (DHX9), which then recruits RNA polymerase II to the p16 promoter to transcribe its expression, thereby exacerbating the hepatocyte aging process. However, Ubc9-mediated SUMOylation prevents RPL3 nuclear translocation, by which it represses the expression of senescent markers such as p16 to attenuate the hepatic aging process. Together, the study highlights that Ubc9-mediated SUMOylation of RPL3 could be an unappreciated mechanism against hepatic aging in clinical settings.",2025,Oct,"Advanced science (Weinheim, Baden-Wurttemberg, Germany)",Hao Xie; Zhichao Gao; Xin Liu; Shiyi Zhang; Yuhan Wang; Jia Gao; Ping Qi; Lu Zhang; Jiawei Zhao; Tian Xiong; Teng Huang; Jia Song; Qilin Yu; Shu Zhang; Yanjun Liu; Ping Yang; Maryam S Al-Motawa; Quan Gong; Junfeng Dong; Hao Yin; Fei Sun; Shiwei Liu; Cong-Yi Wang,1392,True,2025-10-01

Selected clinical studies on GLP-R1As in NAFLD are presented in this narrative review. There is evidence that treatment with GLP-R1As in NAFLD has beneficial effects on NAFLD, i.e. improvement in liver function tests and histological improvement in hepatic steatosis and inflammation, but not fibrosis. Further research is required toward the early use of GLP-R1Αs, i.e. in NAFLD patients without fibrosis to evaluate whether they may prevent the progression to fibrosis, or in patients with advanced disease in combination with other medications, which may have additive or even synergistic effects on NAFLD.",2023,01,Expert review of clinical pharmacology,Chara Tsiampali; Paraskevi Papaioannidou; Antonis Goulas; Stergios A Polyzos,1257,True,2023-01-01
41053025,Hepatic steatosis and pyroptosis are induced by the hepatitis B virus X protein via B56α-METTL3 interaction-mediated m6A modification of the NLRP3 mRNA.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) is one of the fastest-growing chronic liver diseases and is characterized by excessive steatosis, inflammation, and progressive liver injury. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) X protein (HBx) is a major viral factor that contributes to the onset and progression of MASH. Emerging evidence highlights the role of epigenetic modifications, particularly N6-methyladenosine (m6A), as prevalent modifications of mRNAs that play crucial roles in MASH pathogenesis by regulating mRNA stability, translation, processing, and nuclear export. However, the epigenetic mechanisms by which m6A modification contributes to HBx-related MASH remain poorly defined. In this study, we observed that NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3)-dependent pyroptosis and intracellular lipid accumulation are markedly elevated in the livers of HBx-transgenic (HBx-Tg) mice in vivo and in HBx-expressing hepatocytes in vitro, exacerbating liver injury and driving MASH progression. Integrated metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses of HBx-Tg mice revealed distinct gene expression alterations, suggesting a key role for m6A modification in mediating hepatic inflammation and lipotoxicity. Mechanistically, we identified methyltransferase-like 3 (METTL3) as a critical positive regulator of this process. HBx upregulated METTL3 expression and the m6A level of NLRP3 mRNA in HBx-expressing hepatocytes, whereas METTL3 knockdown or catalytic inactivation suppressed NLRP3-dependent pyroptosis. Further investigation revealed that METTL3 enhances NLRP3 mRNA stability via m6A modification at A2748 site in the coding sequence. Moreover, the protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) B56α subunit was found to interact with the METTL3 methyltransferase domain (MTD), facilitating its enzymatic activity and further increasing NLRP3 m6A methylation, thereby promoting pyroptosis and lipid accumulation in HBx-expressing hepatocytes. Importantly, treatment with STM2457, a selective inhibitor targeting the METTL3 MTD, significantly attenuated hepatic inflammation, steatohepatitis, and lipotoxicity. Taken together, our findings advance the understanding of HBx-induced hepatic lipid accumulation, steatosis, inflammasome formation, and pyroptosis, and indicate that targeting METTL3 with STM2457 intervention is a promising approach for MASH treatment.",2025,Oct,Cell death & disease,Ze-Bang Du; Tun Han; Yu-Xin Cai; Yu-Shi Shen; Jia-Shen Wu; Xiong Li; Hang-Tian Zhong; Bai-Heng Wu; Lei Zhang; Liang-Yu Wen; Xiao-Ming Luo; Zhong-Ning Lin; Yu-Chun Lin,2356,True,2025-10-01
41116872,Cross - Kingdom Dialogue of Microbial Messengers: Multi - Target Regulatory Mechanisms and Therapeutic Strategies of Gut Microbiota - Derived Extracellular Vesicles in Metabolic Diseases.,"Gut microbiota-derived extracellular vesicles (GMEVs) serve as pivotal mediators of cross-communication between microorganisms and their hosts, playing a complex and central role in the onset and progression of metabolic diseases. This review systematically summarizes the biological characteristics, molecular composition, and regulatory mechanisms of GMEVs in metabolic disorders such as obesity, diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. GMEVs facilitate dialogue along the ""gut-organ axis"" by transporting active molecules such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS), flagellin, nucleic acids, and metabolic products, thereby mediating bidirectional regulation of host metabolic homeostasis. GMEVs derived from pathogenic bacteria promote metabolic inflammation and insulin resistance by compromising the intestinal barrier, activating inflammatory pathways, and inhibiting insulin signaling. Conversely, GMEVs originating from probiotics exert protective effects by enhancing tight junction functionality, modulating immune responses, and improving lipid metabolism. Notably, the dynamic fluctuations of GMEVs are closely linked to disease progression, and their microbiota-specific molecular characteristics offer novel biomarkers for the early diagnosis of metabolic diseases. Despite the challenges posed by standardization of isolation and elucidation of underlying mechanisms, the potential applications of GMEVs in the precise prevention and treatment of metabolic diseases are vast, providing a theoretical foundation for the development of novel microbiome-based intervention strategies.

However, relatively little research has been conducted on trends in MASLD based on household income. This study aimed to examine trends in MASLD prevalence stratified by household income and identify socioeconomic factors associated with a risk of MASLD. Data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2007 to 2022 were analyzed to examine MASLD prevalence among adults in South Korea, stratified by household income levels. Household income was categorized into quartiles, and covariates including sex, age, region of residence, education level, stress level, smoking status, and drinking status were assessed. Weighted prevalence estimates were calculated to assess trends in MASLD across the study period. In addition, logistic regression models were applied to estimate adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (CIs), comparing pre-pandemic and pandemic periods as well as across income quartiles stratified by sex, age, and other covariates. A total of 70,276 individuals aged ≥19 years (male: 29,169 [41.51%]) from 2007 to 2022 were included in the analysis. MASLD prevalence increased over the study period across all household income levels. Particularly, in the medium-high and high household income levels, prevalence increased from 16.30% (95% CI, 14.83-17.76) in 2007 to 27.25% (95% CI, 24.46-30.04) in 2022 and from 15.15% (95% CI, 13.71-16.58) in 2007 to 25.44% (95% CI, 22.01-28.86) in 2022, respectively. The prevalence of MASLD exhibited a sex-specific trend, being higher among low-income females while tending to be higher among high-income males. Males, middle-aged individuals, high-stress levels, and smoking status were identified as risk factors for MASLD. This is the first study to analyze the trends of MASLD stratified by household income level in South Korea.

In this context, the selective induction of autophagy by TH in preclinical models has been identified as a promising mechanism. In this process, TH clears intrahepatic fat through lipophagy while protecting against inflammation and mitochondrial damage in hepatocytes via mitophagy. Furthermore, TH-induced aggrephagy may represent a protective mechanism to mitigate the development of MASLD-associated hepatocellular carcinoma.

Although recent orthopedic literature suggests preoperative semaglutide use may reduce complication and reoperation rates, its impact has not been studied in hand surgery. Given the overall favorable complication profile of CTR, it remains unknown if similar risk modification exists. Type II diabetes mellitus patients undergoing endoscopic carpal tunnel release (ECTR) and open carpal tunnel release (OCTR) were identified from the PearlDiver database. Exclusion criteria included the following: age <18, revision CTR, traumatic, neoplastic, or infectious diagnoses within 90 days before surgery, <90 days follow-up, and other concurrent upper-extremity procedures. Patients using semaglutide within 1 year before surgery were identified and matched 1:4 with (-)semaglutide controls. Ninety-day complications were compared by multivariable logistic regression, and 2-year reoperation was assessed by Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and log-rank test. Semaglutide was used by 689 (1.2%) of ECTR and 1,966 (0.8%) of OCTR patients. Once matched, there were 426 ECTR and 1,673 OCTR patients receiving semaglutide. Relative to ECTR (-)semaglutide controls, semaglutide reduced the odds of pneumonia (OR, 0.30 [0.13-0.58]) and urinary tract infection (OR, 0.28 [0.18-0.44]). Relative to OCTR (-)semaglutide controls, semaglutide reduced the odds of surgical site infection (SSI) (OR, 0.31 [0.18-0.51]), sepsis (OR, 0.61 [0.43-0.85]), wound dehiscence (OR, 0.25 [0.13-0.42]), pneumonia (OR, 0.26 [0.19-0.35]), and urinary tract infection (OR, 0.33 [0.27-0.40]). For both ECTR and OCTR, 2-year reoperation rates were similar for those with versus without semaglutide. The current study reinforces the low overall incidence of complications following CTR. The most clinically relevant findings were observed in OCTR patients, including reduced odds of SSI and wound dehiscence. However, 2-year reoperation rates were similar across both surgical approaches regardless of semaglutide use. These findings may have implications in the context of perioperative risk stratification.

41124864,Integrated pharmacokinetic properties and tissue distribution of Corydalis saxicola Bunting total alkaloids in HFHCD-induced mice: Implications for pharmacokinetic variability in MASH treatment.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is a typical chronic liver disease characterized by excessive lipid accumulation in the liver. It can develop to the severe stage, Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), which is accompanied by inflammation and fibrosis. Corydalis saxicola Bunting total alkaloids (CSBTA) exert therapeutic potential to fight against MASLD/MASH progression. The present study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetic (PK) variability of dehydrocavidine, palmatine and berberine, the major bioactive components of CSBTA, in normal or high-fat and high-cholesterol diet (HFHCD)-induced mice after single or multiple intragastric administration. Contents of the three alkaloids in mice plasma, tissue and cells were detected by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-MS/MS) and the expressions of drug metabolizing enzymes/transporters were measured. The pathological status definitely influenced the PK process of the three representative ingredients in different degrees, including elevated systemic exposure, liver distribution and intracellular accumulation in hepatocytes. While multiple dosing of CSBTA further raised the amounts in plasma and liver of MASH mice, especially for dehydrocavidine. Based on the transporting (transfected-HEK293 cells and Caco-2 cells model) and metabolism (liver microsomes) assay, the PK variability of the three representative alkaloids was integrally associated with the expression perturbations of Cyp450s, Oatp1b2 and P-gp. From the perspective of PK, long-term CSBTA treatment resulted in higher systemic exposures and liver distribution in MASH mice through modulating Cyp450s and specific transporters via PXR. These results provided valuable guidance for rationalizing the clinical dosage regimen in MASLD/MASH treatment.",2025,Oct,Biomedicine & pharmacotherapy = Biomedecine & pharmacotherapie,Qiushuang Sun; Huan Chen; Qianqian Lin; Yanyi Wu; Yuanyuan Lei; Xianhai Luo; Ning Li; Luzhou Xu; Sufeng Zhou; Jun Cheng; Fang Huang; Zhixia Qiu,1873,True,2025-10-01
41100462,Nonlinear association between TyG-BMI and MAFLD: A cross-sectional study.,"The relationship between the triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) and the incidence of metabolic associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) is a trending research area. This association is highly important in the realms of healthcare and public health. To explore the impact of TyG-BMI on MAFLD and its contribution to the evolution of diverse phenotypes of fatty liver. In this cross-sectional study, curve fitting was used to assess the relationships between TyG-BMI and MAFLD as well as different MAFLD phenotypes, and multivariate ordinal logistic regression methods were employed to explore the stability of these relationships. Curve fitting revealed a nonlinear relationship between TyG-BMI and MAFLD, with a critical threshold of approximately 176.78. Similar relationships were observed between TyG-BMI and different fatty liver phenotypes. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that the TyG-BMI was independently associated with different fatty liver phenotypes (nonfibrotic MAFLD odds ratio (OR) = 11.29; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 8.38-15.21, p < 0.001; fibrotic MAFLD OR = 37.24, 95% CI = 25.92-53.51, P < 0.001). Even after full variable adjustment, this relationship remained stable (nonfibrotic MAFLD OR = 5.99, 95% CI = 3.25--11.06, P < 0.001; fibrotic MAFLD OR = 5.24, 95% CI = 2.28--12.06, P < 0.001). Correlation analysis revealed a positive correlation between TyG-BMI and CAP (correlation coefficient, 0.60) and a weak positive correlation with SWE (correlation coefficient, 0.29). The TyG-BMI manifests a nonlinear relationship with the risk of developing distinct MAFLD phenotypes, suggesting its utility as a pivotal metric in the formulation of screening and preventive strategies for MAFLD.",2025,01,PloS one,Qiuping Wang; Yuan Su; Jing Niu; Yan Wang; Liping Liu; Yanhong Hao,1732,True,2025-01-01

In mammals, reduced glutathione (GSH) is a pivotal antioxidant that regulates cellular responses to redox imbalances caused by reactive oxygen and nitrogen species. The presence of reduced GSH within mitochondria is especially crucial for preserving the organelle's routine performance by eliminating hydrogen peroxide generated under both physiological and pathological conditions. Cumulative evidence indicates that MASLD is associated with a diminished mitochondrial GSH (mGSH) pool, attributed to alterations in mitochondrial membrane fluidity due to cholesterol accumulation. Therefore, strategies aimed at boosting mGSH may offer therapeutic benefits against MASLD-associated liver injury. This study aims to investigate whether l-cysteine-glutathione disulfide (l-CySSG), a proposed GSH donor and precursor, can effectively restore total and mGSH in vitro and in vivo in mice fed cholesterol-enriched (HC) or methionine-choline-deficient (MCD) diets.

Although only a minority progress to cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma, the absolute burden is substantial and continues to rise, particularly in Asia and Latin America. While population-level disparities are well documented, little is known about inequities within the scientific literature itself. We aimed to systematically map global MASLD/MASH research to identify patterns in productivity, geographic distribution, authorship, and disparities. We analyzed publications from 1980 to 2024 in the Web of Science Core Collection (extraction May 15, 2025). After excluding meeting abstracts, 36,268 records were included. Using the Bibliometrix R package, we evaluated annual production, country and institutional contributions, authorship patterns, and journal sources. Disparity analyses focused on the 1000 most cited articles, assessing country contributions, first-author sex, and journal representation. Analysis of the 1000 most cited MASLD/MASH publications revealed rapid growth since the early 2000s, peaking at over 60 papers annually between 2010 and 2020, with an apparent recent decline due to citation lag. The United States dominated both output and citations, far surpassing other countries. Hepatology, Journal of Hepatology, and Gastroenterology accounted for most influential publications. Leading contributors included two authors, with 50 articles each. Striking gender disparities emerged: only 3% of top 100 papers had female first authors. Overall, research remains concentrated geographically, institutionally, and by author, with persistent inequities in authorship representation. MASLD/MASH research is highly concentrated by geography, journals, and authorship, with pronounced gender disparities.

41143244,Metabolic Parkinson's disease.,"Parkinson's disease (PD) is a neurodegenerative disorder primarily characterized by the loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra. While most cases are sporadic, there is growing evidence of a link between PD and metabolic dysfunctions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Proposed pathogenic mechanisms underlying this overlap include insulin resistance and chronic inflammation. Similar patterns of cellular damage are observed in both metabolic disorders and PD, including mitochondrial dysfunction, impaired autophagy, oxidative stress, endoplasmic reticulum stress, and gut microbiota alterations. Given the current lack of disease-modifying therapies for PD, there is increasing interest in interventions traditionally used to treat metabolic conditions, such as lifestyle and dietary modifications. Notably, antidiabetic drugs like metformin and incretin mimetics have shown beneficial effects in PD due to their neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory properties, their ability to restore insulin sensitivity, and their role in reducing neuronal susceptibility to toxic insults, as demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies. Conversely, traditionally antiparkinsonian drugs such as bromocriptine have long been approved for improving glycemic control in diabetes. This cross-efficacy between drugs used for the two conditions may indirectly support the hypothesis of a shared pathogenesis. A deeper understanding of the connections between metabolic disorders and PD could pave the way for novel preventive and therapeutic strategies.",2025,01,Frontiers in aging neuroscience,Federica Invernizzi; Lorenzo Ciocca; Elena Contaldi; Donato Inverso; Daniela Calandrella; Francesco Mignone; Michela Barichella; Ioannis Ugo Isaias; Gianni Pezzoli,1594,True,2025-01-01
41092960,Nonanticoagulant Strategies for Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis.,"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) remains a major cause of preventable morbidity and mortality. Prophylaxis with anticoagulation is limited by bleeding risk, contraindications, and patient-specific factors. Interest has therefore grown in alternative or adjunctive nonanticoagulant strategies that can mitigate thrombotic risk without increasing bleeding complications. Aspirin has demonstrated efficacy in both primary and secondary prevention of VTE. Most studies and trials have been undertaken in an orthopaedic population but with favorable safety profile. Statins have been shown to reduce VTE incidence without increased bleeding in several trials. Metformin appears to reduce prothrombotic mechanisms in type 2 diabetes. Observational studies have suggested its use to lower VTE risk. However, randomized data are lacking. Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have been shown to reduce weight, improve metabolic control, and possess anti-inflammatory effects. Evidence suggests GLP-1 RAs may reduce VTE risk. However, findings are inconsistent across observational and trial-based analyses. Other emerging alternatives include hydroxychloroquine, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9) inhibitors (post hoc analyses of cardiovascular trials suggesting lower VTE rates potentially via lipoprotein (a) reduction), sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (overall neutral in meta-analyses of randomized control trials with some real-world evidence vs. comparators), and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system modulators (mixed observational data and no trial-proven benefit).

GLP-1 plays a pivotal role in regulating postprandial glucose homeostasis. Firstly, type I starch-lecithin complex (OSL) was fabricated with excellent digestion resistance (47.89 % resistant starch) and self-assembly performance (0.58 mg/mL CMC). Lecithin solutions were then incorporated into OSL to form OSL/lecithin nanoparticles (180-200 nm, negatively charged surface) with different distribution ratios of lecithin inside and outside starch helical cavity. With distribution ratio of lecithin increased from 1:1.25 to 1:10, β-lactoglobulin colon release improved by 21.67 %. Microbial fermentation led OSL/Lecithin based nanoparticles to release β-lactoglobulin, lecithin, reducing sugars, and SCFAs, which collectively boosted GLP-1 secretion by 169.48 % and 36.07 % compared with β-lactoglobulin and mixed OSL/Lecithin, respectively.

In the clinical management of NAFLD, various western pharmaceuticals were widely utilized. This network meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of common western medications for NAFLD patients. We systematically reviewed and screened articles based on predesigned criterion about western medications for NAFLD, which were from Embase, Cochrane Library, PubMed, CNKI, WanFang, and China Science and Technology Journal Database until August 1, 2024. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials of patients aged 18 or older with NAFLD, comparing Western medicines to placebos or other Western medicine treatments. The risk of bias assessment tool 2.0 from the Cochrane system was used to assess the quality of the included articles. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted using WinBUGS 1.4.3 with a random-effects model and Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Treatment rankings were based on Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking Curve (SUCRA) values, and heterogeneity was assessed with I Based on 37 included articles involving 7673 patients, pioglitazone demonstrated the most significant effects in resolving nonalcoholic steatohepatitis without worsening fibrosis, increasing high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, and achieving a ≥ 2-point reduction in NAFLD activity scores (odds ratio [OR] = 0.09, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.01 to 0.81), with a SUCRA probability of 91.4%.

Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the leading cause of liver disease worldwide. Accurate fibrosis assessment is essential in MASLD patients for prognosis and treatment. Vibration-controlled transient elastography using FibroScan can overestimate liver fibrosis in obese patients. This retrospective study included 245 MASLD patients who underwent FibroScan and liver biopsy. Participants were included with FibroScan controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) 250+, 10 liver stiffness measurements (LSM) with IQR/med ≤30%, and 10+ portal tracts on biopsy. Discordance was defined as a ≥2 stage difference between FibroScan and liver biopsy. Participants were stratified by BMI and obesity class to assess their association with discordance. We conducted a post hoc analysis to determine the implication of discordance on resmetirom eligibility. Data was entered into SPSS v28. Among 245 patients, 29.4% exhibited a ≥2 stage discordance between FibroScan and biopsy. Class 3 obesity was significantly associated with discordance (38.6%) compared with class 2 obesity (24.6%) and class 0 to 1 obesity (18.4%). FibroScan suggested cirrhosis in 66 (57.9%) participants with class 3 obesity, however, liver biopsy confirmed cirrhosis in only 16 (24.2%) subjects and identified 28 (42.4%) subjects with stages 2 to 3 fibrosis, making them potentially eligible for resmetirom.

T1, T2, fat fraction (FF), and R2* values were obtained in the regions of interest (ROIs) delineated in the left and right liver lobes of each mouse. The liver T1 and T2 values were corrected by establishing a generalized linear model (GLM) to obtain fat- and iron-corrected T1 and T2 (cT1_A and cT2_A, respectively). The liver pathological scores were determined by two experienced pathologists using the clinical research network scoring standard for non-alcoholic steatosis hepatitis. BAT UCP1 expression was quantified as the percentage of the positively stained area in three representative regions. The association between the liver pathological score and BAT UCP1 expression was analyzed. The performance of the MRI parameters in evaluating liver inflammation was analyzed and compared. The efficacy of assessing BAT UCP1 expression using MRI parameters was also evaluated. Diagnostic thresholds were determined using Youden's J statistic. Pairwise comparisons of the area under the curve (AUC) values were performed using DeLong's test. The mice models were divided into the normal control (NC; n=13) and MASLD (n=50) groups based on the liver pathological scores. There was a significant difference in BAT UCP1 expression between the NC and MASLD groups (P<0.001). UCP1 expression in the MASLD mice was positively correlated with liver inflammation activity (r=0.762, P<0.001). Among the MRI parameters, cT2_A was the best predictor of liver inflammation [AUC =0.717, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.614-0.820]. K-means cluster analysis was used to divide the MASLD mice into high- and low-grade BAT UCP1 expression groups (F=370.404, P<0.001). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that cT2_A demonstrated superior predictive value for UCP1 levels (AUC =0.741, 95% CI: 0.644-0.838). SyMRI-derived cT2_A values were used in the quantitative assessment of hepatic inflammation and to predict BAT UCP1 expression levels in MASLD mice. The results suggest that cT2_A could serve as a non-invasive biomarker in metabolic disease monitoring.",2025,Oct,Quantitative imaging in medicine and surgery,Zhi Dong; Lujie Li; Mengjuan Huo; Yinhong Zhang; Xiaoqi Zhou; Mimi Tang; Zhenpeng Peng; Wei Cui; Jiawei Liu; Jifei Wang; Huasong Cai; Shi-Ting Feng; Yin Li; Yanji Luo,2769,True,2025-10-01

41050856,Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists and suicide risk in individuals with diabetes and Cannabis use disorder.,"The current study is to examine the association between GLP-1 receptor agonist (GLP-1 RA) use and suicide attempt risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), including those with comorbid cannabis use disorder (CUD). We conducted a retrospective study using the TriNetX Research Network. Adults aged 30-85 years with a diagnosis of T2DM were categorized by GLP-1 RA exposure and CUD sourced from over 20 countries across the Americas, Europe-Middle East-Africa, and Asia-Pacific from 2003 to 2023. Individuals with a prior diagnosis of suicidal ideation were excluded. The primary outcome was a new diagnosis of suicide attempt within one year. Cox proportional hazards models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (aHRs), controlling for age, sex, depression, body mass index, and glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to visualize cumulative risk. Among 6,424,228 individuals with T2DM, GLP-1 RA use was associated with significantly lower risk of suicide attempt compared to unexposed individuals (aHR: 0.63; 95 % CI: 0.47,0.85). In contrast, patients with CUD exhibited markedly elevated risk (aHR: 5.50; 95 % CI: 4.39,6.89). This elevated risk persisted among those concurrently using GLP-1 RAs and diagnosed with CUD (aHR: 5.75; 95 % CI: 3.42,9.69). No significant risk reduction was observed among CUD patients using GLP-1 RAs compared to those not using them (aHR: 1.00; 95 % CI 0.37-2.69). The inverse association between GLP-1 RAs and suicide attempt was attenuated among cannabis users. These findings underscore the importance of addressing substance use when assessing psychiatric risk in diabetes care.",2025,Oct,Preventive medicine reports,Yesh Dhruva; Erick Messias; Ping-I Lin,1670,True,2025-10-01

39843136,Leveraging nuclear receptor mediated transcriptional signaling for drug discovery: Historical insights and current advances.,"Nuclear receptors (NRs) are ligand-activated transcription factors that regulate gene expression in response to physiological signals, such as hormones and other chemical messengers. These receptors either activate or repress the transcription of target genes, which in turn promotes or suppresses physiological processes governing growth, differentiation, and homeostasis. NRs bind to specific DNA sequences and, in response to ligand binding, either promote or hinder the assembly of the transcriptional machinery, thereby influencing gene expression at the transcriptional level. These receptors are involved in a wide range of pathological conditions, including cancer, metabolic disorders, chronic inflammatory diseases, and immune system-related disorders. Modulation of NR function through targeted drugs has shown therapeutic benefits in treating such conditions. NR-targeted drugs, which either completely or selectively activate or block receptor function, represent a significant class of clinically valuable therapeutics. However, the pathways of NR-mediated gene expression and the resulting physiological effects are complex, involving crosstalk between various biomolecular components. As a result, NR-targeted drug discovery is challenging. With improved understanding of how NRs regulate physiological functions and deeper insights into their molecular structure, the process of NR-targeted drug discovery has evolved. While many traditional NR-targeting drugs are associated with side effects of varying severity, new drug candidates are being designed to minimize these adverse effects. Given that NR activity varies according to the tissue in which they are expressed and the specific isoform that is activated or repressed, achieving selectivity in targeting specific tissues and isoform classes may help reduce systemic side effects. In a recent breakthrough, the isoform-selective, hepato-targeted thyroid hormone-β agonist, Resmetirom (marketed as Rezdiffra), was approved for the treatment of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis. This chapter explores the structural and mechanistic principles guiding NR-targeted drug discovery and provides insights into recent developments in this field.",2025,01,Advances in protein chemistry and structural biology,Riya Ben Patel; Surbhi Kumari Barnwal; Arabi Mohammed Saleh M A; Dileep Francis,2210,True,2025-01-01

Here, we profiled monotherapy with semaglutide (glucagon-like-receptor-1 receptor agonist) and lanifibranor (pan-peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor agonist) in a diet-induced obese (DIO) mouse model of NASH-HCC. Disease progression was characterized in male C57BL/6 J mice fed the GAN (Gubra Amylin NASH) diet high in fat, fructose and cholesterol for 12-72 weeks (n = 15 per group). Other GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mice fed the GAN diet for 54 weeks and with biopsy-confirmed NASH (NAFLD Activity Score ≥ 5) and advanced fibrosis (stage F3) received vehicle (n = 16), semaglutide (30 nmol/kg, s.c., n = 15), or lanifibranor (30 mg/kg, p.o., n = 15) once daily for 14 weeks. GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mice demonstrated progressive NASH, fibrosis and HCC burden. Tumors presented with histological and molecular signatures of poor prognostic HCC. Consistent with clinical trial outcomes in NASH patients, both lanifibranor and semaglutide improved NASH while only lanifibranor reduced fibrosis in GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mice. Notably, only semaglutide reduced tumor burden in GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mice. In conclusion, the GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mouse is a clinical translational model of NASH-HCC. Semaglutide improves both NASH and tumor burden in GAN DIO-NASH-HCC mice, highlighting the suitability of this preclinical model for profiling novel drug therapies targeting NASH-HCC.",2023,Dec,Scientific reports,Henrik H Hansen; Susanne Pors; Maja W Andersen; Mogens Vyberg; Jacob Nøhr-Meldgaard; Malte Hasle Nielsen; Denise Oró; Martin Rønn Madsen; Monika Lewinska; Mathias B Møllerhøj; Andreas Nygaard Madsen; Michael Feigh,1613,True,2023-12-01
41064267,Non-HDL-C and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio as predictors of hepatic steatosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"The association between novel atherogenic indices (NAIs) and the pathophysiology of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has been extensively researched. Among these, non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio are novel indices linked to a higher risk for metabolic syndrome - and possibly MASLD. The current review evaluates the possible utility of these NAIs as markers for MASLD. MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science were systematically searched. Screening and data extraction were performed by two independent reviewers. All observational studies reporting standardized mean differences (SMD), odds ratios (ORs) and components of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis were included in evidence synthesis. Meta-analysis was performed using a random effects model. 34 studies were included in the quantitative synthesis. Non-HDL-C (SMD = 1.11, 95% CI 0.49-1.73) and non-HDL-C/HDL-C (SMD = 0.77, 95% 0.55-0.98) were significantly higher in MASLD patients. Similarly both indices were associated with increased odds for development or diagnosis of MASLD (non-HDL-C OR = 1.34, 95% CI 1.19-1.48; non-HDL-C/HDL-C OR = 1.68, 95% CI 1.30-2.04). Non-HDL-C (AUC = 0.68, 95% CI 0.65-0.72) and non-HDL-C/HDL-C demonstrated ""good"" utility (AUC = 0.74, 95% CI 0.70-0.77) as a diagnostic marker for MASLD. Our findings showed a significant association between these NAIs and MASLD. Both non-HDL-C and non-HDL-C/HDL-C ratio also showed an acceptable performance as biomarkers for MASLD. The use of these NAIs as part of a complex model for prediction of MASLD may prove even more beneficial in the clinical setting.

41151693,"Sweroside: A comprehensive review of its biosynthesis, pharmacokinetics, pharmacology, and safety.","Sweroside is a naturally occurring iridoid compound known for its various biological activities. Despite growing interest, the fragmented nature of existing research and the lack of a comprehensive review have hindered a clear understanding of its therapeutic potential and research gaps. This review aims to provide an integrated overview of the research progress on sweroside, thereby highlighting current progress and proposing directions for future research. In the biosynthetic pathway of sweroside, the upstream formation of iridotrial is better characterized than its downstream structural modification steps. Following oral administration, sweroside exhibits moderate absorption, extensive tissue distribution, and diverse metabolites primarily formed through parental modifications, aglycone metabolism, and N-heterocyclization of the aglycone. To date, no serious side effects have been reported for sweroside. However, substantial gaps remain in the relevant research. Preclinical studies have indicated that sweroside has the potential to ameliorate metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and has cardioprotective, antiosteoporosis, and antitumor activity. These activities are linked to its ability to regulate energy and metabolic homeostasis, as well as to mediate anti-inflammatory and antioxidant responses. The clinical potential of sweroside may be limited by its poor bioavailability. Key priorities for sweroside include the identification of anti-MASLD active metabolites and mechanisms, standardized preclinical toxicological assessments, optimization of its pharmacokinetic properties and targeting efficiency, and functional characterization of key enzymes involved in its downstream biosynthesis.",2025,Oct,Pharmacological research,Zhiqiang Gan; Jingqiu Shi; Wenbin Liu; Yuying Song; Xinmei Xu; Mingkun Meng; Xianli Meng; Yue Liu; Ce Tang; Yi Zhang,1749,True,2025-10-01

39602049,Semaglutide and the risk of adverse liver outcomes in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and type 2 diabetes: a multi-institutional cohort study.,"Semaglutide has shown potential liver benefits in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). However, no direct comparisons have been made between semaglutide and other antidiabetic medications, including sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors (SGLT2i), thiazolidinediones (TZD), and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4i), regarding liver outcomes in patients with both NAFLD and T2D. This retrospective cohort study utilized the TriNetX electronic health record database, a multinational and multi-institutional database. Adults with NAFLD and T2D who received their first prescription for either semaglutide or other antidiabetic medications were included. New users of semaglutide were matched 1:1 via propensity score matching with users of SGLT2i, DPP-4i, and TZD. The primary outcome was major adverse liver outcome (MALO), a composite end point consisting of decompensated cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver transplantation. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of MALO and all-cause mortality. A total of 648,070 adult patients with T2D and NAFLD were identified, and patients were categorized into three different comparison groups based on their drug of interest. Semaglutide was associated with a lower risk of MALO compared to SGLT2i (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 0.73; 95% CI 0.60-0.88), DPP-4i (aHR, 0.72; 95% CI 0.56-0.86), and TZD (aHR, 0.76; 95% CI 0.56-0.99). Additionally, semaglutide was linked to a lower risk of all-cause mortality compared to SGLT2i (aHR, 0.62; 95% CI 0.53-0.72), DPP-4i (aHR, 0.42; 95% CI 0.36-0.49), and TZD (aHR, 0.67; 95% CI 0.54-0.83).

41135760,Different measures of sodium intake and the risk of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: Evidence from the UK Biobank.,"While excessive sodium intake is associated with hepatic steatosis, its precise role in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) remains underexplored. This study investigated the relationship between different measures of sodium intake and the risk of MASLD. The complete data of 286,073 participants on their self-reported frequency of adding salt to food and estimated 24-h urinary sodium excretion from the UK Biobank were analyzed. Cox proportional hazards models quantified hazard ratios (HRs) for incident MASLD, cirrhosis or liver cancer, and liver-related mortality. Mediation analyses evaluated potential mediating between sodium intake and MASLD. Energy-adjusted dietary sodium intake was evaluated in a sub-cohort of 119,073 participants with ≥2 dietary recalls. During a median follow-up of 13.3 years, 3,147 MASLD, 1,354 cirrhosis or liver cancer, and 523 liver-related mortality cases were identified. After adjusting for confounders, participants who reported ""always"" adding salt had an increased risk of MASLD (HR=1.36, 95% CI=1.19-1.56). Higher urinary sodium excretion was also associated with incident MASLD (HR=1.62, 95% CI=1.53-1.72), displaying a J-shaped nonlinear relationship with the threshold point at 1.93 g/d. Inflammatory dysregulation, insulin resistance and renal function impairment partly mediated this association. In the sub-cohort, every 1g increase in energy-adjusted dietary sodium intake conferred a 14 % higher risk of MASLD (HR=1.14, 95% CI=1.01-1.28). The habit of always adding salt to food, a 24-h urinary sodium excretion above 1.93 g/day, and energy-adjusted dietary sodium intake above 1.49g/d increased the risk of MASLD, partly mediated through inflammation, insulin resistance, and renal dysfunction.

41124780,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, cardiometabolic risk factors, and cardiovascular disease.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects over one third of adults worldwide and represents a growing public health challenge. In addition to becoming the leading cause of end-stage liver disease and liver transplantation in the United States, MASLD is currently a major risk factor for metabolic and cardiovascular disease. The diagnosis of MASLD is defined by the presence of a fatty liver in combination with one or more of five cardiometabolic risk factors, excluding excessive alcohol consumption. While the individual risk factors are all observationally associated with a fatty liver, the connection between these cardiometabolic risk factors and fatty liver has not been fully explained. In this review we describe how fatty liver is associated with each of the cardiometabolic criteria of the MASLD diagnosis. We review the pathophysiological mechanisms between the cardiometabolic risk factors contributing to the MASLD diagnosis and development of fatty liver. We describe how MASLD associates with cardiovascular disease and suggest that fatty liver is associated with cardiovascular disease through very low-density lipoproteins. Finally, we describe current guidelines and ongoing pharmaceutical approaches in the treatment of MASLD with the focus on cardiovascular risk factors. This review provides a comprehensive overview of MASLD.

39663572,Autophagy-dependent hepatocyte secretion of DBI/ACBP induced by glucocorticoids determines the pathogenesis of Cushing syndrome.,"DBI/ACBP is a phylogenetically ancient hormone that stimulates appetite and lipo-anabolism. In response to starvation, DBI/ACBP is secreted through a noncanonical, macroautophagy/autophagy-dependent pathway. The physiological hunger reflex involves starvation-induced secretion of DBI/ACBP from multiple cell types. DBI/ACBP concentrations subsequently increase in extracellular fluids to stimulate food intake. Recently, we observed that glucocorticoids, which are endogenous stress hormones as well as anti-inflammatory drugs, upregulate DBI/ACBP expression at the transcriptional level and stimulate autophagy in hepatocytes, thereby causing a surge in circulating DBI/ACBP levels. Prolonged increase in glucocorticoid concentrations causes an extreme form of metabolic syndrome, dubbed ""Cushing syndrome"", which is characterized by clinical features including hyperphagia, hyperdipsia, dyslipidemia, hyperinsulinemia, insulin resistance, lipodystrophy, visceral adiposity, steatosis, sarcopenia and osteoporosis. Mice and patients with Cushing syndrome exhibit supraphysiological DBI/ACBP plasma levels. Of note, neutralization of extracellular DBI/ACBP protein with antibodies or mutation of the DBI/ACBP receptor (i.e. the GABRG2 subunit of GABR [gamma-aminobutyric acid type A receptor]) renders mice resistant to the induction of Cushing syndrome.

Lifestyle changes remain the cornerstone of management, but adherence is challenging, prompting the exploration of therapeutic options. Resmetirom, targeting thyroid hormone receptors, regulates liver enzymes and fat metabolism, showing potential as a treatment for MASH. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the safety of resmetirom in MASH patients. Three randomized controlled trials with adult participants were analyzed, sourced from PubMed and the Cochrane Library until April 2024. Participants received either resmetirom or placebo, and data on adverse effects and efficacy outcomes were extracted. Statistical analyses, including risk ratios (RRs) and confidence intervals (CI), were performed using Review Manager (version 5.4.1) with a random-effects model. The pooled RR for serious adverse events was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.63-1.14; P  = 0.28), indicating no significant difference. However, diarrhea (RR = 1.82, 95% CI: 1.41-2.35; P  < 0.001) and nausea (RR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.31-2.28; P  < 0.001) showed higher incidence.

41072805,Consensus position statements for the standardized application of histological grading and staging systems in MASH clinical trials.,"Assessment of histologic disease activity (grading) and fibrosis (staging) is a prerequisite for patient selection and evaluation of treatment response in clinical trials of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). The lack of universally accepted definitions of histological components required for metabolic dysfunction-associated disease (MASLD) grading and staging, inconsistent histologic interpretations, and absence of guidelines for the application of currently used scoring systems contribute to high inter-observer variation and also influence supervised machine learning algorithms. The International MASLD Pathology Group (IMPG) of 25 expert liver pathologists and a statistician was established to develop guidance for the histological assessment of liver biopsies in MASH for clinical trials and to define standards for processing of liver biopsies as well as to further refine criteria for histological MASLD grading and staging. Statements were generated by three IMPG working subgroups (WG) and were evaluated in a Delphi procedure. The IMPG WGs issued a total of 278 primary statements which were evaluated in a first Delphi round (DR) yielding 162 statements with 80% or higher agreement. Remaining 116 statements were discussed and revised or not further considered. The resulting 33 revised statements were evaluated in a second DR yielding 192 final statements with 80% or higher agreement. The IMPG statements provide for the first time guidelines to promote consensus among liver pathologists for the histopathological evaluation and scoring of liver biopsies for MASH clinical trials. Furthermore, they may be used to inform supervised machine learning algorithms for quantitative MASLD histology assessments. Inter- (and intra-) observer variations in the histological interpretation of key morphological features of MASH limit the precision of histological grading and staging as well as the diagnosis of the histological MASLD types, MASL and MASH. This is thought to account in clinical trials, at least in part, for screening failure as well as variable placebo response rates, potentially obscuring treatment effects. The International MASLD Pathology Group, consisting of 25 expert liver pathologists, generated consensus statements for histopathological procedures, technical aspects and histological criteria for the diagnosis of MASH, for grading disease activity and staging fibrosis. These may provide a basis for standardized histologic interpretation and the development of AI-based grading and staging algorithms for clinical trials of MASH.",2025,Oct,Journal of hepatology,Carolin Lackner; Annette S H Gouw; Venancio Alves; Johanna Arola; Pierre Bedossa; Cynthia Behling; Elisabeth M Brunt; Alastair Burt; Andrew Clouston; Oscar Cummings; Zachary D Goodman; Maria Guido; Cynthia Guy; Stefan G Hubscher; Prodromos Hytiroglou; David Kleiner; Rish Pai; Valerie Paradis; Young Nyun Park; Archana Rastogi; Peter Schirmacher; Aileen Wee; Hirohisa Yano; Matthew Yeh; Alexander Avian; Dina G Tiniakos,2598,True,2025-10-01
40364529,Review Article: GLP-1 Receptor Agonists and Glucagon/GIP/GLP-1 Receptor Dual or Triple Agonists-Mechanism of Action and Emerging Therapeutic Landscape in MASLD.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is primarily managed through diet and lifestyle modifications. However, these behavioural interventions alone may not achieve disease regression or remission, and maintaining long-term adherence is challenging. Incretin mimetics and other gastrointestinal hormones targeting the pleiotropic pathophysiological pathways underlying MASLD have now emerged as promising disease-modifying therapies. This is a comprehensive review summarising the role of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists and glucagon/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP)/GLP-1 receptor dual or triple agonists in the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Only clinical trials with endpoints assessed by liver histology were included for a robust evaluation of therapeutic efficacy. Recent evidence from phase 2 clinical trials for MASH demonstrated that pharmacological agents based on GLP-1 receptor agonism are effective in improving disease activity. Additionally, tirzepatide and survodutide showed potential clinical benefits in reducing fibrosis. Other cardiometabolic benefits observed include weight loss and improvements in glycaemic control and lipid profile. Adherence to treatment may be limited by gastrointestinal side effects, though they were found to be generally mild to moderate in severity. An interim analysis of the semaglutide phase 3 trial confirmed its efficacy in improving steatohepatitis and demonstrated its potential to improve fibrosis. GLP-1 receptor agonists, alone or in combination with GIP and/or glucagon receptor agonists, represent promising, effective pharmacotherapies for the treatment of MASLD/MASH. Larger and longer-duration clinical trials are needed to further evaluate the efficacy and safety of GIP receptor and glucagon receptor agonism.",2025,Jun,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,Maryam Zafer; Federica Tavaglione; Manuel Romero-Gómez; Rohit Loomba,1878,True,2025-06-01

Despite the recent Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval of Resmetirom as the first drug for patients with Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and significant fibrosis, and several ongoing clinical trials, lifestyle changes aimed at achieving sustained weight loss remain a cornerstone in the management of these patients. In addition to regular and structured physical activity, diet is crucial. Several studies have demonstrated the benefits of the Mediterranean diet in this regard, and there is also emerging evidence on the vegetarian diet and its different patterns. This review aims to summarize the currently available evidence on the potential benefits of a vegetarian diet in patients with MASLD, as well as exploring its potential limitations.",2025,May,Nutrients,Nicola Pugliese; Diletta De Deo; Matteo Soleri; Francesca Colapietro; Roberto Vettor; Alessio Aghemo,904,True,2025-05-01

Currently, non-invasive testing has been widely used in early-stage efficacy evaluation and patient screening, and evidence of association with clinical outcomes has gradually been established, and a number of new non-invasive scoring systems are also emerging.

41058954,Dermatologic Implications of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonist Medications.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) are an innovative class of medications primarily used to manage type 2 diabetes and obesity. These agents not only improve glycemic control but also promote significant weight loss and reduce cardiovascular risk. GLP-1RAs are associated with various dermatologic effects, including injection-site reactions and immune-mediated responses such as hypersensitivity, urticaria, and bullous pemphigoid. ""Ozempic face,"" a term describing facial fat loss, has gained media attention due to its cosmetic implications. Additionally, hair loss, particularly in the form of telogen effluvium, has been observed, potentially linked to rapid weight loss from GLP-1RA use. Emerging evidence also highlights the therapeutic potential of GLP-1RAs in enhancing wound healing and treating inflammatory skin conditions like psoriasis. With the increasing use of GLP-1RAs for weight management, clinicians should remain alert to dermatologic side effects and consider appropriate dermatologic consultations when needed. Further research is essential to optimize the safe and effective use of GLP-1RAs, ensuring therapeutic benefits are maximized while minimizing adverse dermatologic outcomes.",2025,Oct,Skin appendage disorders,Olivia M Burke; Brianna Sa; David Alvarez Cespedes; Antonella Tosti,1227,True,2025-10-01

38338770,Semaglutide Modulates Extracellular Matrix Production of LX-2 Cells via Exosomes and Improves Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD).,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is closely related to some metabolic disorders, such as central obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), such as semaglutide, may have therapeutic roles in MASLD associated with T2D. This study aims to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effectiveness of semaglutide on MASLD in terms of progression from liver steatosis to fibrosis. We characterized exosomes from ten patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) before (T0) and after 12 months (T12) of treatment with once-weekly subcutaneous semaglutide. Six of ten patients were considered responders to therapy (R) based on MASLD severity downgrading by at least one class according to a validated ultrasonographic (US) score. Normal hepatocytes (HEPA-RG) and stellate (LX-2) cells were challenged with exosomes from R and NR patients, isolated before and after 12 months of therapy. Exosomes from both R and NR patients isolated at T0 significantly affected LX-2 viability. After 12 months of treatment, only those isolated from R patients restored cell viability, whereas those from NR patients did not. No effects were observed on HEPA-RG cells. Exosomes at T12 from R but not from NR patients significantly decreased the production of α-SMA, a marker of LX-2 activation, a liver stellate cell model, and ph-SMAD2 and CTGF, involved in fibrosis processes. TGF-β1 was not modulated by the exosomes of R and NR patients. As a downstream effect, Vimentin, Collagen 1A1, and Fibronectin extracellular matrix components were also downregulated, as measured by droplets digital PCR. In conclusion, these results shed light on the potential effectiveness of semaglutide in improving liver fibrosis in MASLD.",2024,Jan,International journal of molecular sciences,Maria Principia Scavo; Giuseppe Lisco; Nicoletta Depalo; Federica Rizzi; Sara Volpe; Valentina Arrè; Livianna Carrieri; Maria Notarnicola; Valentina De Nunzio; Maria Lucia Curri; Giovanni De Pergola; Giuseppina Piazzolla; Gianluigi Giannelli,1779,True,2024-01-01
41058075,Serum proteomics of insulin resistance disorders distinguish MASLD from lipodystrophy and insulin receptor defects.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is linked to obesity, metabolic syndrome and insulin resistance (IR). In IR associated with obesity or lipodystrophy (LD), caused by missing adipose tissue), hyperinsulinemia stimulates hepatic lipogenesis, causing steatotic liver disease (SLD). In contrast, insulin receptor pathogenic variants (INSR), despite hyperinsulinemia and IR, do not promote hepatic lipogenesis and steatosis. We aimed to understand SLD pathophysiology by comparing serum proteomic signatures of MASLD, LD, and INSR. Single-center study of fasting serum proteome using SomaScan assay in 30 LD, 29 INSR, and 16 people with MASLD. Key targets were assessed in the hepatic transcriptome of MASLD patients (n=19) and in HepG2 cells. Of 6,412 proteins, 567 differed between at least two groups. The proteome profiles clearly separated INSR from the other groups, while MASLD and LD displayed similarity, primarily in proteins involved in metabolism, liver injury, and fibrosis. Several proteins were uniquely elevated in INSR and LD compared to MASLD, particularly Factor IX (F9) and liver-expressed antimicrobial peptide 2 (LEAP2). Serum levels of F9 and LEAP2 correlated with their hepatic expression, with in-vitro expression unaffected by leptin, insulin, or glucose treatment. This first comparative proteomics study identified shared and unique pathways in IR disorders. MASLD and LD share features, suggesting similar drivers of liver disease progression. Key liver-derived proteins differ between MASLD, INSR and LD, due to unique disorder features. We demonstrate the utility of proteomics and rare disorder studies in interrogating pathogenesis of common disorders like MASLD.",2025,Oct,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Maria Mironova; Allison Wing; Brent S Abel; Maren C Podszun; Rebecca J Brown; Yaron Rotman,1724,True,2025-10-01

It is strongly linked to obesity and metabolic dysfunction, con-tributing to cardiovascular and neurocognitive complications. Tirzepatide, a dual GIP/GLP-1 re-ceptor agonist, has shown significant potential for weight loss with metabolic benefits, making it a potential therapeutic strategy for OSA by reducing fat deposition around the upper airway, im-proving insulin sensitivity, and lowering systemic inflammation. Emerging clinical studies have shown potential improvement in apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and oxygenation. In this review, we have explored the role of tirzepatide in managing OSA by targeting obesity, metabolic dysfunction, and airway stability. Here, we have also examined tirzepatide mechanisms by highlighting clinical trials to find its efficacy in reducing OSA severity and improving patient outcomes.",2025,Oct,Current hypertension reviews,Gursimran Singh; Taresh Jaswal; Sourabh Kosey; Ranjeet Kumar; Amandeep Kaur,1044,True,2025-10-01

A Medline and Embase search was performed up to 31st January 2025 for RCTs on EMA (European Medicines Agency)-approved weight-loss interventions in adults with overweight/obesity. The primary endpoint was total body weight loss (TBWL%), analysed at different time points: 26-52, 53-104, 105-156, and ≥156 weeks. Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality, quality of life, and serious adverse events (SAE). Weighted mean difference and 95% confidence intervals (WMD, 95% CI) for continuous variables and Mantel-Haenszel odds ratio (MH-OR, 95% CI) for categorical variables were calculated using random effect models. The study was registered on the PROSPERO website (CRD42024625338). In trials enroling subjects in class I of obesity, tirzepatide resulted in equal effectiveness to both OAGB and RYGB, and it was significantly superior to all the other comparisons. In trials on class II of obesity, tirzepatide was significantly superior to all the other comparisons and inferior to both OAGB and RYGB. Semaglutide was associated with a higher TBWL% than the other OMMs (with the notable exception of tirzepatide), and it was equally effective to EBP, GCP, and LAGB. In trials enroling patients with a mean BMI >40 kg/m In patients affected by mild to moderate obesity, newer OMMs (i.e., tirzepatide and semaglutide) appear to be valid alternatives to EBP and MBS. They could be preliminarily chosen as a first-line option based on similar efficacy and greater safety and tolerability. Higher degrees of obesity could be more effectively treated with MBS, the efficacy of which, with the notable exception of LAGB and GCP, appears superior to other treatments, especially in the long term.",2025,Oct,"Diabetes, obesity & metabolism",Rocco Barazzoni; Matteo Monami; Silvio Buscemi; Luca Busetto; Maurizio De Luca; Giuseppe Navarra; Benedetta Ragghianti; Giovanni Antonio Silverii; Amanda Belluzzi; Edoardo Mannucci; Paolo Sbraccia,2237,True,2025-10-01

The emergence of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists (GLP1RAs) for weight loss has introduced a subset of patients experiencing rapid weight loss with associated facial-volume changes, colloquially known as ""Ozempic Face"" (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark). This case series describes 4 patients on GLP1RAs who, despite rapid weight loss, maintained facial volume following treatment with hypderilute CaHA-CMC in the lower face. Four patients undergoing rapid weight loss with GLP1RA were retrospectively evaluated following hyperdilute (1:3) CaHA-CMC treatment in the lower face. Patient demographics, BMI, average weight loss, and follow-up assessments were reviewed. Responses were evaluated using standardized photographs, the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), and patient satisfaction surveys. All 4 GLP1RA users completed both treatment sessions and 6 months follow-up. They lost an average of 24.3 ± 10.4 lb, equivalent to -9.2 ± 4.8% of baseline body weight, yet objective facial metrics remained stable or improved. Average cheek volume increased 9.8%, jowl volume declined 55.8%, nasolabial-fold depth decreased 46.2%, and marionette-line depth decreased 20.6%. At 6 months, investigator GAIS rated every patient ""improved"" or ""much improved,"" and 100% of patients reported being ""satisfied"" or ""very satisfied."" Hyperdilute CaHA-CMC may offer benefits in preserving facial volume for patients undergoing weight loss with GLP-1 agonists.

41009468,A Pharmacological Dose of Liraglutide Improves Mitochondrial Performance in Mouse Leydig Cells.,"Male fertility has declined over the years, partly due to metabolic disorders such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes. Antidiabetic drugs, including GLP-1 receptor agonists like liraglutide, are widely used to manage these conditions and aid in weight loss. Within the male reproductive tract, Leydig cells (LCs) are essential since they produce testosterone. Notably, the influence of antidiabetics on LCs remains a subject of limited investigation. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the effect of liraglutide on the physiology of LCs. To this end, we cultured LCs (BLTK1 cell line) without (control) or in the presence of selected concentrations of liraglutide. We then assessed their metabolic viability, cell proliferation, LDH release, ROS production, mitochondrial membrane potential, and in vivo mitochondrial cell performance, as well as the number of mtDNA copies. We also measured androstenedione production. Our results showed that liraglutide at pharmacological and supra-pharmacological concentrations increased the metabolic viability of LCs and reduced ROS production at all concentrations. Furthermore, the pharmacological concentration of liraglutide increased the basal respiration, maximal respiration, proton leak, and oxygen consumption rate related to ATP-linked production. Androstenedione production remained unchanged, which may be related to the inherent limitations of the cell line in supporting steroidogenesis. Overall, our findings suggest that liraglutide exhibits a potential protective effect on LC function, particularly by enhancing metabolic viability, reducing oxidative stress, and improving mitochondrial performance, highlighting its potential beyond the established role in diabetes and weight management.",2025,Sep,International journal of molecular sciences,Bruno Oliveira-Lopes; Patrícia C Braga; Pedro F Oliveira; Marco G Alves; Raquel L Bernardino,1739,True,2025-09-01

Here, we found that depletion of the gut microbiome in adult zebrafish led to the development of steatotic liver disease in animals on standard diets. Using metabolomics and isotope tracing, we found that dietary glucose was converted to sorbitol by host intestinal cells. Although bacteria degraded sorbitol in control animals, sorbitol was transferred to the livers of fish when the gut microbiome had been depleted. Within the liver, sorbitol was converted into fructose 1-phosphate, which subsequently activated glucokinase and increased glycolytic flux, leading to increased hepatic glycogen and fat content. Inhibition of sorbitol production in microbiome-depleted animals was sufficient to prevent the development of steatotic liver, and colonizing the intestines of microbiome-depleted fish with sorbitol-degrading",2025,Oct,Science signaling,Madelyn M Jackstadt; Ronald Fowle-Grider; Mun-Gu Song; Matthew H Ward; Madison Barr; Kevin Cho; Hector H Palacios; Samuel Klein; Leah P Shriver; Gary J Patti,952,True,2025-10-01
40604322,Incretin-based therapies for the treatment of obesity-related diseases.,"Obesity-related disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) are expected to increase by approximately 40% from 2020 to 2030. DALYs and mortality related to obesity are the consequence of multiple comorbidities such as cardiovascular (i.e., heart failure) and metabolic diseases (i.e. type 2 diabetes [T2D], metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease [MASLD]). Lifestyle interventions represent the foundation of obesity treatment, yet an escalation to pharmacological and/or surgical interventions is often needed. Liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide are incretin-based therapies currently approved by FDA for the management of obesity, while triple GIPR/GCGR/GLP-1R agonist retatrutide (LY3437943), the cagrilintide/semaglutide (CagriSema) 2.4 mg combination, high-dose oral semaglutide, and oral orforglipron are in advanced stages of development. Incretin-based therapies have been associated with a body weight (BW) reduction of ≥5% in at least half of patients in most randomized controlled trials (RCT) and real-world studies (RWS). Semaglutide and tirzepatide have also displayed a mean 60-69% 10-years relative risk reduction of T2D development. In line with evidence accrued in patients with T2D, incretin-based therapies produced a favorable effect on traditional cardiovascular risk factors, such as lipids and blood pressure, and even reduced the risk of major cardiovascular events and heart failure-related events in individuals with obesity, as recently demonstrated for the first time in the SELECT trial with semaglutide 2.4 mg once-weekly. Moreover, incretin-based therapies have also been proven beneficial on obesity-related comorbidities, such as knee osteoarthritis (KOA), obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) syndrome, and MASLD. Further research is needed to improve our understanding of their effects on obesity-related comorbidities and the underlying mechanism, whether involving direct effects on target tissues or mediated by improvement in BW, glucose levels and other CV risk factors.",2024,Nov,npj metabolic health and disease,Irene Caruso; Angelo Cignarelli; Gian Pio Sorice; Sebastio Perrini; Francesco Giorgino,2023,True,2024-11-01

Different prevention and intervention measures against obesity include diet, physical activity, education, coaching or medication or a combination of several aspects have been investigated. This review systematically assesses the effectiveness of lifestyle, dietary, educational, and pharmacological interventions on weight, body composition, and military readiness in active-duty personnel. We carried out a systematic review based on the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search was conducted in various electronic databases from 2000 to July 2024. The search strategy combined three concepts: military population, outcome terms, interventions or programs. For the review, 21 articles met the inclusion criteria (total n = 1696). Where possible, the effect size (ES) was calculated. In studies that only examined exercise, minor effects were reported, e.g. a reduction in weight (-0.5 kg), Body Mass Index (BMI) (-0.3 kg/m²), waist circumference (-0.1 cm) and body fat percentage (-1.1%) without relevant statistical ES. Studies with nutritional programs reported low to moderate ES. Combined programs including dietary and exercise countermeasures showed to be more effective than programs based on diet or exercise alone. Combined programs with exercise and educational methods showed a moderate to large effect size (ES 0.6-1.3) for weight reduction. Pharmacological treatment for reducing fat intake resulted in a larger effect sizes for weight loss. The greatest efficacy (ES > 1.0) was observed for a combined intervention program consisting of lifestyle changing components based on individually tailored cognitive behavioral therapies, psychoeducation, exercise and nutritional interventions. Effective countermeasure for reducing body weight found in this study were combined interventions, like education on lifestyle changes, dietary habits and promotion of physical activity in military personnel, as well as by ketogenic dietary interventions combined with physical activity and followed by pharmacological intervention approaches. Combined interventions appear promising in some studies, but future evaluations may focus on combinations of physical activity and exercise with new pharmaceutical approaches like Semaglutide or Bimagrumab medication in the long term for military personnel due to probable favorable body composition adaptations and military readiness.",2025,Oct,"Journal of occupational medicine and toxicology (London, England)",Lorenz Scheit; Lisa Baustert; Jan Schröder,2567,True,2025-10-01

Effectiveness of formula diet-based lifestyle intervention vs. pharmacological antiglycemic therapy on weight loss and HbA1c reduction in type 2 diabetes patients-a systematic review.,"Lifestyle intervention is the basis in type 2 diabetes therapy and leads, combined with formula diet, to substantial improvements in body weight and glycemic control up to diabetes remission. However, pharmacological therapies have also shown promising results. The aim of this systematic review was to compare the effects of large-sized formula diet-based lifestyle interventions vs. pharmacological interventions with glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), GLP-1, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) combinations and sodium glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT-2) inhibitors on weight and HbA1c reduction in obese type 2 diabetes patients. Literature searches were performed using PubMed for articles published until February 5, 2025. Primary and secondary outcomes were changes in weight [kg] and HbA1c [%] determined as estimated treatment difference (ETD) of intention-to-treat analyses (with a treatment policy approach). Of 1,409 identified articles, 54 articles describing 3 formula diet-based lifestyle interventions as well as 47 randomized, placebo-controlled pharmacological studies met our inclusion criteria including n=87.871 patients (32.8 ± 1.7 kg/m², 60 ± 4 years, 43 ± 7% women). Formula diet-based lifestyle intervention might more strongly reduce weight compared with pharmacological interventions with GIP/GLP-1 RAs or SGLT-2 inhibitors after <12 months (studies' mean values: -5.6 vs. -2.6 kg) or ≥12-month intervention periods (-7.3 vs. -3.1 kg). Despite a trend for treatment superiority of pharmacological therapies in the short term (-0.9 vs. -0.6%), long-term HbA1c reduction was comparable between lifestyle and pharmacological interventions (-0.7%). There is evidence that formula diet-based lifestyle intervention might improve weight loss to a greater extent than pharmacotherapies with comparable long-term glycemic control. Thus, formula diet-based lifestyle intervention might be a valid therapy option for obese patients with type 2 diabetes.",2025,01,Frontiers in endocrinology,Kerstin Kempf; Martin Röhling; Stephan Martin,2007,True,2025-01-01

Differences emerged in T0-T1 variation between the formulations in HbA1c, lipid profile, blood pressure. CAP significantly decreased only in InjS. GLP-1 quite similarly increased; insulin, glucagon and GIP did not vary. InjS and OrS did not modify TNFα, IL-10 (an anti-inflammatory cytokine) and MCP-1, while IL-18 was reduced only by InjS. When exploring oxidative stress, AGEs were unaffected, Thiobarbituric acid reactive substances decreased in InjS, 4-Hydroxynonenal was reduced in OrS. In T2D + MASLD subjects, InjS, better than OrS, improves metabolic control; a significant reduction of IL-18 by InjS, and a mild anti-oxidative effect of both formulations are reported for the first time.",2025,Sep,Acta diabetologica,Giovanni Petralli; Alice Del Zoppo; Chiara Rovera; Francesco Raggi; Antonio Salvati; Diego Moriconi; Mariarosaria Distaso; Maurizia Rossana Brunetto; Anna Solini,1733,True,2025-09-01
41065428,The effect of obesity interventions on male fertility: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Obesity is a prevalent modifiable cause of male factor infertility. Preconception guidelines recommend men maintain a healthy weight; however, they provide limited guidance regarding methods or volume of weight loss for men with obesity. First-line interventions for weight loss involve lifestyle optimization (healthy diet and exercise), followed by pharmacotherapy or bariatric surgery in severe cases. Each modality has differing weight loss potential and complications for which the reproductive implications are currently unclear. To synthesize the available evidence regarding the reproductive effects of obesity interventions in men with obesity. Where possible, to evaluate whether the observed effects depend on the magnitude of weight loss. Searches for articles published in English was performed using PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Scopus from inception until December 2024, using prespecified keywords pertaining to four categories: male, overweight/obesity, weight loss (bariatric surgery, nutrition, diet, lifestyle, exercise, pharmacotherapy) and fertility (conception, assisted reproduction, sperm, semen). Studies of reproductive-aged men (18-50 years) who underwent an obesity intervention with established weight loss benefits and undertook repeated assessment of reproduction capacity (semen analysis, conception rates, assisted reproduction outcomes) before and after the intervention were included. Meta-analysis was performed when two or more studies of the same modality assessed an outcome measure in a manner suitable for meta-analysis. A meta-regression considering weight loss achieved was performed when five or more suitable studies were available. Narrative review of studies not suitable for meta-analysis occurred. 32 studies were included in the analysis, with one study assessing both lifestyle interventions and pharmacotherapy. Assessment of conception rates and assisted reproduction was limited across all modalities. In almost all cases, the effect of obesity interventions on semen quality was examined as a surrogate for reproductive capacity and the certainty of evidence was low. Bariatric surgery was assessed in 18 studies, including 12 quasi-experimental studies, one randomized controlled trial, one case series and four case reports. Fixed- and random-effects meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials identified no differences in sperm parameters between control and intervention arms across any intervention, although small sample size limits interpretability. Random-effects meta-analyses of pre-post outcomes identified no clinically significant semen parameters or DNA damage changes following bariatric surgery. Pharmacotherapy (metformin and liraglutide) was assessed in five studies, including four quasi-experimental studies and one case report. There were insufficient data to draw clear conclusions regarding the impact of these agents on fertility outcomes. Lifestyle interventions were assessed in 10 studies, including five quasi-experimental studies and five randomized controlled trials. Fixed-effect meta-analysis identified improvements in sperm normal morphology (Mean difference = 0.59%, 95% Confidence interval = [0.23, 0.94]), and progressive motility (10.56% [8.97, 12.15]) following a lifestyle intervention. Data regarding weight loss interventions and male fertility is limited primarily to observational studies examining semen quality. Improvements in semen quality following lifestyle interventions suggest a potential benefit of optimizing nutrition and physical activity, whereas a limited change with bariatric surgery indicates obesity-associated sperm dysfunction does not resolve in a dose-dependent manner with weight loss and/or negative effects of rapid weight loss exist. Substantial knowledge gaps were identified, including limited randomized trials, inadequate examination of conception outcomes and limited assessment of GLP-1 agonist effects.

41043189,"Impact of GLP-1 receptor agonists on stroke, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and intracerebral hemorrhage: a propensity-matched multi-institutional cohort study.","The authors evaluated whether glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1-RAs) improve outcomes in patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage (sICH), and acute ischemic stroke (AIS) and reduce the overall incidence of these events. This retrospective study leveraged TriNetX data (2014-2024) to identify patients with aSAH, sICH, or AIS. Individuals receiving exenatide, lixisenatide, semaglutide, dulaglutide, liraglutide, or tirzepatide within 8 weeks of diagnosis were propensity matched to controls. Outcomes (e.g., mortality, rebleeding/recurrence, seizures, hydrocephalus) were assessed at 6 and 12 months; the incidence rates of stroke types were examined at 1 and 2 years. For aSAH patients, GLP-1-RA use at 6 months reduced rebleeding (OR 0.73, p = 0.003) and mortality (OR 0.41, p < 0.001) and at 1 year lowered cognitive deficits (OR 0.63, p = 0.034) and mortality (OR 0.39, p < 0.001). In sICH patients, GLP-1-RAs decreased hydrocephalus (OR 0.37, p = 0.005) and seizures (OR 0.56, p = 0.007) at 6 months, with persistent benefits at 1 year (hydrocephalus, OR 0.38, p = 0.007; seizures, OR 0.63, p = 0.018), alongside lower mortality (OR 0.45-0.40, both p < 0.001) and rebleeding (OR 0.70-0.69, both p < 0.001) rates. In AIS patients, mortality fell at 6 months (OR 0.27, p < 0.001) and 1 year (OR 0.44, p < 0.001), with reduced recurrence (OR 0.60, p < 0.001) and lower hydrocephalus (OR 0.32, p < 0.001) and seizure (OR 0.43, p < 0.001) rates at 6 months. At 1 year, GLP-1-RA users had lower incidence rates of SAH (OR 0.64, p = 0.001), ICH (OR 0.62, p < 0.001), and AIS (OR 0.82, p = 0.003), which were sustained at 2 years (ORs 0.77-0.87, all p < 0.05). Adverse events were similar. GLP-1-RAs were associated with improved survival and fewer complications across stroke subtypes, plus reduced hemorrhagic and ischemic stroke incidence.

37786277,Design of the phase 3 MAESTRO clinical program to evaluate resmetirom for the treatment of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.,"Non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a progressive form of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) associated with steatosis, hepatocellular injury, inflammation and fibrosis. In a Phase 2 trial in adults with NASH (NCT02912260), resmetirom, an orally administered, liver-targeted thyroid hormone receptor-β selective agonist, significantly reduced hepatic fat (via imaging) and resolved NASH without worsening fibrosis (via liver biopsy) in a significant number of patients compared with placebo. To present the design of the Phase 3 MAESTRO clinical programme evaluating resmetirom for treatment of NASH (MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 [NCT04197479], MAESTRO-NAFLD-OLE [NCT04951219], MAESTRO-NASH [NCT03900429], MAESTRO-NASH-OUTCOMES [NCT05500222]). MAESTRO-NASH is a pivotal serial biopsy trial in up to 2000 adults with biopsy-confirmed at-risk NASH. Patients are randomised to a once-daily oral placebo, 80 mg resmetirom, or 100 mg resmetirom. Liver biopsies are conducted at screening, week 52 and month 54. MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 is a 52-week safety trial in ~1400 adults with NAFLD/presumed NASH (based on non-invasive testing); ~700 patients from MAESTRO-NAFLD-1 are enrolled in MAESTRO-NAFLD-OLE, a 52-week active treatment extension to further evaluate safety. MAESTRO-NASH-OUTCOMES is enrolling 700 adults with well-compensated NASH cirrhosis to evaluate the potential for resmetirom to slow progression to hepatic decompensation events. Non-invasive tests (biomarkers, imaging) are assessed longitudinally throughout, in addition to validated patient-reported outcomes. The MAESTRO clinical programme was designed in conjunction with regulatory authorities to support approval of resmetirom for treatment of NASH. The surrogate endpoints, based on week 52 liver biopsy, serum biomarkers and imaging, are confirmed by long-term clinical liver-related outcomes in MAESTRO-NASH (month 54) and MAESTRO-NASH-OUTCOMES (time to event).",2024,Jan,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,Stephen A Harrison; Vlad Ratziu; Quentin M Anstee; Mazen Noureddin; Arun J Sanyal; Jörn M Schattenberg; Pierre Bedossa; Mustafa R Bashir; David Schneider; Rebecca Taub; Meena Bansal; Kris V Kowdley; Zobair M Younossi; Rohit Loomba,1925,True,2024-01-01
41123471,Utilization and Outcomes of Glucagon-Like Peptide-1 Receptor Agonists in Posttransplant Diabetes Mellitus in Kidney Transplant Recipients.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP1RA) provide survival benefits in people with diabetes, including kidney transplant (KT) recipients with pre-existing diabetes. Post-transplant diabetes mellitus (PTDM) is common, but the benefits of GLP1RAs remain undefined in this population. We aim to describe current usage practices and outcomes in PTDM. We used USRDS and Medicare claims data (2013-2022) to conduct a drug utilization profile of GLP1RA among 7681 first-time adult KT recipients with PTDM. We used survival analysis to estimate GLP1RA initiation incidence and associated patient, graft, and safety outcomes. A total of 430 adult KT recipients with PTDM were prescribed GLP1RA. Dulaglutide was the most commonly prescribed medication (46.1%). The 5-year cumulative incidence of GLP-1 receptor agonists prescription was 9.8%. Median (interquartile range) time from PTDM diagnosis to first prescription was 1.7 (0.6, 3.4) years. GLP1RA use was not associated with a difference in the risk of mortality or graft failure but was associated with a 1.80-fold (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11-2.91) increased risk of diabetic retinopathy. No increased risk of pancreatitis, biliary complications, or medullary thyroid cancer were identified. GLP1RA use in KT recipients with PTDM was not associated with graft or patient survival, though longer follow-up is necessary. GLP1RA use was associated with an increased risk of diabetic retinopathy, and care should be taken when initiating these agents.",2025,Oct,Clinical transplantation,Garyn Metoyer; Harriz Z Whiteson; Yusi Chen; Yiting Li; Chenxi Gao; Gayathri Menon; Sunjae Bae; Krista L Lentine; Dorry L Segev; Mara A McAdams-DeMarco; Babak J Orandi,1511,True,2025-10-01
40980971,Target Trial Emulations of GLP-1 and Dual GLP-1/GIP Agonists to Reduce Major Adverse Liver Outcomes in Type 2 Diabetes.,"Clinical trials suggest GLP-1 receptor agonists (RAs) and dual glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) RAs improve metabolic dysfunction associated with steatohepatitis (MASH) in patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD). We aimed to compare the estimate of the relative effect of tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide in reducing the risk of major adverse liver outcomes (MALOs) in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We emulated target trials based on a real-world network of electronic health records (EHRs) from over 150 million patients. Three target trials were emulated, among eligible patients with T2D who had no prior MALO diagnosis, by comparing therapy involving tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide versus DPP4 inhibitor (DPP4i) therapy. We identified the first-ever diagnosis of MALO occurring within a 2-year follow-up period and compared across the treatment groups using Kaplan-Meier survival analyses. Cohorts underwent propensity score matching 1:1 for confounders. We performed sensitivity analyses relating to geographical location, combination with metformin, and by treatment adherence. We also performed head-to-head analyses of the incretin-based therapies. After matching, we identified three target trials comprised of 10 165, 56 702, and 8 301 patients treated with tirzepatide, semaglutide, and liraglutide, respectively (1:1 with reference patients) for a 2-year period. Tirzepatide (HR 0.53 [95% CI 0.40, 0.71]) and semaglutide (HR 0.81 [0.72, 0.90]) were associated with a significant reduction in the risk of incident MALO compared with DPP4i, whereas liraglutide was not (HR 1.04 [95% CI 0.79, 1.36]). In head-to-head comparisons, tirzepatide was associated with a significantly lower risk of incident MALO compared with liraglutide (HR 0.56 [95% CI 0.39, 0.79]), but not semaglutide (HR 0.83 [95% CI 0.63, 1.09]). Semaglutide was not associated with a reduced risk compared with liraglutide (HR 0.77 [95% CI 0.57, 1.05]). Treatment with tirzepatide and, to a lesser extent, semaglutide, in patients with T2D, was associated with a lower incidence of MALO compared with DPP4i after 2 years; largely driven by a reduction in the rates of compensated and decompensated cirrhosis. A reduction in MALO was not demonstrated with the use of liraglutide. These findings highlight a comparative benefit of tirzepatide (and semaglutide) versus DPP4i and should prompt more robust, longer-term randomised controlled studies to evaluate their role in preventing MALO in this increasingly prevalent patient population with co-existing T2D and MASLD.",2025,Oct,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,Alex E Henney; David R Riley; Matthew Anson; Shazli Azmi; Uazman Alam; Daniel J Cuthbertson,2662,True,2025-10-01
41130147,Whole genome sequencing of terbinafine-sensitive canine strains of Trichophyton indotineae isolated from India.,"Trichophyton indotineae (earlier Trichophyton mentagrophytes ITS genotype VIII) is a newly defined dermatophyte species frequently reported from India. The strains representing T. indotineae cause dermatophytosis in humans, and some strains exhibit resistance to terbinafine. This study aims to characterize the animal strains of T. indotineae at the genomic level and compare them with human strains and other Trichophyton species. In this study, we report the generation of de novo WGS data for two strains of T. indotineae isolated from canines of northern India. The genome sequence was subjected to functional and structural annotation, followed by comparative genomics and phylogeny. Genome assembly and annotation revealed a 22 Mb genome in both strains, comprising approximately 6800 protein-coding genes, and a 24 Kb contig representing the mitochondrion. Functional annotations revealed the presence of around 200 CAZymes and secretomes. The identified proteins include various proteolytic enzymes, such as keratinases, lyases, fungalysins, subtilisins, and chitinases. Orthologous cluster comparison among T. indotineae and T. rubrum identified a LysM effector virulence factor associated with the sequestration of chitin oligosaccharides unique to T. indotineae. Taxonomic inferences involving 69 species representing the Genus Trichophyton revealed similar clustering in genome ANI, mash distance, and core-genome phylogeny. Within all approaches, a total of 16 Indian strains represented T. indotineae. The SNP difference between any two T. indiotinae strains ranged from 8 to 257, indicating limited strain variation within the species. The core-genome phylogeny revealed two major clusters, with no cluster indicating a specific host association. Correlating their phenotypic susceptibility to the anti-fungal drug terbinafine (TRB), the coding sequences (CDS) maintained no amino acid substitutions at key positions 393 and 397. The comparative analysis of the squalene epoxidase gene across the 16 strains revealed a high frequency of SNPs at the 397th position in the squalene epoxidase genes in terbinafine-resistant strains. To conclude, the study indicates similar genome composition in strains of T. indiotineae from canine and human origin, irrespective of the TRB resistance phenotype. The pathogen and genotypes circulating among humans and animals need to be continuously monitored to determine the exact role of animals in the transmission and endemicity of T. indotineae in India.",2025,Oct,Journal de mycologie medicale,Prasad Thomas; Sonu S Nair; Mostafa Y Abdel-Glil; Sudhir K Prajapati; Subbaiyan Anbazhagan; Shubham Saini; Athira V; Bablu Kumar; Vinod K Chaturvedi; Shivaprakash M Rudramurthy; G Saikumar; Premanshu Dandapat,2510,True,2025-10-01
40992778,GLP-1 agonists-induced autoimmune pancreatitis.,"Two main types of autoimmune pancreatitis (AIP) have been described: type 1, linked to IgG4-related disease, and type 2, associated with inflammatory bowel diseases. Recently, a third type has been associated with immune checkpoint inhibitors. In our series, we report three cases of type 1 AIP following glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 agonist treatment for type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM). GLP-1 agonists may be implicated in pancreatitis development mainly due to their effect on biliary motility and pancreatic cell proliferation. While causation remains unproven, it could be possible that GLP-1 induced pancreatic hypertrophy might influence cell metabolism and antigen presentation in predisposed individuals, altering the immunological milieu and eventually leading to type 1 AIP. Similarly, we hypothesise that GLP-1 agonists use in type 1 AIP patients may lead to pancreatitis recurrence. Accordingly, insulin-based therapeutic regimens may be preferred in type 2 DM patients also affected by type 1 AIP.",2025,Sep,BMJ case reports,Jasmin Mahajne; Ernestina Angarola; Emanuel Della Torre; Marco Lanzillotta,1011,True,2025-09-01
41054801,Novel GLP-1-Based Medications for Type 2 Diabetes and Obesity.,"The approvals of semaglutide and tirzepatide have set new benchmarks in the treatment of type 2 diabetes and obesity. Building on their success, novel GLP-1-based therapeutics are rapidly advancing. These next-generation agents engage not only GLP-1 receptors but also those for other gastro-entero-pancreatic hormones such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), glucagon, amylin, and peptide YY (PYY) to enhance energy uptake, storage, and expenditure through synergistic mechanisms. Both GIP receptor agonism and antagonism, particularly in combination with GLP-1 receptor agonism, have shown promise. Maridebart cafraglutide, combining GLP-1R agonism with GIPR antagonism, exemplifies this innovative approach. Glucagon co-agonists like survodutide and mazdutide have demonstrated significant weight loss and improved glycemic control. Amylin-based agents, including CagriSema (cagrilintide + semaglutide) and amycretin, enhance satiety and glycemic outcomes through complementary actions. Further innovation is seen in triple agonists such as retatrutide, which targets GIP, GLP-1, and glucagon receptors to amplify metabolic effects. Meanwhile, the emergence of orally active small-molecule GLP-1 receptor agonists like danuglipron and orforglipron, which are resistant to enzymatic degradation, marks a major advance in patient-friendly drug delivery. This review explores the mechanisms, clinical development, and therapeutic potential of these novel agents, excluding already approved drugs like liraglutide, semaglutide, and tirzepatide. We highlight how multi-receptor agonists and oral GLP-1-based therapies may reshape the future landscape of obesity and type 2 diabetes treatment by offering more effective and better-tolerated options.",2025,Oct,Endocrine reviews,Jang Won Son; Carel W le Roux; Matthias Blüher; Michael A Nauck; Soo Lim,1766,True,2025-10-01

41079153,"Exploring the effects of high protein versus high fat snacks on satiety, gut hormones and insulin secretion in women with overweight and obesity: A randomized clinical trial.","Nuts generally blunt the postprandial increases in glucose levels and increase satiety, while yogurt studies yield inconclusive results regarding post-meal hunger. This study investigated the effects of high-protein, and high-fat snacks, specifically Greek yogurt, and peanuts, on satiety, gut hormones, and insulin secretion in women with overweight and obesity. The hypothesis posited that peanuts would exhibit a more beneficial impact on satiety, gut hormones, and insulin levels compared to Greek yogurt. The two-arm parallel randomized trial involved fifty participants aged 30-40 years with a BMI between 25 and 35 kg/m Revealed that Greek yogurt induced a statistically significant increase in satiety 30 min after consumption and markedly elevated postprandial insulin levels compared to peanuts. Moreover, notable intergroup differences in postprandial insulin concentrations were observed in the Greek yogurt group. The peanut group had no significant alterations in PYY, GLP-1, CCK or GHRL levels. Pre-snacking, GHRL levels exhibited a positive association with abdominal circumference, weight, and fat mass, while CCK levels displayed a negative association with abdominal circumference, weight, and fat mass. Greek yogurt may enhance satiety and thus has the potential to positively influence body weight in individuals with overweight and/or obesity. Further research is required to elucidate appetite control mechanisms.

41074575,"Ocular Complications of SGLT-2 Inhibitors, GLP-1 Receptor Agonists, and DPP-4 Inhibitors in T2DM Treatments: A Retrospective Real-World Cohort Study.","Glaucoma is a leading cause of irreversible vision loss worldwide, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is increasingly recognized as a risk factor for glaucoma. This study compared the effects of 3 classes of antidiabetic drugs-sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2is), glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs), and dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors (DPP-4is)-on ocular and systemic complications in adults with T2DM. Using the TriNetX database from 2015 to 2025, adults aged ≥ 40 years initiating SGLT-2is, GLP-1 RAs, or DPP-4is were identified and matched through propensity score methods to create three cohorts. The primary outcomes included open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension, with secondary outcomes of cataract, diabetic retinopathy, macular edema, and various systemic events. The matched cohorts included 68,283 patients (SGLT-2is vs. GLP-1 RAs), 69,765 patients (SGLT-2is vs. DPP-4is), and 55,760 patients (GLP-1 RAs vs. DPP-4is). Compared with GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4is, SGLT-2i use was associated with significantly lower risks of open-angle glaucoma (HR: 0.88 and 0.90), ocular hypertension (HR: 0.78 and 0.90), cataract (HR: 0.84 and 0.87), diabetic retinopathy (HR: 0.84 and 0.87), and macular edema (HR: 0.77 and 0.71). Conversely, GLP-1 RAs demonstrated stronger protective effects against systemic complications, such as diabetic nephropathy or chronic kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, dementia, cerebral infarction, and ischemic heart disease. These findings suggest that SGLT-2is may be prioritized in T2DM patients at higher risk for ocular complications, while GLP-1 RAs may be preferred when systemic risk reduction is the primary therapeutic goal.",2025,Oct,Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics,Lee-Yuan Lin; Jie-Syuan Wu; Wei-Jung Jeng; Chen-Hsin Tsai; Jia-Wei Sun; Cheng-Hao Kuo; Fara Silvia Yuliani; Shyh-Hsiang Lin,1702,True,2025-10-01

PAD is common in T2DM and increases the risk of adverse cardiovascular and limb outcomes. This meta-analysis assessed the impact of GLP-1 RAs on cardiovascular and limb-related outcomes in patients with T2DM and PAD. A systematic search of PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL, ScienceDirect, and ClinicalTrials.gov was conducted through May 24, 2025. Primary outcomes included all-cause mortality (ACM) and cardiovascular mortality (CVM). Secondary outcomes were major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE),), myocardial infarction, stroke, major adverse limb events (MALE), glycemic control (HbA1c), body weight, and adverse events. Pooled risk ratios and mean differences were calculated using random-effects models. Six randomized controlled trials, including 7,645 participants met the inclusion criteria. GLP-1 RAs significantly reduced ACM (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.70 to 0.99, p = 0.04, I² = 0%), MACE (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.76 to 0.98, p = 0.02, I² = 0%), and improved HbA1c (MD -0.72%, p = 0.02), with no significant effect on weight, major adverse limb events (MALE), CVM, myocardial infarction, or stroke. In conclusion, GLP-1 RAs lower MACE and ACM in patients with T2DM and PAD but do not clearly benefit limb-specific outcomes, highlighting the need for larger, PAD-focused trials to clarify their role in limb protection.",2025,Sep,The American journal of cardiology,Syed Hasan Shuja; Muhammad Hamza Shuja; Ayesha Shaukat; Ramish Hannat; Ilsa Ahmed; Siad Adam; Ahmed Abdelkhalek; Mah I Kan Changez; Irfan Ullah; Raheel Ahmed; Bernardo Cortese,1544,True,2025-09-01
41094027,Pre-stroke weight loss by glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor and neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 activation improves post-stroke functional recovery in male diabetic mouse models.,"Type 2 diabetes is associated with worsened stroke outcome and lasting disability. The underlying mechanisms are undetermined, and no therapy is available. We experimentally investigated whether pharmacologically targeting obesity, which is highly prevalent in type 2 diabetes, before stroke enhances neurological recovery in type 2 diabetes. To induce weight loss, we employed the glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonist semaglutide and the neuropeptide Y receptor Y2 (NPY2R) agonist BI8271, which potentiates GLP-1R-mediated weight loss. We also investigated potential acute neuroprotective effects induced by these treatments, independently of metabolic regulation. C57BL/6J mice were fed with a high-fat diet for 5 months to induce obesity and features of type 2 diabetes (i.e. hyperglycaemia and insulin resistance). Weight loss was induced by 4-week administration of semaglutide and/or BI8271. As a control for the effect of weight loss, a vehicle (PBS)-treated group was switched to standard diet to achieve the same weight range and the same percentage weight loss within the same time frame as those receiving semaglutide/BI8271. Thereafter, mice were subjected to stroke by transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). Stroke recovery (the primary outcome) was assessed by measuring the recovery of grip strength and the lateralised sensorimotor integration. Brains and serum were collected, and stroke volume and serum IGF-1 levels were quantified (secondary outcomes). In additional studies, type 2 diabetic mice were subjected to tMCAO and injected with semaglutide and/or BI8271 1 and 24 h after reperfusion. Acute neuroprotection (the primary outcome) was assessed by a grip strength test and by quantifying stroke volume and the number of surviving neuronal nuclear marker (NeuN)-positive neurons. We report that pre-stroke weight loss by GLP-1R activation, and more potently by dual co-activation of GLP-1 and NPY2 receptors, is a pharmacologically targetable mechanism, upstream of glycaemic regulation, through which post-stroke recovery is achieved. Moreover, we show that post-stroke recovery in type 2 diabetes is inversely associated with peripheral IGF-1 levels. Finally, GLP-1R and NPY2R activation can also improve stroke recovery through acute neuroprotection if they are given acutely after stroke, independently of their metabolic effects. The diabetes and obesity epidemics are increasing the incidence of stroke, and consequently the need for treatments to improve stroke outcome. Our results indicate that clinically used type 2 diabetes treatments could be employed in a preventive role to improve stroke outcome by exerting dual pharmacological action: weight loss and acute neuroprotection. These findings could have novel therapeutic implications for many people.",2025,Oct,Diabetologia,Ellen Vercalsteren; Dimitra Karampatsi; Maria Neicu; Mihaela Oana Romanitan; Peter Haebel; Katherin Bleymehl; Thomas Nyström; Thomas Klein; Vladimer Darsalia; Cesare Patrone,2818,True,2025-10-01
41146589,Gestational Melatonin Supplementation Attenuates Maternal Sleep Deprivation-Induced Steatohepatitis Susceptibility in Offspring.,"Sleep deprivation (SD) is a common issue among pregnant women. Maternal SD led to adverse effects on offspring health such as cognitive impairment through dysregulated metabolic pathways. However, it remains unknown whether maternal SD increases the offspring's susceptibility to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) development. Here, we induced maternal SD during pregnancy and observed that maternal SD during pregnancy promoted the development of diet-induced NASH in offspring of both sexes in adulthood, with exacerbation of liver weight gain, hepatic steatosis, fibrosis, and hepatic dysfunction. The primary hepatocytes isolated from SD offspring were also more susceptible to palmitate acid-induced lipotoxic injury. Mechanistically, the detrimental effects of maternal SD were associated with augmented activation of inflammatory and apoptosis pathways in offspring liver tissues, which were attributed to upregulation of the transcription factor nuclear receptor subfamily 4 group A member 3 (NR4A3). The melatonin signalling is reported to be pivotally affected by sleep disturbance both at the circulation and the placenta, and our further analysis revealed that melatonin supplementation during maternal SD normalised NR4A3 expression in offspring liver and alleviated the increased steatohepatitis susceptibility in offspring. Taken together, these results suggest that maternal SD during pregnancy predisposes offspring to NASH development in adulthood via an NR4A3-dependent mechanism, and maternal melatonin supplementation may hold promise for improving liver health in the offspring.",2025,Oct,Cell proliferation,Fei Guo; Zexin Yang; Junsen She; Chen Fang; Yizhi Hu; Hefeng Huang; Ling Gao,1603,True,2025-10-01
41123105,GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with MGUS: A real-world propensity-matched study.,"Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is a premalignant plasma cell disorder with potential progression to multiple myeloma (MM). Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated potential anti-neoplastic properties. This study evaluated the association between GLP-1 RA use and clinical outcomes in individuals with MGUS and concurrent DM, overweight or obesity. A retrospective cohort study was conducted using the TriNetX global health research network. Adults with MGUS and either DM or overweight/obesity were identified. Propensity score matching (1:1) was performed, resulting in two balanced cohorts. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary outcomes included overall survival (OS), time to progression to multiple myeloma (MM) and major cardiovascular events, including myocardial infarction (MI), ischemic stroke, ischemic heart disease and heart failure (HF). Among 30,034 matched patients, 823 patients in the GLP-1 RA group and 2317 in the control group progressed to symptomatic MM or died. GLP-1 RA use was associated with significantly improved PFS [HR (95% CI): .63 (.58-.68)] and OS [HR (95% CI): .61 (.56-.66)]. A reduced risk of progression to symptomatic MM was also observed [HR (95% CI): .82 (.69-.98)]. GLP-1 RA users had lower cumulative incidence of MI, HF, ischemic heart disease, and stroke; however, these differences were not confirmed in time-to-event analyses. GLP-1 RA therapy was associated with significantly improved PFS and OS in MGUS patients with metabolic comorbidities. While fewer cardiovascular events were observed, these findings were not statistically confirmed over time.",2025,Oct,European journal of clinical investigation,Anastasios Tentolouris; Ioannis Ntanasis-Stathopoulos; Charalampos Filippatos; Evangelos Terpos; Efstathios Kastritis; Ernesto Ruiz Duque; Meletios-Athanasios Dimopoulos; Maria Gavriatopoulou; Alexandros Briasoulis,1688,True,2025-10-01
39373093,Pharmaco-Economic Assessment of Screening Strategies for High-Risk MASLD in Primary Care.,"Several scientific associations recommend a sequential combination of non-invasive tests (NITs) to identify high-risk MASLD patients but their cost-effectiveness is unknown. A cost-utility model was developed to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of recommended screening strategies for patients with clinically suspected MASLD, specifically those with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity with multiple cardiometabolic risk factors which will be initiated in primary care. Six screening strategies were assessed, using either vibration-controlled transient elastography (VCTE) or the enhanced liver fibrosis (ELF) test as a second-line test following an initial Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) assessment as the first line NIT. The model included treatment effects of resmetirom for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) patients with F2 or F3 fibrosis. All screening strategies for high-risk MASLD in US incurred additional costs compared to no screening, ranging from $13 587 to $14 730 per patient with T2D and $14 274 to $15 661 per patient with obesity. However, screening reduced long-term costs, ranging from $22 150 to $22 279 per patient with T2D and $13 704 to $13 705 per patient with obesity, compared to $24 221 and $14 956 for no screening, respectively. ICERs ranged from $26 913 to $27 884 per QALY for T2D patients and $23 265 to $24  992 per QALY for patients with obesity. While ICERs were influenced by VCTE availability, they remained cost-effective when using ELF as the second-line test. Our findings remain robust across a range of key parameters. Screening for high-risk MASLD is cost-effective according to recent guidelines. Implementing these screening strategies in primary care should be considered.",2025,Apr,Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver,Zobair M Younossi; James M Paik; Linda Henry; Maria Stepanova; Fatema Nader,1753,True,2025-04-01
41128587,Developing a Sustainable Nursing Science Fellowship in an Academic Health System.,"Fostering a culture of inquiry within an academic health system can be both challenging and rewarding. Having a strategic approach can help navigate these complexities. The aim of this program evaluation is to describe the steps taken to develop, implement, and sustain a nursing science fellowship (NSF) in an academic health system. Grounded by a nursing strategic map, the NSF was established under the leadership of a steering committee. Key components of the NSF, including eligibility guidelines, curriculum development, outcome measurements, and faculty and mentor selection, were created over a three-month period. The first cohort of fellows began the 13-month program in January 2023. Fellows attended monthly lectures and were provided with individualized mentorship to advance either an evidence-based practice (EBP) or research project. Prior to beginning the curriculum, fellows were given a research/EBP textbook. A survey to determine their confidence in nursing science skills both before and after the program was administered to all fellows. Of the 11 inaugural fellows, eight completed the program. Four fellows conducted research studies, and four completed EBP projects. The results were disseminated through national presentations, posters, and peer-reviewed publications. Evaluations demonstrated significant improvements in the fellows' confidence in all measured nursing science skills and topics, with notable increases in navigating institutional review board submissions (148.54%), utilizing theoretical frameworks (86.92%), and critically appraising evidence (68.07%). A second cohort began the NSF program in September 2024, and a third will begin in 2026. The NSF helped to sustain a culture of inquiry within the academic health system. This program highlights the critical role of strategic planning and stakeholder engagement in advancing a culture of inquiry. The NSF fosters professional curiosity and aligns with the tenets of the American Nurses Credentialing Center Magnet model by advancing nursing science. As health care evolves, programs like the NSF are essential for cultivating sustainable nursing research and EBP practices that drive professional growth and innovation and can lead to enhanced patient care.",2025,Nov,The American journal of nursing,Debra Albert; Kathleen Evanovich Zavotsky; Barbara Delmore; Althea Mighten; Kurt Pinto; Patricia Lavin; Alice Nash; Benjamin Bass; Diane Maydick-Youngberg; Theresa Criscitelli; Joanna Marmo; Jennifer Withall,2257,True,2025-11-01
39586140,Liver metabolism in human MASLD: A review of recent advancements using human tissue metabolomics.,"Global incidence of Metabolic dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) is on the rise while treatments remain elusive. MASLD is a disease of dysregulated systemic and hepatic metabolism. Current understanding of disease pathophysiology as it relates to metabolome changes largely comes from studies on animal models and human plasma. However, human tissue data are crucial for transitioning from mechanisms to clinical therapies. The close relationship between MASLD and comorbidities like obesity, type 2 diabetes and dyslipidemia make it difficult to determine the contribution from liver disease itself. Here, we review recent metabolomics studies in liver tissue from human MASLD patients, which have predominately focused on lipid metabolism, but also include bile acid, tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and branched chain amino acid (BCAA) metabolism. Several clinical trials are underway to target various of these lipid-related pathways in MASLD. Although only the β-selective thyroid hormone receptor agonist resmetirom has so far been approved for use, many metabolism-targeting pharmaceuticals show promising results for halting disease progression, if not promoting outright reversal. Ultimately, the scarcity of human tissue data and the variability of confounding factors, like obesity, within and between cohorts are impediments to the pathophysiological understanding required for efficient development of metabolic treatments.",2025,Jan,Atherosclerosis,Emily Flam; Joel T Haas; Bart Staels,1457,True,2025-01-01
41145911,Highlights of Cardiovascular Disease Prevention Studies Presented at the 2025 European Society of Cardiology Conference.,"This review summarizes key findings from cardiovascular disease prevention studies presented at the 2025 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Conference. It highlights trials on novel therapies, vaccination, blood pressure management, and the use of technology and risk scores to guide treatment. The CONFIDENCE trial showed that a combination of finerenone and empagliflozin significantly reduced the urine albumin-creatinine ratio in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease. The DANFLU-2 trial found that the high-dose influenza vaccine was associated with fewer cardio-respiratory hospitalizations in older adults compared to the standard dose. The RETREAT FRAIL trial demonstrated that tapering antihypertensive medications in frail, elderly patients safely reduced pill burden without increasing all-cause mortality and adverse cardiovascular (CV) and non-CV outcomes. In diagnostics, the AI-Gatekeeper trial showed an AI tool reduced unnecessary advanced imaging for coronary artery disease (CAD) by 76%, lowering costs without compromising safety. The CAC CV-PREVITAL trial found that adding a coronary artery calcium score to standard risk assessment improved blood pressure control. The REBOOT-CNIC trial challenged a paradigm, showing that beta-blockers provided no significant benefit in post-myocardial infarction patients without reduced ejection fraction. A Post hoc analysis of SURMOUNT-5 found that tirzepatide offers a more pronounced long-term reduction in cardiovascular disease risk compared with semaglutide for adults with obesity and without diabetes. The NATURE-Legacy trial provided compelling evidence for the ""legacy benefit"" of early, modest reductions in LDL-C and blood pressure. The AIMHY-INFORM Dual Therapy Arm highlighted ethnic differences in blood pressure responses to dual therapy, while the OUTREACH trial demonstrated that providing feedback to patients on antihypertensive adherence using urine testing improved medication adherence. The 2025 ESC Conference featured several impactful studies on cardiovascular disease prevention, highlighting the importance of a multifaceted approach that incorporates the strategic integration of AI and a deeper understanding of patient-specific factors. As cardiovascular disease remains the leading global cause of death, these findings underscore the necessity of moving toward more personalized, evidence-based, and technologically-driven preventive care to improve patient outcomes and reduce the overall disease burden.",2025,Oct,Current atherosclerosis reports,Ali Bin Abdul Jabbar; Unaiza Naeem; Kalsoom Zulfiqar; Shahnoor Ahmed; Colin Hinkamp; Maha Inam; Abdul Mannan Khan Minhas; Leandro Slipczuk; Chayakrit Krittanawong; Amirhossein Sahebkar; Dinesh K Kalra; Salim S Virani,2530,True,2025-10-01
41078932,Atherosclerotic features in patients with heart failure.,"Heart failure (HF) and atherosclerosis represent two major cardiovascular diseases that are intricately linked, both contributing significantly to global morbidity, mortality, and healthcare burden. Despite substantial progress in diagnostic methods and therapeutic strategies, the overall impact of these conditions remains considerable. This is largely due to their complex and overlapping pathophysiological mechanisms, persistent residual atherosclerotic risk, and the ongoing challenges associated with implementing guideline-directed medical therapy for HF in routine clinical practice. Recent advancements in the management of diverse HF phenotypes, lipid abnormalities, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), and obesity have facilitated the adoption of multidrug regimens. These include β-blockers, renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors, sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors, and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), which have collectively improved outcomes in HF populations. Lipid-lowering therapy, particularly statins, has demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing ASCVD events and slowing HF progression, as well as lowering the risk of HF-related hospitalizations. Elevated lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] has emerged as an independent risk factor for both ASCVD and HF, being associated with increased risk of incident HF, disease progression, hospitalization, and adverse outcomes. However, there remains a lack of conclusive evidence as to whether targeted reduction of Lp(a) leads to a decrease in major adverse cardiovascular events or improves HF incidence or outcomes. In parallel, contemporary therapeutic advances in coronary and peripheral artery revascularization, along with novel pharmacologic treatments for obesity such as GLP-1 receptor agonists including semaglutide and tirzepatide have shown beneficial effects in reducing cardiovascular mortality, HF progression, and body weight, irrespective of HF status. These converging therapeutic strategies underscore the close interrelationship between HF and atherosclerosis. This review aims to elucidate the shared pathophysiological mechanisms linking these conditions and to examine their clinical overlap with ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, dyslipidemia, and obesity. A comprehensive understanding of these interrelated cardiovascular entities may offer valuable insights to inform future research directions and optimize the clinical management of patients affected by both HF and atherosclerotic disease.",2025,01,Archives of medical science : AMS,Alexandr Ceasovschih; Nikolina Banjanin; Anna Bednarek; Aldo Beqiraj; Maria Cherska; Malik Ejubović; Marta Jakubova; Sura Markos; Vladimir Ristovski; Roberto Scicali; Maciej Banach; Victorita Sorodoc; Antonio M Gotto,2561,True,2025-01-01
41098876,Economic Evaluation of Medications in Prevention and Treatment of Obesity: A Systematic Review.,"Obesity imposes a heavy burden on healthcare systems and society. Despite various treatment options, choosing cost-effective pharmacological interventions remains a key concern for health policymakers. This study systematically reviews economic evaluations of antiobesity drugs, comparing their costs and outcomes with those of lifestyle interventions. A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Four databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Embase) were searched for full economic evaluations of FDA-approved antiobesity drugs, including semaglutide, liraglutide, tirzepatide, phentermine-topiramate, and orlistat. Inclusion criteria required studies to report cost-effectiveness, cost-utility, or cost-benefit outcomes. Data on incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs), quality-adjusted life years (QALY), or disability-adjusted life years (DALY) were extracted and adjusted to 2024 USD using PPP. Study quality was assessed using CHEERS 2022. Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Most used Markov models and cost-effectiveness analyses. The review of articles showed that 60% of the articles were conducted in the United States of America, 33.33% of the articles in Europe, and 6.66% of the articles in Australia. Among the reviewed studies, semaglutide was found to be the most cost-effective and clinically effective drug in most scenarios. Phentermine-topiramate showed acceptable cost-effectiveness, particularly in low-resource settings. Orlistat and naltrexone-bupropion were also considered affordable options, though with lower effectiveness. Tirzepatide, despite its high efficacy, demonstrated a higher ICER, making its cost-effectiveness context-dependent. These findings highlight the importance of integrating cost-effective pharmacological treatments into obesity management strategies. Semaglutide appears to be a highly effective and economically favorable option, while phentermine-topiramate and orlistat offer practical alternatives in resource-limited settings. Economic evaluations can inform policy decisions and optimize healthcare resource allocation in combating obesity.",2025,01,International journal of preventive medicine,Somaye Afshari; Majid Khosravi; Mahmood Zamandi; Aziz Rezapour; Marziye Hadian; Aghdas Souresrafil; Elaheh Mazaheri; Nasrin Abolhasanbeigi Gallehzan,2211,True,2025-01-01
41071360,GLP-1 receptor agonists as an adjunct to bariatric surgery for weight loss and metabolic outcome improvement: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,"Glucagon-Like- Peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist has an emerging role in obesity management. This meta-analysis and systematic review evaluated the effectiveness of GLP-1 receptor agonists in aiding weight loss and enhancing cardiometabolic health in patients with insufficient weight loss (IWL) or weight regain (WR) after bariatric surgery.  A comprehensive literature search (PubMed, Medline, Embase, Cochrane) was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Included studies involved adults (≥18 years) treated with GLP-1 agonists either before or after bariatric surgery. Primary outcomes assessed were weight and BMI changes; secondary outcomes included metabolic improvements and adverse effects. 19 studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis. All included study involves at least one type of GLP-1 agonist for IWL or WR after bariatric surgery with duration of intervention between 3 months to 24 months. All studies showed significant weight and BMI changes from baseline after initiation of different types of GLP-1 agonist, with effects proportionate to length of intervention. Semaglutide outperformed liraglutide in achieving ≥10% and ≥15% weight loss post-surgery. Tirzepatide, a newer GLP-1/GIP agonist, showed even greater weight loss compared to semaglutide over 6 months. A systematic review of 6 studies on the metabolic effects of GLP-1 receptor agonists (RA) post-bariatric surgery highlighted significant improvements in glycemic control, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and liver function. Adverse effects were mostly mild gastrointestinal symptoms with no severe events reported. GLP-1 agonists have emerged as a promising alternative to revisional surgery for patients experiencing insufficient weight loss (IWL) or weight regain (WR) after bariatric surgery. Tirzepatide, the newest GLP-1 /GIP agonist, has shown superior results compared to liraglutide and semaglutide. However, more long-term randomized controlled trials are needed to confirm these findings and further assess its effectiveness. Despite this, GLP-1 agonists consistently demonstrate significant weight loss and cardiometabolic improvements when compared to placebo or lifestyle modifications, making them a valuable treatment option for post-bariatric surgery patients.

Currently, corticosteroids and alcohol abstinence remain the only available strategy to prevent or reverse ASH progression with no FDA approved drug therapy till date. Given the notable pathological similarities between ASH and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), repurposing drugs approved for MASH presents an attractive therapeutic approach to treat ASH. In this context, we evaluated the efficacy of Resmetirom, a recently approved drug for MASH, in a mouse model of ASH. Our findings demonstrate that Resmetirom, a liver-specific thyroid hormone analog, not only reduces hepatic steatosis but also markedly alleviates liver injury, oxidative stress, and inflammation associated with ASH. In summary, this study provides a proof-of-concept for the potential use of MASH drugs in treating ASH and establishes a foundation for future testing and clinical trials of Resmetirom, in patients with ASH.",2024,Nov,Biochemical and biophysical research communications,Ambuj Shahi; Abhishek Yadav; Sangam Rajak; Sana Raza; Archana Tewari; Pratima Gupta; Rohit A Sinha,1104,True,2024-11-01
41121618,LGALS3BP Induces Insulin Resistance via TLR2-IKKα/β Pathway-Mediated IRS1 Serine Phosphorylation.,"Insulin resistance (IR) disrupts hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism, contributing to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and progression to severe liver complications. Galectin-3-binding protein (LGALS3BP) is a secreted glycoprotein implicated in inflammation and metabolic disorders. Elevated LGALS3BP levels are associated with MASLD and type 2 diabetes (T2D), but its role in IR remains unclear. LGALS3BP-deficient models were used to investigate its role in IR and inflammation. Glucose metabolism and insulin signaling were assessed in high-fat diet (HFD)-fed mice. Hepatic cell lines were employed to evaluate the direct effects of LGALS3BP on insulin signaling and inflammation. Mechanistic insights were obtained through RNA sequencing, structural modeling, immunoprecipitation, and protein/gene expression analyses. LGALS3BP deficiency improved insulin sensitivity in HFD-fed mice by enhancing glucose tolerance, lowering serum glucose and insulin, and increasing hepatic insulin signaling, without altering lipid accumulation. In vitro, LGALS3BP deficiency enhanced insulin signaling and suppressed gluconeogenesis, whereas recombinant LGALS3BP impaired insulin signaling and upregulated gluconeogenesis. RNA sequencing revealed activation of Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathways by LGALS3BP. Immunoprecipitation confirmed a direct interaction between LGALS3BP and TLR2, leading to inhibitor kappa kinase (IKK)/NF-κB activation and increased insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS1) serine phosphorylation, a key inhibitory modification in IR. Furthermore, LGALS3BP deficiency attenuated hepatic fibrosis under chronic HFD, accompanied by downregulated inflammatory signaling pathways. LGALS3BP contributes to IR through inflammatory responses, particularly via TLR2-IKKα/β signaling that regulates IRS1 serine phosphorylation. LGALS3BP deficiency improves insulin sensitivity and reduces inflammation, suggesting that targeting LGALS3BP may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for metabolic disorders such as T2D and MASLD.",2025,Oct,"Endocrinology and metabolism (Seoul, Korea)",Minjeong Sung; Dae-Hwan Kim; Eun-Gene Sun; Jun-Eul Hwang; Sang-Hee Cho; Ik-Joo Chung; Hyun-Jeong Shim; Woo Kyun Bae,2103,True,2025-10-01
41086442,ANTI-INFLAMMATORY PROPERTIES OF GLP-1 RECEPTOR AGONISTS AND OTHER ANCILLARY BENEFITS FROM A PHARMACOLOGICAL PERSPECTIVE.,"Incretin-based therapies, particularly glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), exert a wide range of beneficial effects beyond glycemic control, largely mediated by their anti-inflammatory properties. Chronic low-grade inflammation is a common pathological mechanism underlying metabolic, cardiovascular, hepatic, and neurodegenerative diseases. GLP-1RAs reduce systemic and tissue-specific inflammation through both direct and indirect mechanisms, including inhibition of NF-kB signaling, reduction of proinflammatory cytokines, and modulation of immune cell activity, such as that of macrophages and microglia. In type 2 diabetes and obesity, GLP-1RAs improve insulin sensitivity and endothelial function by attenuating inflammation. In metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, GLP-1RAs reduce hepatic steatosis and fibrosis by modulating inflammation in hepatocytes and Kupffer cells. In cardiovascular disease, they mitigate atherosclerosis progression and improve vascular health. GLP-1RAs also exert direct nephroprotective effects by reducing renal inflammation, oxidative stress, and glomerular hyperfiltration in both diabetic and non-diabetic models. GLP-RAs have been also associated with the preservation of cognitive and motor function. Preclinical studies suggest that these neuroprotective effects may involve the attenuation of neuroinflammation and reduced aggregation of pathological proteins. Overall, these pleiotropic actions position incretin-based therapies as promising tools for the management of complex chronic diseases with an inflammatory component.",2025,Oct,Canadian journal of physiology and pharmacology,Inmaculada Ros-Madrid; Rosario Paloma Cano-Mármol; Mercedes Ferrer-Gómez; Bruno Ramos-Molina,1610,True,2025-10-01

This review combines molecular mechanisms with clinical evidence to demonstrate how GLP-1 agonists help lower cardiovascular risk for conditions, including atherosclerosis, heart failure, stroke, and vascular dementia. These agents produce multiple beneficial effects, which include anti-inflammatory action along with anti-atherogenic effects, endothelial-protective benefits, and cardioprotective actions to minimize major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs). GLP-1 agonists achieved substantial reductions in myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality, and heart failure events according to major cardiovascular outcome trials (CVOTs). Recent research, notably the pivotal SELECT trial, has confirmed their suitability for non-diabetic subjects with obesity and established CVD. New drug delivery methods and dual GLP-1/glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) agonists demonstrate potent efficacy, with tirzepatide showing significant MACE reduction in its own CVOT. However, significant challenges related to high cost, long-term safety uncertainties, and implementation barriers remain, requiring a balanced perspective.

41152797,Inappropriate GFR equations misrepresent CKD epidemiology and risk interpretation in scientific reports.,"The accuracy of chronic kidney disease (CKD) prevalence and its associations with metabolic risk factors depends heavily on the formula used to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). In Iran, many epidemiologic studies still rely on outdated equations, which may distort epidemiologic findings and misinform public health estimates. We analyzed 9,911 adults from the Fasa Adult Cohort Study (FACS) at baseline and 2,977 at 5-year follow-up. eGFR was calculated using Cockcroft-Gault, MDRD, and CKD-EPI 2021 equations. CKD was defined as eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m². Associations of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and the fatty liver index (FLI) with CKD prevalence and incidence were examined using logistic regression, with polynomial regression applied for continuous eGFR outcomes. At baseline, mean eGFR varied substantially by equation (Cockcroft-Gault: 80.7 ± 20.6; MDRD: 71.0 ± 11.1; CKD-EPI: 82.7 ± 13.3). CKD prevalence was estimated at 15.1% with Cockcroft-Gault, 14.5% with MDRD, but only 3.5% with CKD-EPI (χ² p < 0.001). Similar discrepancies were observed for 5-year incidence (23.0%, 29.5%, and 9.9%, respectively; χ² p < 0.001). In longitudinal analyses, MASLD was associated with higher CKD risk when using CKD-EPI (OR 1.35, 95%CI 1.01-1.79) and MDRD (OR 1.32, 95%CI 1.08-1.62), but lower CKD risk with Cockcroft-Gault (OR:0.10,95%CI:0.08-0.13,p < 0.001). Continuous analyses showed the same directionally inconsistent associations between FLI and eGFR depending on the equation used. The choice of GFR estimating equation substantially alters CKD prevalence estimates and the observed relationships with MASLD. CKD-EPI 2021 produced results consistent with biological plausibility and guideline recommendations. For accurate epidemiology, public health planning, and international comparability, researchers in Iran and globally should adopt the most updated eGFR equations.

A 70-year-old female was admitted with epigastric pain that began a week before admission. One month prior, she was hospitalized for chest pain and diagnosed with a left anterior descending artery occlusion, requiring a 3-vessel CABG. The pharmacy transitions of care service discovered that during her prior stay, she missed 2 doses of dulaglutide and resumed it at the previous dose of 4.5 mg on discharge. After a comprehensive workup, she was diagnosed with gastritis. Her pain improved over the course of 4 days, and she was discharged with instructions to hold the dulaglutide upon discharge and consult her primary care physician for re-titration.

40022548,The promise of glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) for the treatment of obesity: a look at phase 2 and 3 pipelines.,"GLP-1-based therapies have changed the treatment of overweight/obesity. Liraglutide 3.0 mg daily, the first GLP-1 RA approved for treatment of overweight, induced a weight loss of 6-8%, Semaglutide 2.4 mg once weekly improved weight loss to about 12-15%, while the dual GIP/GLP-1 receptor agonist tirzepatide once weekly has induced a weight loss of about 20% in obese people without diabetes. This review describes results obtained with GLP-1 mono-agonists, GLP-1/GIP dual agonists, GLP-1/glucagon co-agonists, and the triple agonist retatrutide (GIP/GLP-1/glucagon), which have shown beneficial effect both on body weight and steatotic liver disease. A combination of semaglutide (a GLP-1 agonist) and cagrilintide (a long-acting amylin analogue) for weekly administration is currently in phase III development, and so is oral semaglutide and several non-peptide small molecule GLP-1 agonists for oral administration. The adverse events with the GLP-1-based therapies are primarily gastrointestinal and include nausea, vomiting, obstipation, or diarrhea, which often can be mitigated by slow up titration. The GLP-1-based therapies will change the treatment of obesity and its comorbidities including steatotic liver disease in the future. Outstanding question is maintenance of the weight loss, possibly pharmacological treatment needs to be life-long.",2025,Mar,Expert opinion on investigational drugs,Sten Madsbad; Jens J Holst,1356,True,2025-03-01
41143740,Genotypic and phenotypic characterization of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei HP-B1337 associated with lipotropic effect on high-fat-diet-induced obesity mice.,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a prevalent chronic liver condition, affecting 25% of adults globally, with risks of progression to severe complications such as cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Emerging evidence highlights gut microbiota dysbiosis in NAFLD pathogenesis, suggesting probiotics as promising interventions. This study aimed to evaluate the potential of Lacticaseibacillus paracasei HP-B1337 as a probiotic for NAFLD management through phenotypic, genotypic analyses, and in-vivo mouse model. The strain Lacticaseibacillus paracasei HP-B1337 was identified using colony morphology, physiological and biochemical characterization, carbon utilization tests, and whole-genome sequencing. Its safety profile was assessed via minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) testing, genotype-based antibiotic resistance analysis, biogenic amine production assays, and genetic screening for virulence and pathogenic factors. Probiotic properties, including acid and bile salt tolerance, antimicrobial activity against pathogens, adhesion capacity, and beneficial gene identification, were investigated. Additionally, the anti-NAFLD potential of HP-B1337 was validated in a high-fat diet (HFD)-induced mouse model. The results demonstrated that HP-B1337 exhibits robust probiotic characteristics, a favorable safety profile, and significant efficacy in alleviating HFD-induced fatty liver disease in mice. Findings of this study provide strong evidence supporting the candidacy of HP-B1337 as a probiotic for NAFLD management.",2025,Oct,Journal of applied microbiology,Lan- Fang Li; Zhi-Wen Tan; Yu-Rui Wang; Xiang-Rui Mao; Jin-Xiu Jiang; Ran-Ran Liu; Hang Wu; Shao-Yang Hou,1544,True,2025-10-01

Here a Medline and Embase search was performed up to 31 January 2025 for randomized controlled trials comparing OMMs versus placebo/active comparators in adults. Primary endpoint was percentage of total body weight loss (TBWL%) at the end of the study. Secondary endpoints were TBWL% at 1, 2 and ≥3 years, lipid profile, blood pressure, hemoglobin A1c, fasting plasma glucose, mental health, serious adverse events, quality of life, cardiovascular morbidity and mortality, remission of obesity-related complications and all-cause mortality. Fifty-six clinical trials were identified-orlistat (22), semaglutide (14), liraglutide (11), tirzepatide (6), naltrexone/bupropion (5) and phentermine/topiramate (2)-enrolling 60,307 patients (32,598 OMM and 27,709 placebo). All OMMs showed a significantly greater TBWL% versus placebo (P < 0.0001), more than 10% for semaglutide and tirzepatide. Both tirzepatide and semaglutide showed normoglycemia restoration, remission of type 2 diabetes and reduction in hospitalization due to heart failure. Semaglutide was effective in reducing major adverse cardiovascular events and reducing pain in knee osteoarthritis. Tirzepatide was effective in remission of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.

However, comparative outcomes data remain limited. This retrospective cohort study followed the strengthening the reporting of observational studies in epidemiology recommendations for reporting observational studies. We analyzed 90 patients who underwent breast reduction surgery from 2020 to 2024, stratified into three matched groups: GLP-1 receptor agonist users (n = 30), post-bariatric surgery patients (n = 30), and controls (n = 30). Patients were matched based on age, body mass index, and comorbidity profile. Complications were classified as major complications (requiring reoperation) and overall complications (any intervention required). Major complication rates were low across all groups: controls 0/30 (0%), GLP-1 users 2/30 (6.7%), and post-bariatric patients 2/30 (6.7%, p = 0.368). Overall complications requiring any intervention differed significantly (p < 0.001): controls 3/30 (10.0%), GLP-1 users 7/30 (23.3%), and post-bariatric patients 19/30 (63.3%). Seroma formation varied markedly: controls 1/30 (3.3%), GLP-1 users 5/30 (16.7%), and post-bariatric patients 9/30 (30.0%, p=0.008). Skin necrosis occurred exclusively in post-bariatric patients (4/30, 13.3%, p = 0.041). Multivariable analysis identified hypoalbuminemia (OR 8.5, p = 0.005) and post-bariatric status (OR 15.6, p < 0.001) as independent risk factors. Preoperative albumin levels were significantly lower in post-bariatric patients (3.5 ± 0.2 g/dL) versus GLP-1 users (4.0±0.2 g/dL) and controls (4.2±0.2 g/dL, p < 0.001). Post-bariatric surgery patients demonstrated significantly higher complication rates compared to GLP-1 users and controls. Hypoalbuminemia and post-bariatric status emerged as independent risk factors for complications.

38680683,Hormone-based pharmacotherapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) has reached epidemic proportions globally in parallel to the rising prevalence of obesity. Despite its significant burden, there is no approved pharmacotherapy specifically tailored for this disease. Many potential drug candidates for MAFLD have encountered setbacks in clinical trials, due to safety concerns or/and insufficient therapeutic efficacy. Nonetheless, several investigational drugs that mimic the actions of endogenous metabolic hormones, including thyroid hormone receptor β (THRβ) agonists, fibroblast growth factor 21 (FGF21) analogues, and glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs), showed promising therapeutic efficacy and excellent safety profiles. Among them, resmetirom, a liver-targeted THRβ-selective agonist, has met the primary outcomes in alleviation of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the advanced form of MAFLD, and liver fibrosis in phase-3 clinical trials. These hormone-based pharmacotherapies not only exhibit varied degrees of therapeutic efficacy in mitigating hepatic steatosis, inflammation and fibrosis, but also improve metabolic profiles. Furthermore, these three hormonal agonists/analogues act in a complementary manner to exert their pharmacological effects, suggesting their combined therapies may yield synergistic therapeutic benefits. Further in-depth studies on the intricate interplay among these metabolic hormones are imperative for the development of more efficacious combination therapies, enabling precision management of MAFLD and its associated comorbidities.",2024,Apr,Medical review (2021),Zara Siu Wa Chui; Yaqian Xue; Aimin Xu,1613,True,2024-04-01
41161771,Effects of Resmetirom on Resistance to Thyroid Hormone Receptor Mutants: Potential Basis for Therapeutic Applications.,"Resistance to thyroid hormone-β (RTHβ) is caused by mutations in thyroid hormone receptors (TRs), with palpitations, tachycardia, and/or goiter being the most frequently reported clinical features. In recent years, several synthetic thyromimetics have been developed to target mutations associated with RTHβ. Resmetirom, which was granted an accelerated approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is a TRβ-agonist for the first line therapy for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. This study aimed to evaluate the potential mechanisms of action of resmetirom on RTHβ through co-factors and association with clinical manifestations. We selected cases from 13 clinical records based on recently reported domestic cases in Japan. Based on these clinical reports, we conducted screenings using clinical symptoms, laboratory findings, and mutation data. We attempted to unveil the interaction between 26 RTHβ mutants and resmetirom focusing on recruitment of co-factors. Among the 26 probands, dominant-negative effects (DNE) were identified in 12 mutant TRs (48.5 ± 11.8%). Resmetirom was involved in the recruitment of the co-activators, steroid receptor coactivator-1 and glucocorticoid receptor-interacting protein-1, as well as the co-repressors (CoRs), nuclear-CoR and silencing mediator of retinoic acid and TR. Co-factor recruitment by resmetirom was detected in all mutants. In eight patients with DNE, an association between transcriptional activity and clinical symptoms was observed, which were the reasons for clinical investigation. Notably, in the helix-12 mutant-P453, mild induction of DNE was associated with the recruitment of CoRs, suggesting that resmetirom may be effective in alleviating subjective symptoms in mutants with attenuated DNE located in helix-12.",2025,01,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,Mana Mitsutani; Hiromi Hano; Mei Yokoyama; Midori Matsushita; Tetsuya Tagami; Kenji Moriyama,1800,True,2025-01-01

Here, we developed an organ-on-a-chip platform featuring a microfluidic chip with scaffolds of a closed-packed porous structure to recapitulate the characteristics of the gut-islets axis for bile acid (BA) evaluation. The scaffolds were fabricated by negative replication of assembled droplet templates, enabling intestinal L-cells and pancreatic β-cells to form uniform spheroids. The scaffolds were embedded within a well-designed cascading microfluidic chip capable of generating a concentration gradient. Through this, the assessment of different concentrations of BAs in promoting GLP-1 and insulin secretion was achieved, with results consistent with previous studies, indicating the high accuracy of our platform.

During the last decade, certain glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA), originally developed as antihyperglycemic drugs, also demonstrated efficacy for weight loss. To review shared pathophysiologic features of common metabolic diseases and compare therapeutic strategies to reduce body weight and related complications. We performed an extensive literature research to describe the effects of lifestyle modification, first-generation anti-obesity drugs, and GLP-1RA on weight loss in humans with obesity, type 2 diabetes and MASLD. Until recently, treatment of obesity has been limited to lifestyle modification, which offer moderate degree and sustainability of weight loss. The few approved first-generation anti-obesity drugs are either limited to short term use or to certain forms of obesity. Some GLP-1RA significantly decrease caloric intake and body weight. Liraglutide and semaglutide have therefore been approved for treating people with obesity. They also lead to a reduction of hepatic fat content and inflammation in people with biopsy-confirmed MASLD. Possible limitations comprise adverse effects, treatment adherence and persistence. Certain GLP-1RA are superior to lifestyle modification and first-generation anti-obesity drugs in inducing weight loss. They have therefore markedly changed the portfolio of obesity treatment with additional beneficial effects on steatotic liver disease.",2024,Jun,Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics,Anna Giannakogeorgou; Michael Roden,1606,True,2024-06-01
39199152,Altered Mitochondrial Function in MASLD: Key Features and Promising Therapeutic Approaches.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), formerly known as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), encompasses a range of liver conditions from steatosis to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). Its prevalence, especially among patients with metabolic syndrome, highlights its growing global impact. The pathogenesis of MASLD involves metabolic dysregulation, inflammation, oxidative stress, genetic factors and, notably, mitochondrial dysfunction. Recent studies underscore the critical role of mitochondrial dysfunction in MASLD's progression. Therapeutically, enhancing mitochondrial function has gained interest, along with lifestyle changes and pharmacological interventions targeting mitochondrial processes. The FDA's approval of resmetirom for metabolic-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) with fibrosis marks a significant step. While resmetirom represents progress, further research is essential to understand MASLD-related mitochondrial dysfunction fully. Innovative strategies like gene editing and small-molecule modulators, alongside lifestyle interventions, can potentially improve MASLD treatment. Drug repurposing and new targets will advance MASLD therapy, addressing its increasing global burden. Therefore, this review aims to provide a better understanding of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in MASLD and identify more effective preventive and treatment strategies.",2024,Jul,"Antioxidants (Basel, Switzerland)",Tatjana Radosavljevic; Milica Brankovic; Janko Samardzic; Jasmina Djuretić; Dusan Vukicevic; Danijela Vucevic; Vladimir Jakovljevic,1417,True,2024-07-01
41075914,Exendin-4 improves mitochondrial integrity against cisplatin-induced cardiac damage: Targeting p53 and NF-κB pathways.,"Heart failure is a devastating consequence of chemotherapy, with mitochondrial dysfunction playing a key role in cardiac damage. Cisplatin (CP), a widely used chemotherapeutic agent, induces cardiotoxicity by increasing apoptosis and triggering inflammation. This study provides evidence that exendin-4 (Ex-4), a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonist, exerts cardioprotective effects in H9c2 cardiomyoblasts against CP-induced injury. Ex-4 administration markedly restored mitochondrial bioenergetics, as evidenced by improved oxygen consumption and extracellular acidification rates, while preserving mitochondrial morphology and reversing fragmentation caused by CP. The observed effects were correlated with upregulation of markers involved in mitochondrial biogenesis (PGC1α, NRF1, ATP5A) and fusion process (OPA1, MFN1), accompanied by downregulation of mitochondrial fission markers (DNM1, FIS1). Ex-4 attenuated intracellular and mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels, repressed caspase-3/7 activity, and shifted apoptotic balance by enhancing Bcl-2 levels while diminishing BAX expression. Moreover, Ex-4 suppressed CP-triggered inflammatory responses by reducing TNFα and IL6 levels. Mechanistically, Ex-4 activated pro-survival signals (p-Akt and p-Erk1/2) and exerted cardioprotective effects through inhibition of p53 and NF-κB-dependent cascades. Pharmacological inhibition of p53 (pifithrin-α) or NF-κB (JSH-23) further amplified the protective effect of Ex-4 against CP-induced mitochondrial abnormalities, apoptosis, and inflammation, whereas activation of p53 (nutlin-3) or NF-κB (NF-κB activator 1) reversed these protective outcomes. Thus, Ex-4 emerges as a potent modulator of mitochondrial dysfunction and cellular stress through suppression of the p53 and NF-κB pathways, offering a promising therapeutic approach to mitigate CP-induced cardiotoxicity.",2025,Oct,European journal of pharmacology,Hnin Ei Ei Khine; Supachoke Mangmool; Warisara Parichatikanond,1899,True,2025-10-01
41093047,Hypothalamic regulation of obesity: Revealing the therapeutic potential of a novel anti-obesity peptide.,"Obesity is a chronic, complex condition defined by excessive fat buildup due to an imbalance between caloric consumption and energy expenditure. The significant global rise in prevalence of obesity is associated with numerous comorbidities, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. Conventional management approaches, including diet, exercise, pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery, may demonstrate restricted long-term effectiveness owing to inadequate adherence and physiological adjustments. Recent advancements in neuroscience underscore the hypothalamus as a pivotal regulator of energy balance via essential nuclei, including the arcuate nucleus (ARC), paraventricular nucleus (PVN), lateral hypothalamic area (LHA), and ventromedial nucleus (VMN). This review examines the therapeutic potential of a new anti-obesity peptide that targets hypothalamic signalling pathways. Preclinical and clinical evidence endorses the utilization of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists and novel multi-receptor drugs such as AMG 133, which integrate GLP-1R activation with glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR) antagonism. These therapies exhibit improved weight reduction and metabolic enhancement. Moreover, the integration of hypothalamic peptide therapy with lifestyle modifications or post-bariatric care provides synergistic advantages. Notwithstanding favorable results, peptide therapy encounters obstacles such as administration methods, sustained effectiveness, and expense. Overcoming these obstacles is crucial for the effective implementation of peptide-based treatments in sustained clinical obesity control.",2025,Oct,Vascular pharmacology,Yi Ning Choo; Ram Narayanan; Vetriselvan Subramaniyan,1700,True,2025-10-01

40536520,Semaglutide versus other GLP-1 receptor agonists in patients with MASLD.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is the most prevalent chronic liver disease worldwide. While glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RAs) show promise in MASLD treatment, the comparative effectiveness of semaglutide versus other GLP-1RAs remains unclear. This study aimed to compare clinical outcomes between semaglutide and other GLP-1RAs in patients with MASLD. Using the TriNetX Research Network database, we conducted a retrospective cohort study of patients with MASLD newly prescribed GLP-1RAs between December 2017 and September 2023. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality, major adverse cardiovascular events, major adverse kidney events, and major adverse liver outcomes. Secondary outcomes included the individual components of the primary outcome. After propensity score matching, 20,384 patients were included in each group. Compared to other GLP-1RAs, semaglutide was associated with a 14% lower risk of primary composite outcomes (31.8 vs. 36.6 events per 10,000 person-years; adjusted HR, 0.86; 95% CI: 0.80-0.93). Semaglutide users showed significantly reduced risks of all-cause mortality (aHR, 0.68; 95% CI: 0.59-0.80) and major adverse liver outcomes (aHR, 0.79; 95% CI: 0.66-0.94). Benefits were consistent across subgroups, including age, sex, obesity status, and diabetes status. Comparative analyses showed superior outcomes with semaglutide versus dulaglutide (aHR, 0.88; 95% CI: 0.81-0.96) and liraglutide (aHR, 0.83; 95% CI: 0.71-0.97). In patients with MASLD, semaglutide use was associated with significantly better clinical outcomes compared to other GLP-1RAs, particularly in reducing mortality and major adverse liver outcome risks.

Current therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic abnormalities have shown promise but lack specificity for the liver. Thyroid hormones, particularly thyroid hormone receptor beta (THR-β) agonists like resmetirom, offer a targeted approach to liver-related pathways. A network meta-analysis (NMA) comparing different doses of resmetirom to placebo for MASLD and MASH was conducted.

Efficacy outcomes included histological, radiological, and biochemical parameters, while safety outcomes comprised adverse events and treatment discontinuation. Resmetirom demonstrated dose-dependent efficacy in histological and radiological assessments, with the 100 mg dose showing superior MASH resolution and hepatic fat reduction. Biochemical markers indicated improved liver function with resmetirom treatment. However, adverse events, particularly diarrhea and nausea, were more prevalent in the resmetirom group, leading to higher treatment discontinuation rates.

Sixty-nine individuals with and without anxiety disorders or PTSD completed a modified no (N), predictable (P), and unpredictable (U) (NPU) threat task during a 7T functional MRI scan. Anxious arousal was measured using the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire anxious arousal subscale. Individual data-driven LC segmentations were derived from ultra-high-resolution magnetization transfer contrast scans. We conducted LC functional activation and whole-brain data analyses during the NPU task using both transdiagnostic (Research Domain Criteria-based) and categorical (DSM-5-based) approaches. Greater LC activation during unpredictable threat was positively correlated with anxious arousal across all participants. In whole-brain analyses, the posterior cingulate cortex/precuneus and the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex were significantly activated during unpredictable threat, whereas the posterior insula was significantly activated during predictable threat. Greater activation within key structures of the threat circuitry, including the brainstem, the left hippocampus/amygdala, and the insula was positively correlated with anxious arousal across conditions and participants. This translational and dimensional work advances our understanding of the role of the LC system and threat circuitry in pathological anxiety. Using 7T MRI, this study highlights the functional role of the LC in processing unpredictable threat in association with anxious arousal in individuals with anxiety disorders and PTSD.

This double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial aimed to report the effects of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonist, semaglutide, on HRQoL in patients with NASH as a secondary endpoint. Adults with biopsy-proven NASH and stage 1-3 fibrosis were randomised (3:3:3:1:1:1) to once-daily subcutaneous semaglutide 0.1, 0.2 or 0.4 mg, or placebo, for 72 weeks.

39038768,Expert Panel Recommendations: Practical Clinical Applications for Initiating and Monitoring Resmetirom in Patients With MASH/NASH and Moderate to Noncirrhotic Advanced Fibrosis.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease affects 1 in 4 people in the United States and western Europe, with an important proportion developing metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the progressive subtype of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease. Cirrhosis caused by MASH is a leading indication for liver transplantation and the most common cause of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hitherto, there have been no specific pharmacotherapies for MASH. The recent conditional approval by the Food and Drug Administration of resmetirom for the treatment of moderate or advanced MASH presents a much-anticipated therapeutic option for patients with noncirrhotic advanced MASH. Specifically, the intended population for resmetirom are patients with MASH and fibrosis stages 2 or 3. The approval of resmetirom also presents important challenges, including how to noninvasively identify patients with fibrosis stages 2-3, and how to exclude patients with more advanced disease who should not be treated until further data emerge on the use of resmetirom in this population. Herein we consider the available literature with regard to identifying the intended population for treatment with resmetirom and in proposing criteria for stopping treatment.",2024,Dec,Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association,Mazen Noureddin; Michael R Charlton; Stephen A Harrison; Meena B Bansal; Naim Alkhouri; Rohit Loomba; Arun J Sanyal; Mary E Rinella,1289,True,2024-12-01

40301009,Resmetirom Is an Effective Thyromimetics for the Chemical Rescue of Thyroid Hormone Receptor Mutants.,"Thyroid hormone receptors (TRs) predominantly consist of three isoforms: TRβ1, TRβ2, and TRα1. Mutations in TRs that reduce or eliminate their ligand-dependent functions lead to a condition known as resistance to thyroid hormone (RTH), which is a genetic disorder caused in an autosomal-dominant manner. Recently, resmetirom, a selective TRβ agonist, has showen significant promise and was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration as the first drug for the treatment of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis and liver fibrosis. In this study, we performed a series of assays to determine how different mutations retain the activity of resmetirom in presumed clinical practice to screen patients based on previously published 15 studies. We generated and examined the transcriptional activation of 57 mutant TRβs, to evaluate the therapeutic potential of resmetirom in treating these mutations. Resmetirom functions as a partial agonist for TRβ and has been found to recruit and interact with all cofactors, albeit significantly less effectively than T3. Consequently, our results suggest that some residues in helices 1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 10, and 11 of TRβ, are still susceptible to resmetirom binding. However, mutants of helix 12, which forms part of the dimerization interface used to bind transcriptional coactivators, are non-responsive to resmetirom. While certain mutants do not respond to lower concentrations of resmetirom, some can be rescued when higher concentrations are applied. In clinical applications, resmetirom can contribute to RTH without considering the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of thyroid-stimulating hormones by the negatively regulated gene.",2025,01,Biological & pharmaceutical bulletin,Mana Mitsutani; Mei Yokoyama; Hiromi Hano; Aoi Morita; Midori Matsushita; Tetsuya Tagami; Kenji Moriyama,1701,True,2025-01-01
39654073,An exploratory analysis of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) agonists and biosimilars: A literature review.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) are at the forefront of treating the global health crisis of diabetes mellitus (DM) and obesity. However, the demand for GLP-1 RAs has far outstripped its supply and comes with a high monthly cost. Thus, the development of GLP-1 RA biosimilars can potentially address these barriers by providing greater access to medications that provide clinical outcomes similar to those of the reference products. A narrative review was conducted to examine the current and future developments for GLP-1 RA biosimilars. Liraglutide and semaglutide are the predominant GLP-1 RAs being investigated for the development of biosimilars. Preliminary liraglutide biosimilar comparisons to reference liraglutide have demonstrated similar clinical efficacy and safety profiles. Semaglutide and beinaglutide biosimilars are currently under investigation as well. With the growing popularity of GLP-1 RAs, accessibility and affordability remain a challenge as monthly costs without insurance for liraglutide, semaglutide and tirzepatide are $1418, $892, and $974 respectively. This trend negatively impacts patients with obesity and DM as well as patients who can utilize it for off-label indications for conditions that benefit from weight loss such as obstructive sleep apnoea and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease. A substantial number of pharmaceutical and healthcare companies worldwide are conducting clinical trials on their GLP-1 RA biosimilars. Preliminary results from liraglutide biosimilars are promising, and several semaglutide biosimilars are currently being investigated.

We investigated the correlation of biomarkers such as AST-to-platelet ratio index (APRI), Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4), and liver stiffness measurement (LSM) from FibroScan with severity of fibrosis on liver biopsy in children with liver disease. We performed a retrospective analysis of children who underwent FibroScan. Advanced liver disease (aLD) was defined as fibrosis score 3-4 on liver biopsy. A total of 1004 children were included in this analysis. The two most common diagnoses were metabolic associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) 658 (65.5 %) with liver biopsies in 136 (20.6 %), and liver transplant (LT) 74 (7.4 %) with liver biopsies in 45 (60.8 %). The APRI, FIB-4, and LSM were significantly correlated with fibrosis scores (Pearson correlation 0.25, p = 0.006, 0.19, p = 0.04, 0.50, p < 0.001, respectively) in MASLD. In LT, or autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), only LSM had significant correlation with fibrosis score. LSM greater than 8.5 kPa predicted aLD in MASLD, LT, and AIH. LSM, APRI, and FIB-4 did not change significantly during the approximate annual follow-up. LSM correlates better with aLD than APRI and FIB-4 on liver biopsy in children with MASLD, LT, and AIH.

This study investigated the Bacteroides eggerthii therapeutic effects on MASLD by integrating multi-omics analysis and experimental validation in a Western diet-induced mouse model. Candidate strains were identified using 16S rRNA gene sequencing of fecal samples from individuals with and without MASLD or obesity. B. eggerthii, a species significantly depleted in both groups, was selected for functional evaluation. Male C57BL/6J mice were fed a Western diet (WD) or WD supplemented with B. eggerthii (WD+B) for 12 weeks. Liver histology, serum biochemistry, fecal microbiome and metabolome profiling, and hepatic and intestinal transcriptomic analyses were performed. Anti-steatotic effects of B. eggerthii-derived metabolites were validated in vitro. Bacteroides eggerthii supplementation significantly improved liver weight, inflammation, fibrosis, and steatosis in WD+B group compared to WD alone. PICRUSt-based LEfSe analysis revealed choloylglycine hydrolase activity enrichment in gut microbiota, and strain-specific qPCR confirmed colonization in mouse colon. Integrated transcriptomic analyses revealed lipid and bile acid signaling pathway restoration, including CD36, FXR, and FGF15. Untargeted metabolomics identified elevated 2-hydroxyisocaproic acid (HICA) as a strain-derived metabolite in feces and B. eggerthii culture supernatants. In vitro, HICA significantly reduced lipid accumulation in free fatty acid-induced steatosis models. Bacteroides eggerthii ameliorates MASLD via gut-liver axis modulation, including bile acid metabolism and hepatic lipid signaling.

37313239,"Resmetirom: An Orally Administered, Smallmolecule, Liver-directed, β-selective THR Agonist for the Treatment of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease and Non-alcoholic Steatohepatitis.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) encompasses a spectrum of fatty liver disease, including non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) and its more progressive form, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). The prevalence of NAFLD/NASH along with type 2 diabetes and obesity is rising worldwide. In those who develop NASH, unlike those with bland steatosis (NAFL), lipotoxic lipids drive hepatocyte injury, inflammation and stellate cell activation leading to progressive accumulation of collagen or fibrosis, ultimately leading to cirrhosis and increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Hypothyroidism is associated with NAFLD/NASH; specifically, intrahepatic hypothyroidism drives lipotoxicty in preclinical models. Agonists of thyroid hormone receptor (THR)-β, which is primarily found in the liver, can promote lipophagy, mitochondrial biogenesis and mitophagy, stimulating increased hepatic fatty acid β-oxidation, and thereby decreasing the burden of lipotoxic lipids, while promoting low-density lipoprotein (LDL) uptake and favourable effects on lipid profiles. A number of THR-β agonists are currently being investigated for NASH. This review focuses on resmetirom, an orally administered, once-daily, small-molecule, liver-directed, ß-selective THR agonist, as it is furthest along in development. Data from completed clincal studies outlined in this review demonstrate that resmetirom is effective in reducing hepatic fat content as measured by magnetic resonance imaging-derived proton density fat fraction, reduces liver enzymes, improves non-i nvasive markers of liver fibrogenesis and decreases liver stiffness, while eliciting a favourable cardiovascular profile with a reduction in serum lipids, including LDL cholesterol. Topline phase III biopsy data showed resolution of NASH and/or fibrosis improvement after 52 weeks of treatment, with more detailed peer-reviewed findings anticipated in order to certify these findings. Longer term clinical outcomes from both MAESTRO-NASH and MAESTRO-NASH OUTCOMES will be a pivotal juncture in the drug's road towards being approved as a NASH therapeutic.",2023,May,TouchREVIEWS in endocrinology,Gres Karim; Meena B Bansal,2110,True,2023-05-01

40949142,Barriers and facilitators to non-pharmacological management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease: a qualitative evidence synthesis.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) represents a significant global health concern, with limited pharmacological options despite extensive research efforts. While the recent conditional approval of resmetirom for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis with significant or advanced fibrosis has marked a major therapeutic milestone, lifestyle interventions-primarily dietary modifications and structured physical activity-remain the foundation of MASLD management for most patients. However, integrating these non-pharmacological strategies into routine clinical practice remains a significant challenge. In this qualitative evidence synthesis, we searched the PubMed, Scopus, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases to identify and categorize the principal barriers and facilitators influencing the implementation of lifestyle interventions in MASLD care. The analysis identified 67 barriers and 64 facilitators. To address these multifaceted challenges, we propose a multidisciplinary management framework anchored in six core principles: (1) strategic integration of diverse professional expertise with clear role delineation; (2) patient-centered interventions that address both societal and individual barriers while leveraging facilitators; (3) early preventive measures to halt disease progression prior to the development of significant fibrosis; (4) tailored approaches responsive to disease severity and comorbidities; (5) optimized monitoring protocols with specific thresholds for intervention adjustment; and (6) judicious incorporation of digital health technologies, accounting for variability in digital literacy. We conclude that understanding both barriers and facilitators is essential for developing adaptable, patient-centered interventions. Our findings may provide a roadmap for addressing implementation challenges in non-pharmacological MASLD management, emphasizing the importance of preventive, tailored, multidisciplinary approaches that begin early and evolve with disease progression.",2025,01,Frontiers in pharmacology,Yusuf Yilmaz,2057,True,2025-01-01

The cardiovascular actions at these receptors are well studied, but less is known about their combination. The aim was to explore the acute haemodynamic effects of dual agonism at the GLP-1 and glucagon receptor. Healthy male participants attended randomized, saline-controlled intravenous infusion studies using glucagon (low, 25 ng/kg/min), glucagon (high, 50 ng/kg/min), exenatide (loading dose 50 ng/min for 30 min then 25 ng/min) and exenatide:glucagon co-infusion for 120 min in Part A (glucagon dose-comparison study) and 60 min in Part B (dual-agonism study).

This meta-analysis aimed to quantify the magnitude of weight regain after reaching peak weight loss, and to compare rebound effects across four commonly used agents: semaglutide, liraglutide, exenatide, and orlistat. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed (n = 498), Cochrane Library (n = 41), Scopus (n = 258), ScienceDirect (n = 248), and Web of Science (n = 158) from January 2010 to October 2024. After removing 153 duplicates, 950 records were screened. Following full-text assessment, 36 studies were included in the final analysis.

Risk of bias was assessed using RoB 2.0, and meta-analyses were conducted with Comprehensive Meta-Analysis (v3.7), using mean difference (MD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). I² statistics were used to assess heterogeneity, and Egger's and Begg's tests were used to evaluate publication bias. Semaglutide showed the highest weight regain after discontinuation (MD = -5.15 kg; 95% CI: -5.27 to -5.03), followed by exenatide (MD = -3.06 kg; 95% CI: -3.91 to -2.22), liraglutide (MD = -1.50 kg; 95% CI: -2.41 to -0.26), and orlistat (MD = -1.66 kg; 95% CI: -2.75 to -0.58). Heterogeneity was moderate to high (I² ranging from 41.7% to 99.7%). Egger's test showed significant bias for liraglutide (p = 0.013), while no major bias was found for the other agents.

Before the switch, either dulaglutide or semaglutide was used as the GLP-1RA. Clinical findings were analyzed before and six months after switching to tirzepatide. Additionally, a multiple regression analysis was performed to determine whether characteristics and test results before switching to tirzepatide could predict the weight loss and MASLD suppression six months after initiation. The fatty liver index and fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) index were utilized as MASLD indicators. High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) levels from residual serum were measured as an indicator of chronic inflammation.  Six months after switching to tirzepatide, significant reductions in body weight, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level, fatty liver index, FIB-4 index, and hsCRP level were observed. The multiple regression analysis identified age, duration of type 2 diabetes, and HbA1c levels before the switch as significant independent predictors of weight loss rate. Also, the multiple regression analysis suggested that age before the switch may serve as a useful predictor of a decrease in fatty liver index. The effect of tirzepatide on appetite was less pronounced in the group that had used semaglutide before the switch compared with the group that had used dulaglutide; however, even in the semaglutide group, significant reductions in body weight, HbA1c levels, fatty liver index, and FIB-4 index were noted six months after the switch.  This study suggested the efficacy of switching from GLP-1RAs to tirzepatide among Japanese patients with type 2 diabetes and MASLD. Predictors of weight loss and fatty liver index reduction after switching to tirzepatide were identified. Additionally, we found that the therapeutic effect of tirzepatide can be expected even in patients who were using semaglutide before the switch.",2025,May,Cureus,Hideyuki Okuma,2358,True,2025-05-01

40590228,Therapeutic horizons in metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the progressive inflammatory form of MASLD, is now a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide. Driven by obesity and type 2 diabetes, MASH significantly increases the risk of cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma, and liver failure. While public health interventions remain essential, therapeutic strategies targeting metabolic dysfunction, inflammation, and fibrosis are urgently needed. This Review focuses on pharmacological treatments in advanced development, including incretin-based therapies (GLP-1, dual, and triple agonists), metabolic modulators (PPAR, FGF21, and THR-β agonists), and novel agents such as fatty acid synthase inhibitors. Current regulatory approval is based on histological end points, with increasing interest in noninvasive biomarkers and personalized treatment approaches. Recent trials with agents such as semaglutide, tirzepatide, survodutide, lanifibranor, pegozafermin, and resmetirom demonstrate substantial promise in resolving MASH and improving fibrosis, but unresolved issues remain regarding treatment duration, response heterogeneity, and long-term adherence. Genetic variants (e.g., PNPLA3 polymorphisms) and emerging molecular biomarkers may enhance stratification, while artificial intelligence is beginning to shape trial design and drug development. As the field moves toward combination therapies and precision medicine, the definition of therapeutic success will likely evolve to reflect both histological improvement and patient-reported outcomes. This Review provides a timely synthesis of the landscape, challenges, and future directions in MASH therapeutics.",2025,Jul,The Journal of clinical investigation,Philip N Newsome; Rohit Loomba,1674,True,2025-07-01
41132144,GLP-1 Receptor Agonist Therapy and Cardiorenal Outcomes in Patients ≥ 80 Years Old With Type 2 Diabetes.,"Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RAs) have demonstrated potential in improving glycemic control and reducing adverse outcomes in patients with Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); however, their efficacy in individuals aged 80 years and older remains understudied. To evaluate the efficacy of GLP-1 RAs compared with dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4i) in patients aged ≥ 80 years with T2DM. De-identified records from the TriNetX United States database identified 284,417 patients aged ≥ 80 years with T2DM, including 12,032 new GLP-1 RA users and 28,230 new DPP4i users, analyzed from January 2018 to December 2022. This retrospective cohort study utilized a new-user and active comparator design to evaluate clinical outcomes between GLP-1 RA and DPP4i users during a follow-up period of up to 5 years. Propensity score matching, incorporating all the baseline covariates, was used to minimize baseline differences. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for clinical outcomes. Sensitivity analyses were performed to validate the findings. After 1:1 propensity score matching, 11,464 patients were included in each group. Both cohorts had a mean age of 81.6 years; 47.7% were female, and 67% were White. GLP-1 RA users had significantly lower risks of major adverse cardiovascular events (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.81-0.91), major adverse kidney events (HR: 0.86, 95% CI: 0.82-0.91), all-cause hospitalization (HR: 0.91, 95% CI: 0.84-0.97), and all-cause mortality (HR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.77-0.88) compared with DPP4i users. No significant differences were observed between the groups in the rate of heart failure or bone fractures. GLP-1 RAs may offer substantial cardiorenal and survival benefits in patients aged 80 years and older with T2DM. These findings support the use of GLP-1 RAs as a therapeutic option in this high-risk, older population.",2025,Oct,Journal of the American Geriatrics Society,Jui-Cheng Chen; Yu-Wei Fang; Ya-Fang Liu; Mon-Ting Chen; Ming-Hsien Tsai,1911,True,2025-10-01
40998023,A synergic GLP-1/Acylethanolamide-based combined therapy for MAFLD: Studies in rat models.,"Obesity remains a major epidemic in developed countries, with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD) as one of its main hepatic consequences. Pharmacological treatments for MAFLD are limited, but modulation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) or acylethanolamide signalling offers promising therapeutic potential, while exerting anti-obesity effects. This study evaluated the effects of a combined therapy using a dual ligand targeting peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARα) and peripheral cannabinoid receptor 1 (CB1) (OLHHA, acting as a PPARα agonist and CB1 antagonist) in combination with the GLP-1 receptor agonist liraglutide. Our aim was to assess their potential as a multitarget therapy to ameliorate liver dysfunction in an obesity animal model. In Wistar rats, we evaluated the effects of administering 3 mg/kg OLHHA and 25  µg/kg liraglutide, both acutely and chronically (daily for 42 days), in the context of exposure to a high-fat/high-fructose diet. Although both OLHHA and liraglutide individually ameliorated certain hepatic alterations induced by MAFLD, our findings demonstrate that their combined administration was significantly more effective in promoting body weight loss, improving lipid profiles and transaminase levels, and exerting robust antisteatotic effects in obese rats. This enhanced efficacy was evidenced by a marked reduction in hepatic fat content, downregulation of lipogenesis-related enzymes, and upregulation of proteins involved in lipid oxidation. Moreover, OLHHA, either alone or in combination with liraglutide, efficiently restored redox balance disrupted by MAFLD in obese rats. Collectively, these results highlight the potential of this multitarget therapeutic strategy for the treatment of obesity, MAFLD, and their associated comorbidities.",2025,Dec,Biochemical pharmacology,Marialuisa de Ceglia; Rubén Tovar; Miguel Rodríguez-Pozo; Antonio Vargas; Ana Gavito; Juan Suárez; Elena Baixeras; Fernando Rodríguez de Fonseca; Juan Decara,1820,True,2025-12-01
41152279,Permeation enhancer-induced membrane defects assist the oral absorption of peptide drugs.,"The passive membrane permeation of small-molecule drugs and small hydrophobic peptides is relatively well understood. In contrast, how long polar peptides can pass through a membrane has remained a mystery. This process can be achieved with permeation enhancers, contributing significantly to the oral transcellular absorption of important peptide drugs like semaglutide - the active pharmaceutical ingredient in Ozempic, which is used as Rybelsus in a successful oral formulation. Here we now provide a detailed, plausible molecular mechanism of how such a polar peptide can realistically pass through a membrane paired with the permeation enhancer salcaprozate sodium (SNAC). We provide both simulation results, obtained with scalable continuous constant pH molecular dynamics (CpHMD) simulations, and experimental evidence (NMR, DOSY, and DLS) to support this unique permeation mechanism. Our combined evidence points toward the formation of permeation-enhancer-filled, fluid membrane defects, in which the polar peptide can be submerged in a process analogous to quicksand.",2025,Oct,Nature communications,Kyle J Colston; Kyle T Faivre; Severin T Schneebeli,1078,True,2025-10-01
40984942,A Review of Weight Loss With Glucagon-Like Peptide 1 Agonist Therapy: Is There a Role for Its Preoperative Use in Gynecology?,"Glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) agonist use for weight loss has skyrocketed. Dramatic weight loss with GLP-1 agonist use is frequently portrayed on social media. Contrastingly, such extensive weight loss has not been reported in published randomized controlled trials on weight loss after GLP-1 agonist use. However, these medications have been used for perioperative optimization in bariatric and orthopedic surgery. Therefore, there may be some applications in other surgical fields, particularly for reducing weight prior to surgery. Rising rates of obesity warrant the evaluation of preoperative GLP-1 agonists in gynecology to reduce surgery morbidity. We reviewed clinical trial-level data on GLP-1 agonist-related weight loss in hopes of completing a cost-effectiveness analysis. However, our review demonstrated that there are no current publications in patients undergoing benign hysterectomy to complete a robust cost-effectiveness analysis. Despite this, this review revealed important information about the use of GLP-1 agonists. It informs both clinicians and patients about realistic expectations for weight loss and how these therapies may be considered in a surgical framework. The goal of this narrative review is to report expected weight loss after these medications, frame the current data into a clinical context in gynecology, and demonstrate the urgent need to scientifically evaluate the role of preoperative GLP-1 agonist use in patients undergoing hysterectomy.",2025,Aug,Cureus,Annika Sinha; Evan R Myers; Anthony G Visco,1488,True,2025-08-01
37994050,Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 antagonist (EPGN2154) causes regression of NASH in preclinical NASH models.,"NASH causes a tremendous health care burden in the United States. A glucagon-like peptide-1 agonist, semaglutide (Sema), treatment resulted in hepatic steatosis reduction in clinical trials of NASH. Lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 antagonists are known to have antifibrotic effects in several organs. We tested Sema and a novel lysophosphatidic acid receptor 1 antagonist, EPGN2154, individually and in combination to evaluate their efficacy for NASH remission in preclinical models. In the present study, we used (1) C57Bl6/J wild-type mice fed on a high-fat, high-carbohydrate (HFHC) diet for 16 weeks and (2) leptin-deficient mice (ob/ob) fed on an Amylin liver NASH diet for 16 weeks. After 16 weeks, the mice were randomly distributed in equal numbers in (1) no-drug, (2) EPGN2154, (3) Sema, and (4) EPGN2154+Sema treatment groups for 8 additional weeks at a dosage of 10 mg/kg body weight for EPGN2154 (oral gavage, 5 days a week) and 6.17 μg/kg body weight of Sema (subcutaneous injection every alternate day, 3 days a week). In the wild-type-high-fat, high-carbohydrate model, we observed the most body weight loss in the EPGN2154+Sema combination group compared to the other treatment groups. All groups led to a significant reduction in alanine transaminase levels when compared to high-fat, high-carbohydrate-fed wild type. However, no significant difference in alanine transaminase levels was observed among the treatment groups. In the ob/ob mice study, Sema did not cause body weight loss. Moreover, the EPGN2154 and the combination groups had a lower NAFLD Activity Score and incidence of advanced-stage hepatic fibrosis than the Sema group. EPGN2154 demonstrated a hepato-protective effect independent of body weight loss in preclinical NASH models.",2023,Dec,Hepatology communications,Jashdeep Bhattacharjee; Graham Beaton; Satheesh B Ravula; Suk Joong Lee; Kevin B Bacon; Celia P Jenkinson; Mikako Warren; Fabio C Tucci; Rohit Kohli,1767,True,2023-12-01
41152066,The Bubble-Destruction Curve Obtained Using Contrast-Enhanced Ultrasound is Useful for Assessing Liver Fibrosis and Identifying At-risk MASH in Patients With MASLD.,"Metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and its progressive form, metabolic-dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), are becoming increasingly prevalent, with liver fibrosis (FIB) being a predictor of poor prognosis. Non-invasive tools for assessment of FIB and early detection of at-risk MASH are essential for effective clinical management. This study evaluated the clinical usefulness of a novel ultrasound (US)-based analytical tool, the bubble-destruction curve, which is derived using contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), for non-invasive assessment of liver FIB and identification of at-risk MASH in patients with MASLD. Ninety-five patients with biopsy-proven MASLD underwent CEUS using Sonazoid as the contrast agent. Flash imaging was performed during the post-vascular (Kupffer) phase to generate the bubble-destruction curve, which calculates three parameters: bubble-destruction depth (BDD), bubble-destruction slope and amount of bubble accumulation. These values were analyzed in relation to histological staging of FIB, blood biomarkers, elastography parameters and the presence of at-risk MASH. BDD showed a significant correlation with histological FIB stage, shear wave elastography and the FIB-4 index. The diagnostic performance of BDD for cirrhosis (F4) yielded an area under the curve of 0.92. A predictive model that combines BDD, aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and sex, called the AS-BDD-MASH score, demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy for at-risk MASH, with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.847. The bubble-destruction curve derived from CEUS is a feasible and accurate approach for evaluating liver FIB in patients with MASLD. Furthermore, a composite model combining BDD derived from the bubble-destruction curve with AST and sex demonstrated good diagnostic accuracy for identifying at-risk MASH.",2025,Oct,Ultrasound in medicine & biology,Noritaka Wakui; Yu Ogino; Naohisa Kamiyama; Takuma Oguri; Tomoya Uchimura; Takahide Kudo; Kenichi Maruyama; Hideki Nagumo; Naoyuki Yoshimine; Kunihide Mouri; Kojiro Kobayashi; Takanori Mukozu; Teppei Matsui; Hidenari Nagai; Yoshinori Igarashi; Takahisa Matsuda,1883,True,2025-10-01
41155431,Innovative Therapeutic Approaches Targeting Obesity: Can Flavonoids Improve the Efficacy of Anti-Obesogenic Drugs?,"Obesity is a chronic, multifactorial metabolic disease associated with various factors such as insulin resistance, increased adipogenesis, induction of gluconeogenesis, epigenetic mechanisms, chronic inflammatory state, and oxidative stress. Anti-obesity drugs such as Semaglutide and Tirzepatide are currently used in therapies for obese patients and exert remarkable anti-obesogenic effects, determining weight loss and inhibition of insulin resistance. The impairment of the adipogenesis process and the inhibition of the differentiation of human bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells into adipocytes should also be considered to improve the therapeutic strategies for obesity. Notably, the ability of several flavonoids to inhibit adipogenesis has been described. Flavonoids are the most abundant polyphenols in the human diet and exhibit a wide range of biological properties, including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects. Furthermore, many flavonoids can modulate the activity of enzymes involved in epigenetic mechanisms, which play a crucial role in obesity development. The purpose of this review is the identification of those flavonoids able to exert anti-adipogenic and anti-obesity effects in both in vitro and in vivo experimental models, with the aim of combining these natural molecules, as adjuvants, with anti-obesogenic drugs to develop innovative therapeutic approaches for the treatment of obesity pathology.",2025,Oct,International journal of molecular sciences,Emanuele-Salvatore Scarpa; Stefano Amatori; Giovanni Caprioli; Filippo Maggi; Gianluca Moroncini; Giancarlo Balercia; Gilberta Giacchetti,1434,True,2025-10-01

However, the postoperative safety profile of these medications in patients undergoing common hand procedures remains poorly studied. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of preoperative GLP-1 agonists use on postoperative complications, readmission, and reoperation following several commonly performed hand procedures. A retrospective study using a large insurance claims database was performed from 2015 to 2022. Patients undergoing six common hand procedures were queried. Individuals taking GLP-1 agonists at the time of surgery were propensity score-matched to those not taking the medications in a 1:4 fashion controlling for numerous clinical variables. Postoperative complications, 90-day readmission, 90-day reoperation for infection, and 2-year all-cause revision rates were then calculated between both groups using multivariable logistic regression. Patients taking GLP-1 agonists had equal or lower odds of postoperative infections including lower rates of surgical site infections and equal rates of wound dehiscence. These patients also had lower risk of postoperative pneumonia, acute kidney injury, hematoma, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis. Risk of all-cause 90-day readmission was significantly lower for patients taking GLP-1 agonists. Rates of 90-day reoperation for infection and 2-year all-cause revision were equal between both cohorts. This study found that patients taking GLP-1 agonists were at no higher risk for 90-day postoperative infections including surgical site infections and wound dehiscence. Furthermore, these patients demonstrated equal or lower rates of overall perioperative complications, reoperation, and readmission compared to their matched controls.

41142725,Association of sugary beverages consumption with liver fat content and fibro-inflammation: a large cohort study.,"Liver fat content (LFC) and hepatic fibro-inflammation (HFI) accumulation are the primary pathological manifestation of steatohepatitis. The association between intake of sugary beverages (SBs), including artificially-sweetened beverages (ASB), sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB), and natural juices (NJs), and LFC or HFI remains unclear. The study included 25,885 participant who completed at least one online dietary assessment and magnetic resonance imaging. LFC and HFI were quantified using the liver proton density fat fraction (PDFF) and iron-corrected T1 (cT1). Compared to those without ASB and SSB intake, the arithmetic mean difference (AMD) of PDFF was 0.15 (95% Cl: 0.06 to 0.24) and 0.21 (95% Cl, 0.12 to 0.29), and the AMD of cT1 was 3.86 (95% CI, 1.26 to 6.79) and 2.43 (95% CI, 1.31 to 3.57) in individuals with ≥1 serving/d, respectively. Individuals with 0-1 serving/d had lower PDFF (AMD: -0.10 95%Cl: -0.19 to -0.01) than those without NJs intake. In Quantile G-computation models, SSB and ASB contributed most in the AMD of PDFF (54.7%) and cT1 (53.1%), respectively. When replacing ASB and SSB with water, the progress of PDFF was improved.

This retrospective study included 824 patients treated with LSG or LRYGB between January 2014 and August 2022 at the First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University. A 1:1 propensity score matching method was used to compare the LSG and LRYGB groups. Differences in weight loss outcomes, changes in biochemical levels, and differences in nutritional status at 6- and 12- months postoperatively were assessed in different Chinese populations. LSG and LRYGB groups each comprised 412 patients. The baseline characteristics of the two groups showed no significant differences. However, patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) who underwent LRYGB exhibited significantly reduced glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels compared to those who had LSG after the 12-month postoperative follow-up. Alanine Aminotransferase (ALT) and Aspartate Aminotransferase (AST) levels are reduced in patients with nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). Alcohol consumption was shown to adversely affect surgical outcomes, with a notable association observed in postoperative weight regain. Females had lower body mass index (BMI) and blood glucose levels 6 months after LSG and lower BMI and blood pressure levels 12 months after LRYGB. Bariatric surgery caused severe nutritional deficiencies, notably affecting vitamin D levels, with over 60% of patients in both groups experiencing insufficiency postoperatively. Both LSG and LRYGB surgeries were determined to be safe and efficacious. LSG proved particularly beneficial for patients with NAFLD, while LRYGB was more efficacious for those with T2DM, hypercholesterolemia, and hypertensive women.",2025,Oct,Obesity surgery,Ruixiang Hu; Kaisheng Yuan; Zilong Wu; Zhiyong Dong; Wah Yang; Cunchuan Wang; Bing Wu,1796,True,2025-10-01

A cross-sectional survey was conducted in the outpatient and inpatient units of the Endocrinology Department at Baoding First Hospital of Traditional Chinese Medicine between September, 2023, and March, 2024. Data and KAP scores were collected using a self-designed questionnaires. The survey yielded 511 valid responses. Of these respondents, 361 (70.65%) were patients, and 177 (34.64%) were diagnosed with NAFLD. The mean scores for knowledge, attitudes, and practices among patients were 5.20 ± 3.37, 37.98 ± 3.96, and 41.85 ± 5.92, respectively, while the scores among patients' family members were 6.42 ± 4.22, 37.72 ± 4.46, and 41.31 ± 7.02, respectively.

This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the efficacy and safety of traditional GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4is, and SGLT-2is compared with insulin. Comprehensive searches were conducted in the Cochrane Database, PubMed, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov, and EMBASE for publications from January 2010 to June 2022, with an additional search extended through June 2025 to capture newly published studies. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing insulin with established GLP-1 RAs, DPP-4is, or SGLT-2is were included. Thirteen trials involving 5,807 participants were identified. Nine trials compared GLP-1 RAs to insulin, four compared DPP-4is to insulin, and one examined SGLT-2i combined with DPP-4i versus insulin. Compared with insulin, traditional non-insulin agents were associated with greater reductions in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (mean difference (MD) = -0.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.5 to -0.03), body weight (MD = -3.27, 95% CI -4.16 to -2.38), and systolic blood pressure (MD = -3.55, 95% CI -4.92 to -2.17). Insulin use carried a higher relative risk of hypoglycemia (risk ratio (RR) = 2.24, 95% CI 1.88-2.67). Subgroup analyses showed that GLP-1 RAs were superior to insulin in reducing HbA1c and hypoglycemic events, whereas DPP-4is achieved similar glycemic control with improved safety profiles.

The novel antiobesity medications achieve marked bodyweight loss and improve associated metabolic conditions, including MASLD. This review summarizes the development and mode of action and available published data on the effectiveness of approved and potential (off-label) antiobesity products in the management of adult and pediatric obesity and MASLD. Additionally, their safety is highlighted. The most effective antiobesity drugs evaluated in double-blind, randomized controlled trials include semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide with up to 10.8%, 17.8%, and 22.1% placebo-subtracted bodyweight loss, respectively, in adults after 48-72 weeks. Semaglutide also reduces placebo-subtracted body mass index mean by up to 16.7% in adolescents with obesity after 68 weeks. Moreover, these novel drugs are highly effective in treating adults with MASLD. Semaglutide and tirzepatide resolve metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) without worsening of fibrosis placebo-subtracted in 41% and 53% of patients, respectively, after 52-72 weeks. Semaglutide, tirzepatide, and retatrutide reduce hepatic fat on magnetic resonance imaging-proton density fat fraction placebo-subtracted by 41%, 47%, and 81%, respectively, after 48-72 weeks. Tirzepatide also decreases fibrosis without worsening of MASH placebo-subtracted in up to 25% of patients. However, no pediatric trials have been conducted to study these novel drugs in biopsy-proven MASLD. In conclusion, the novel antiobesity drugs are highly effective in obesity and MASLD.

41057943,Structural and evolutionary features of red algal UV sex chromosomes.,"Sex chromosomes in red algae have remained relatively understudied, despite their fundamental role in understanding the evolution of sex determination across eukaryotes. In this study, we investigate the structure, gene composition, and evolutionary history of the U and V sex chromosomes in four Gracilaria species, which diverged approximately 100 million years ago. Our findings reveal that UV sex chromosomes, previously identified in green and brown algae as well as bryophytes, have also evolved in red algae, contributing to the diversity of sex determination systems across eukaryotes. The shared orthology of conserved sex-determining region genes between Gracilaria and distantly related red algae suggests that this system may have originated approximately 390 million years ago, making it one of the oldest known sex chromosome systems. The sex-determining region in Gracilaria is relatively small but contains conserved gametologs and V-specific genes involved in transcriptional regulation and signaling, suggesting their essential role in sexual differentiation. Unlike the conserved V-specific genes, U-specific genes appear absent, pointing to a dominant role of the V chromosome in sex determination. Despite their ancient origin, the sex chromosomes show low levels of degeneration, likely due to haploid purifying selection during the gametophytic phase of the life cycle. This study provides the first large-scale comparative genomic and transcriptomic analysis of the U and V sex chromosomes across multiple red algal species, preparing the ground for future studies on reproductive life cycles and speciation in this understudied group of eukaryotes.",2025,Oct,Genome biology,Agnieszka P Lipinska; Guillaume Cossard; Paul Epperlein; Tobias Woertwein; Cecile Molinier; Olivier Godfroy; Sabrina Carli; Ligia Ayres-Ostrock; Emma Lavaut; Fabiana Marchi; Stephane Mauger; Christophe Destombe; Mariana C Oliveira; Estela M Plastino; Stacy A Krueger-Hadfield; Marie-Laure Guillemin; Myriam Valero; Susana M Coelho,1674,True,2025-10-01
41022666,GLP-1 receptor agonists and non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy: what an endocrinologist needs to know.,"There is emerging evidence suggesting a possible association between glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1 RA) and non-arteritic anterior ischaemic optic neuropathy (NAION) with retrospective cohort studies supporting this association reporting hazard ratios ranging from 2.19 to 7.74 when comparing exposed vs unexposed groups. This article explores the current research surrounding the risk of NAION with GLP-1 RA use in patients with type 2 diabetes and obesity, analyses patient factors that may increase susceptibility and highlights key areas warranting further research to guide endocrinologists in future prescribing. Whilst the emerging evidence suggests a possible association between commencement of GLP-1 RAs and NAION, absolute risk remains low and needs to be balanced with the known substantial benefits of GLP-1 RAs. Further research is needed to investigate whether specific patient characteristics such as optic disc parameters, blood pressure changes, degree of weight loss or improvement of glycaemic control can assist clinicians in identifying those at higher risk.",2025,Sep,The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism,Livia Liu; Sharanya Mohan; Linda Wu,1099,True,2025-09-01
41064446,Betulinic acid and obesity-related disorders.,"The obesity epidemic is not just a health issue, it is increasingly driving a shift in the prevalence of chronic diseases, affecting 890 million adults and straining healthcare systems worldwide. Conditions such as type 2 diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular diseases, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and various cancer types are closely tied to this growing crisis. Betulinic acid has anti-inflammatory, antioxidant and anti-cancer properties and modulates key metabolic pathways such as NF-κB and AMPK signaling. This compound improves insulin sensitivity, reduces hepatic steatosis, mitigates the progression of atherosclerosis and fibrosis, and suppresses inflammatory responses, which are important in treating those obesity-related disorders. Additionally, betulinic acid use in cancer treatment has been explored due to its potential in angiogenesis and metastasis inhibition and promotion of apoptosis. This review spotlights the therapeutic potential of the natural compound betulinic acid in processes such as insulin sensitivity, glucose and lipid metabolism, adiposity, inflammation, oxidative stress, intestinal microbiota, and other mechanisms underlying different obesity-related disorders. Overall, besides strong therapeutic potential of betulinic acid, described limitations such as poor aqueous solubility, limited bioavailability, production and extraction have resulted in scarce clinical data making it premature to draw definitive conclusions regarding its application in clinical practice.",2025,01,Frontiers in pharmacology,Lara Azevedo; Ricardo Ferraz; Mónica Vieira; Cristina Prudêncio; Sílvia Fernandes,1514,True,2025-01-01
41056349,Retatrutide Improves Steatohepatitis in an Accelerated Mouse Model of Diet-Induced Steatohepatitis with a Fructose Binge.,"Fructose consumption contributes to metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH). Retatrutide is a novel triple receptor agonist that improves obesity and hepatic steatosis in humans. The aims of this study were to develop a shortened and clinically relevant dietary mouse model of diet-induced steatohepatitis, and to evaluate the effects of a retatrutide intervention in this model. C57BL/6N mice were subjected to a single fructose binge (10 mg/g body weight), or a new 31-day mouse model of diet-induced steatohepatitis using western diet, fructose and sucrose in the drinking water, and a final fructose binge with or without retatrutide. A single fructose binge resulted in significantly elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatic triglyceride levels in female mice after 6 hours; male mice showed less hepatotoxicity. The novel 31-day feeding model significantly increased body weight, ALT levels, hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol, and hepatic inflammatory markers in female and male mice compared with their chow-fed controls. The overall hepatic gene expression profile per RNA sequencing of treated mice correlated with that of human MASH in children and adults. Retatrutide intervention over the final 2 weeks of the 31-day mouse model significantly reduced body weight, ALT levels, hepatic triglycerides and cholesterol, and hepatic inflammatory markers in female mice compared with their vehicle-treated counterparts. Our findings indicate that female mice develop more severe liver injury due to a single fructose binge than males. The novel 31-day mouse model induces robust steatohepatitis and correlates with human disease. An intervention with retatrutide improves steatohepatitis in this shortened mouse model.",2025,Oct,American journal of physiology.

41059683,Marked Variation in Hepatic Steatosis in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease Over 5 Years: A Community-Based Study Using Controlled Attenuation Parameter.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is very common and associated with significant morbidity and mortality due to its potential progression to cirrhosis and liver cancer. Whereas hepatic fat accumulation is the key to MASLD progression, little is known regarding changes in liver fat content over time in the general population. We aimed to investigate changes in liver fat in a longitudinal study of the general population. We conducted a longitudinal study involving 195 randomly selected individuals from the general population, evaluated at two time points, 5 years apart. Participants with hepatic steatosis at baseline did not receive any specific treatment. The primary objective was to assess changes in liver fat content, as estimated by controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) using transient elastography. We also examined the frequency of steatosis resolution and development. CAP variability was assessed in two measurements 7 days apart in a cross-sectional study of 101 volunteers, with a mean variability of 9.9%. Steatosis resolution was defined as reduction of CAP > 10% from baseline with a final value < 275 dB/m, while steatosis development was defined as increase in CAP > 10% with a final value ≥ 275 dB/m. Remarkable variations in liver fat content were observed. Among the 88 participants with steatosis at baseline, 34% had resolution of steatosis (CAP decreased from 300 to 237 dB/m; p < 0.001). Resolution was associated with weight loss and reductions in transaminases and gamma-glutamyl transferase levels. In contrast, 29% of the 107 participants without steatosis at baseline developed it during follow-up. Increase in liver stiffness measurement (≥ 8 kPa) was associated only with persistent hepatic steatosis but not with steatosis resolution. There is marked variation in liver fat content among participants from the general population over a period of 5 years, indicating its dynamic nature.

Pleiotropic Metabolic Effect of Novel Antidiabetic Drugs in Patients with Diabetes-Interventional Study.,"Metabolic Dysfunction-associated Steatotic Liver Disease (MASLD) is associated with the excessive collection of lipids in hepatocytes. Over 75% of diabetes patients typically have MASLD, and, at the same time, the presence of MASLD increases the risk of diabetes by more than two times. Type 2 diabetes and MASLD are independent cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors. New diabetes treatment should also take into account pleiotropic effects that reduce cardiovascular risk. The aim of our study is to investigate whether analogs of GLP1 receptors have a pleiotropic metabolic effect and global impact to decrease cardiovascular risk, and also reduce the risk of hepatic fibrosis in patients with MASLD.

MASLD's strong association with obesity and type 2 diabetes positions it as an increasingly prevalent indication for liver transplantation. Hence, this study sought to assess the prevalence of MASLD as an indication for liver transplantation, to characterize the clinical and epidemiological profile of the affected population, and to investigate the rates of post-transplant recurrence and de novo occurrence. We also compared survival outcomes between recipients with MASLD and other etiologies. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective analysis of 610 patients listed for liver transplantation at Hospital das Clínicas (University of São Paulo) between 2005 and 2015. Data regarding demographics, comorbidities, and post-transplant outcomes were collected from medical records. The statistical analysis encompassed both descriptive and inferential methods. Results: Out of 610 patients, 61 (10%) were diagnosed with MASLD-related cirrhosis, presenting a waitlist mortality rate of 42.6%. Among the 264 who received transplants, 36 (13.6%) had MASLD as the primary diagnosis. Post-transplantation, 58 recipients developed steatosis, with 82.8% of these cases being de novo allograft steatosis. Pre-transplant obesity and hypertension were identified as significant risk factors. Importantly, patients undergoing transplantation for MASLD showed lower survival rates compared to those with other etiologies. Conclusion: MASLD patients who undergo liver transplantation exhibit distinctive clinical outcomes and reduced survival rates. These findings underscore the critical need for targeted risk assessments and developing long-term strategies to enhance the prognosis for this increasingly common patient demographic.",2025,Oct,Archives of endocrinology and metabolism,Felipe Ramos Caprini; Fernanda Fernandes de Souza; Ajith Kumar Sankarankutty; Roberta Chaves Araújo,1902,True,2025-10-01
40993341,Incretin Dominance and Emerging Mechanisms in Obesity Pharmacotherapy: Insights from 275 Registered Clinical Trials (2019-2024).,"Obesity remains a critical global health challenge, with rising prevalence and a substantial cardiometabolic and psychosocial burden. Recent therapeutic advances, particularly in incretin-based strategies, underscore the need for a comprehensive characterization of the evolving pharmacological landscape. We conducted a systematic review of clinical trials registered on ClinicalTrials.gov between October 2019 and October 2024, focusing on pharmacological interventions for obesity from early exploratory stages to Phase 3. A total of 275 eligible trials were identified and analyzed. Incretin pathway modulators predominated (69.8%), especially GLP-1 receptor agonists and dual or triple agonists targeting GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon receptors. Most trials were in Phase 2 (40.7%) or Phase 3 (31.3%), indicating a maturing pipeline, while early-stage innovation remained limited (3.3% of trials). Drug repurposing was common (22.2%), notably involving semaglutide and liraglutide, originally approved for type 2 diabetes. Industry-sponsored trials constituted the majority (75.3%), with limited academic (22.2%) and governmental (2.5%) participation. Geographically, trials were concentrated in the United States, China, and Denmark, with relatively few international multicenter studies. While the obesity drug pipeline is expanding rapidly, it remains heavily centered on incretin-based therapies. This dominance, despite strong clinical efficacy, raises concerns regarding long-term safety, accessibility, and mechanistic diversity.

A retrospective disproportionality analysis was conducted using the reporting odds ratio (ROR) on FAERS data (2004-2024), with Bayesian confidence propagation neural network (BCPNN) employed for sensitivity analysis. Adverse reactions were compared between combination therapy and monotherapy (GLP-1 RAs or metformin alone), followed by stratified analyses by gender, age, and body weight. Among 48,214 reports (57.5% female), common AEs included nausea and weight loss. Unexpected signals included kidney injury and pancreatic cancer. Monotherapy showed higher AE rates. Males reported more renal calculi and early-onset AEs (≤ 30 days), while females had delayed AEs (> 360 days). Weight loss was consistent across all demographics. The combination therapy of GLP-1 receptor agonists and metformin demonstrates superior safety over monotherapy, while revealing novel adverse events and demographic-specific risk patterns, thereby offering reliable evidence to inform clinical practice.",2025,Oct,Scientific reports,Boyi Liu; Ruizhe Huang; Wenchao Zhang; Jie Tian; Xian Yao; Danna Chen,1104,True,2025-10-01
40089151,Updated recommendations for the management of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) by the Latin American working group.,"Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) is one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease globally. Based on the 2023 definition, MASLD is characterized by the presence of metabolic dysfunction and limited alcohol consumption (<140 grams/week for women, <210 grams/week for men). Given the significant burden of MASLD in Latin America, this guidance was developed by the Latin American Association for the Study of the Liver (ALEH) Working Group to address key aspects of its clinical assessment and therapeutic strategies. In Latin America, ultrasonography is recommended as the initial screening tool for hepatic steatosis due to its accessibility, while Fibrosis-4 (FIB-4) is preferred for fibrosis risk stratification, with further evaluation using more specific techniques (i.e., vibration-controlled transient elastography or Enhanced Liver Fibrosis [ELF] test). A Mediterranean diet is advised for all MASLD patients, with a target of 7-10% weight loss for those with excess weight. Complete alcohol abstinence is recommended for patients with significant fibrosis, and smoking cessation is encouraged regardless of fibrosis stage. Pharmacological options should be tailored based on the presence of steatohepatitis, liver fibrosis, excess weight, and diabetes, including resmetirom, incretin-based therapies, pioglitazone, and sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitors. Bariatric surgery may be considered for MASLD patients with obesity unresponsive to lifestyle and medical interventions. Hepatocellular carcinoma screening is advised for all cirrhotic patients, with consideration given to those with advanced fibrosis based on individual risk. Finally, routine cardiovascular risk assessment and proper diabetes prevention and management remain crucial for all patients with MASLD.",2025,Mar,Annals of hepatology,Luis Antonio Diaz; Juan Pablo Arab; Francisco Idalsoaga; Javiera Perelli; Javier Vega; Melisa Dirchwolf; Javiera Carreño; Bárbara Samith; Cynthia Valério; Rodrigo Oliveira Moreira; Mónica Acevedo; Javier Brahm; Nelia Hernández; Adrian Gadano; Claudia P Oliveira; Marco Arrese; Graciela Castro-Narro; Mario G Pessoa,1823,True,2025-03-01
41153573,Updates on Anti-Obesity Medications in Children and Adolescents.,"Childhood obesity has assumed epidemic proportions; it results from a complex interplay of genetic, physiological, socioeconomic, and environmental factors. It is associated with numerous short- and long-term health complications, including cardiometabolic and psychosocial consequences. While lifestyle modifications remain the cornerstone of treatment, their overall impact is modest. As a result, pharmacotherapy is increasingly recommended as an adjunct in selected pediatric patients, particularly those with severe or refractory obesity. In recent years, several anti-obesity medications, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists, have shown promise in pediatric populations, particularly adolescents. However, the pharmacologic options remain limited for younger children.

Resmetirom is the first Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment for MASH. The aim of this study was to evaluate the tolerability of resmetirom for the treatment of MASH fibrosis and factors affecting access, including insurance coverage and dispensing delays for patients that received at least 3 months of therapy. A retrospective chart review conducted at a large tertiary hospital for all (113) MASH patients prescribed resmetirom between April 2024 to September 2024 and who were treated for at least 3 months to assess their tolerability and any obstacles medication access. Resmetirom was prescribed for 137 patients, of whom 113 (85.5%) completed at least 3 months of treatment and met the inclusion criteria. Pertinent adverse effects were nausea and vomiting (12.4%) and diarrhea (12.4%). The mean baseline aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase values were 40.15 international units per liter (IU/L), 49.96 IU/L, and 83.04 IU/L, respectively. At 3 months of treatment, mean aspartate aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, and alkaline phosphatase values decreased to 36.15 IU/L, 45.38 IU/L, and 81.33 IU/L, respectively. Regarding insurance coverage for all patients prescribed resmetirom, 33 patients (24.1%) required an appeal, with 93.4% (128) ultimately receiving insurance approval. Average delay in prescription fill after insurance approval was 12.5 days. Resmetirom discontinuation incurred among 10 (8.8%) patients.

40815181,Safety Choice Drivers of the Coming Treatment Options for Non-Cirrhotic Metabolic Steatohepatitis.,"Metabolic dysfunction associated steatohepatitis (MASH), formerly known as NASH, represents one of the leading causes of chronic liver disease worldwide. Its high prevalence is driven by insulin resistance, obesity and type 2 diabetes (T2D) and is associated with cardiovascular disease. The main driver of liver damage is fat accumulation in hepatocytes leading to inflammation and fibrosis development. People with MASH and clinically significant fibrosis (stage F2/F3) are 'at risk' of progressing to cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma and are considered in need of treatment. Metabolic drivers of MASH originating outside the liver, for example, from the adipose tissue and the gut, and genetic heterogeneity contribute to making the prevalent pathogenetic factor difficult to dissect at an individual level. In this scenario, the Food and Drug Administration's conditional approval of the liver-directed thyroid hormone receptor beta agonist Resmetirom as the first pharmacological treatment for MASH last March 2024 and the expected extension of the glucagon-like protein-1 receptor agonist Semaglutide indication from diabetes and obesity to MASH mark a key milestone. Both drugs are also under evaluation by the European Medicines Agency. The proven efficacy of these compounds in clinical trials needs to be balanced against safety profiles and patient preferences. To investigate future trajectories and possible uses as mono-therapy or in combination, we examined available results of clinical trials and real-life studies.

41138960,"V8, a lysosomotropic wogonin derivative, alleviates hepatic steatosis by modulating GDF15-dependent mitochondrial homeostasis.","Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) has become a global epidemic, leading to an unmet medical need for pharmacological interventions. This study aims to investigate the protective effect and mechanism of a synthetic wogonin derivate V8 against hepatic steatosis. Herein, we report that V8 attenuates lipid accumulation and prevents mitochondrial dysfunction in hepatocytes. Growth differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), a well-known cytokine with powerful metabolic action, mediates the effect of V8 on lipid metabolic disorders. Mechanistically, due to its lysosomotropic property, V8 promotes nuclear translocation of transcription factor EB (TFEB) and subsequent GDF15 gene transcription through activating adenosine 5'-monophosphate (AMP)-activated protein kinase (AMPK). Further analysis demonstrates GDF15 mainly improves mitochondrial homeostasis under stressful condition. Consistently, Gdf15 ablation in mice results in aggravated hepatic lipid deposition and liver injury upon high-fat diet feeding. Moreover, V8 alleviates diet-induced hepatic steatosis in a GDF15-dependent manner, and improves toxins-induced hepatic pathological phenotypes accompanying with upregulation of GDF15. Collectively, these data demonstrate the beneficial metabolic effect of V8 and highlight its utility in treating hepatic steatosis and its associated metabolic complications.",2025,Oct,Free radical biology & medicine,Sichan Li; Shunzi Shao; Zhaokun Zhang; Zhuo Wang; Xiaolei Han; Xiaoqian Jia; Hongxin Zhang; Yuan Gao; Xiaobo Zhang,1395,True,2025-10-01

Although recent studies suggest variable surgical outcomes in patients using these medications, specific effects on breast surgery remain unclear. To compare postoperative outcomes following breast implant explantation with mastopexy between patients using GLP-1 receptor agonizts and matched controls. This retrospective comparative case series included 30 patients using GLP-1 receptor agonizts who underwent breast implant explantation with mastopexy, matched 1:1 with 30 control patients based on age, body mass index, and smoking status. Primary outcomes included overall complication rates, wound healing complications, and postoperative infections. Secondary outcomes included weight loss, revision rates, and nutritional parameters. GLP-1 patients demonstrated numerically higher overall complication rates compared to the controls (20% vs. 10%, p=0.47). Despite achieving greater weight loss (7.8 kg vs. 0.5 kg, p<0.001), GLP-1 patients experienced more wound healing complications (13.3% vs. 3.3%, p=0.35) and seroma formation (10% vs. 0%, p=0.24). GLP-1 patients had significantly lower serum albumin (4.06 ± 0.22 vs. 4.22 ± 0.17 g/dL, p=0.003) and prealbumin levels (23.52 ± 3.39 vs. 25.55 ± 3.10 mg/dL, p=0.02). No significant differences were observed in infection rates or revision requirements. This pilot study indicates that patients using GLP-1 receptor agonizts showed directional trends toward higher complication rates despite achieving significant weight loss. The observed nutritional differences, including low albumin and prealbumin levels, may contribute to increased wound healing complications. These findings suggest potential tissue-specific effects that warrant further investigation and specialized perioperative management protocols for breast surgery patients.

MASLD is defined by hepatic steatosis plus at least one cardiometabolic risk factor (CMRF). A new category, Met-ALD, describes MASLD with alcohol consumption below the defined thresholds for alcohol-associated liver disease (ALD). While adult studies have demonstrated strong concordance between NAFLD and MASLD, the applicability of this framework in children remains unclear. We assessed children clinically diagnosed with NAFLD and enrolled in the NASH CRN who had available liver histology. Clinical and demographic data, including body mass index (BMI), hepatotoxic medication use, and alcohol intake, were analyzed. Liver biopsies were centrally reviewed to confirm hepatic steatosis and evaluate for alternative etiologies. Participants were reclassified using the SLD framework. Among 1,019 children diagnosed with NAFLD, 858 (84%) met MASLD criteria. The average number of CMRFs per participant was 2.7±1.1; 41 (4.7%) met all five. Thirty-three participants (3.2%) were reclassified as Met-ALD, a prevalence that rose to 5.4% among adolescents. Sixty-six children (6.5%) were reclassified as drug-induced SLD. Most children with NAFLD met MASLD criteria, but nearly 1 in 6 were reclassified based on alcohol use or medication exposure.

41009771,An Emerging Paradigm for ABCC5/MRP5 Function in Human Physiology.,"Since the first paper published by Susan Cole in 1990 detailing multidrug resistance mediated by ABCC1/MRP1, research into the C-subfamily of ATP-binding cassette transporters has continued to uncover a wide range of functionally divergent proteins. However, several orphan transporters remain in the C-subfamily, and the physiological function and substrates of ABCC5, ABCC11, and ABCC12 remain elusive. This review explores the emerging understanding of human ABCC5. Unlike other ABC transporters with well-defined drug export functions, ABCC5's physiological roles remain only partially understood. While it is known for its involvement in multidrug resistance in cancers, recent studies suggest broader implications in development, metabolism, neurobiology, and male fertility. ABCC5 exports various endogenous substrates, including cyclic nucleotides (cAMP and cGMP), glutamate conjugates like NAAG, and possibly haem. Knockout models in mice, zebrafish, and sea urchins reveal ABCC5's role in gut formation, brain function, eye development, and iron metabolism. In mice, its deletion results in lower adipose tissue mass, enhanced insulin sensitivity, and neurobehavioral changes resembling schizophrenia, highlighting its role in glutamatergic signalling and circadian regulation. Functionally, ABCC5 appears to impact adipocyte differentiation and GLP-1 release, implicating it in type 2 diabetes susceptibility in humans. Structural studies using human ABCC5 revealed a novel autoinhibitory mechanism involving a peptide segment (C46-S64) that blocks substrate binding, offering new potential for selective inhibitor development. However, this review emphasises caution in targeting ABCC5 for cancer therapy due to its underappreciated physiological function(s), particularly in the brain and male reproductive system. Understanding ABCC5's substrate specificity, regulatory mechanisms, and functional redundancy with its paralog ABCC12 remains critical for successful therapeutic strategies in humans.",2025,Sep,International journal of molecular sciences,Jenai Chinoy; Charlotte Meller; Heidi de Wet,2012,True,2025-09-01
